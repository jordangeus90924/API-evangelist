        <span class="post-date">27 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-hypermedia.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking through each of the worlds, of my hypermedia panelists, <span>Mike Amundsen (</span><a href="https://bit.ly/1mtrwki">@mamund</a><span>), Mike Kelly (</span><a href="https://bit.ly/1hBxi4m">@mikekelly85</a><span>), Steve Klabnik (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">@steveklabnik</a><span>), Kevin Swiber (</span><a href="https://bit.ly/1oC7Udw">@kevinswiber</a><span>), J&oslash;rn Wildt (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/JornWildt">@JornWildt</a><span>), and Markus Lanthaler (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a><span>),&nbsp;</span>for <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API Craft</a> tomorrow, reaquainting myself on what they bring to the hypermedia table, adding to my knowledge, and hopefully sharing some of the findings with you.
<p>As I look through each of the hypermedia definitions, developed by my panelists, I keep feeling, that as API providers, there is still a lot of education that has to occur, to not just helping us better communicate with APIs, but also be more skilled at sharing and interacting around the resources we are making available via APIs.
<p>I&rsquo;ve been brushing up my knowledge on <a href="http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/format/">Collection+JSON</a>, <a href="https://rawgit.com/mamund/media-types/master/uber-hypermedia.html">UBER</a>, <a href="http://alps.io/">ALPS</a>, <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a>, <a href="http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/hydra/">Hydra</a>, <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>, <a href="http://jsonapi.org/">json:api</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JornWildt/Mason">Mason</a>--9 spearate format that contribute to how we design our APIs.
<p>When I think about the state of APIs, i see that we are barely using our words in our communication using APIs, what we say, and how we are saying it with our APIs, is still very crude, and unstructured. I feel like we are just toddlers, learning to use our words, sentences and playing nicely together. With the rich formats available to us, I feel that in 2014, I think we have to collectively get our butts to hypermeida school, and get educated&mdash;a lot of the work has been done for, we just need to get up to speed.
<p>I see a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/what-are-some-good-examples-of-hypermedia-apis/">handful of API providers employing hypermedia in their designs</a>, but they are still few and far between.

<p>I like to showcase examples of companies who use their API communities as incubators, establishing them as a sort of external R&amp;D lab that invests in 3rd party developers who are building cool stuff on top of their API driven resources.
<p>I came across an <a href="http://www.indix.com/blog/announcing-indix-api-v1-0-kickstart-program">announcement from product intelligence platform Indix</a>, in my usual monitoring of the API space, and they have a pretty cool program for their developers:
<blockquote><em>Indix KickStart &ndash; a program to help startups and small businesses accelerate the development of product-aware applications and deliver rich product-aware experiences.</em></blockquote>
<p>Indix is looking to jumpstart early stage startups use of the Indix product API. Companies that have less than $1 million in funding and $100,000 in revenue are eligible apply, and Indix will evaluate the startups potential for receiving access to the Indix API at a reduced price point.
<p>There are numerous ways to incentivize developers usage of an API, and Indix&rsquo;s approach is one possible way to established a trusted developer access tier, where you can raise access limits, reduce costs, and potentially reducing a new startup&rsquo;s overhead, and their chances of success.

        <span class="post-date">25 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-analytics-4.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;m in the middle of processing multiple emails, as well as coming down off an early morning conversation, all on the subject of analytics. A portion of the conversations are about analytics at the web site, web or mobile app level, and a portion of it was around analytics for API developers, as well as API platform providers&mdash;basically the full stack of analytics including platforms, developers, apps, all the way to the end-user.
<p>Increased visibility into the API layer, and how developers and their apps are consuming API resources, is a cornerstone of API management. There are numerous solutions out there to give you analytics in websites and web apps (<a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>), and within the mobile app itself (<a href="https://bit.ly/1rggWl3">Mixpanel</a>), and there are analytics at the API layer for both API providers, and the many developers who are integrating APIs into their applications and systems (<a href="https://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a>).
<p>API providers, with the assistance of API infrastructure solutions like <a href="https://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a>, have done very well in making sense of how resources are composed through a service composition layer, that includes a robust number of metrics and analytics for both provider and developer. This is great for allowing API providers to understand how developers, and their applications are consuming API resources, while at the same time delivering a subset of analytics for each individual developer regarding their individual API usage. This is great, but if a developer wants more application level information, they usually have to look elsewhere to other tools and services. (this is evolving)
<p>After my conversations this morning, I was left thinking big picture about the future of analytics for the API driven, multichannel, website, single page, mobile, and Iot application stack. I am left with a vision of a tool that can handle all channels, not just the needs of the platform, and its developers, but also bring the end-users in the conversation. I need a standalone, open source framework, that I can use for not just a single platform, but something that could deployed for each end users, so it can span multiple platforms, for a single user, or group of users.
<p>This is where it gets challenging, I&rsquo;m trying to think of this from a users perspective, abstracting away the provider, developer, and even the app, making the end-user the focus of the conversation. I still want to meet the needs of the provider and developers, I just want to shift the perspective, to the end deliverable, the actual &ldquo;thing&rdquo; we are looking to deliver, aka. the human element&mdash;moving the conversation furhter out of the business and geek realm.
<p>I immediately think of the <a href="http://tincanapi.com/">Tin Can API</a>, aka <a href="https://bit.ly/1lEVW0y">Experience API</a>. Ok, I have to admit <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@AudreyWatters</a> made me think of it, after I described the solution I was looking for, she said, &ldquo;that sounds like the Tin Can API&rdquo;?  To which I said DOH!!! If you are unfamiliar with the Experience API, they describe themselves as:
<blockquote><em>...a service that allows for statements of experience to be delivered to and stored securely in a Learning Record Store (LRS)...</em></blockquote>
<p>If we swap out the concept of an LRS for education, and call it a Platform Record Store(PRS), or if we are going to give it to each end-user to track across platforms, we call it a User Record Store (URS)&mdash;basically a online place to store your experiences. For education its an LRS, but for the wider API world I&rsquo;m calling it a PRS or URS, depending on how it is deployed.
<p>Regardless of where you store the data, the Experience API lets you record just that, &ldquo;experiences&rdquo;. You can define your own objects, and verbs (actions), to be taken against those objects. The Experience API gives you a language map, authentication, authority, and many other goodies to make each &ldquo;statement of experience&rdquo; as meaningful as possible. Ok, so you are thinking, WTF is all this? An experience API really? Ok, well to put it in geek speak, its a logging API, just in this scenario we are making it about user experience instead of app, API, or just platform needs. Entering a richer realm of context, and potentially asking much more meaningful questions, rather than just logging on some bullshit metric.
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore a little--If I&rsquo;m a platform provider I can track on the experiences that matter to me:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>/GET of a /user API resource</li>
<li>/POST of an /image API resource</li>
<li>/POST of a /blog API resource</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the API metrics that API providers are tracking on currently, and the <a href="https://bit.ly/1lEVW0y">Experience API</a> model accommodates these common API usage experiences, while also opening up a whole new world of exploration. I think this new model would encourage API providers to explore new ways of measuring their API usage, and how resources are actually being put to use--kind of like we've been doing for years with API infrastructure providers.
<p>From a developer&rsquo;s perspective, I can now can tap into those platform defined experiences for my account, and use across my apps. This is essentially what we have today from API infrastructure providers like 3Scale. Lets take to the next level, let&rsquo;s allow each developer to define their own experiences, that they can track on and use in their own applications, for example:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>View a users settings</li>
<li>Share of an image</li>
<li>View of a blog post</li>
<li>Logged out of app</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these experiences would be meaningful to the application developer, helping them understand how users are engaging with their apps. This layer of the experience stack would be open, allowing each developer to define&mdash;leaving it up to them whether they wanted to share with platform providers or not. (controversial!)
<p>Next, let's talk about end-users of applications that are built. We could also use this to drive end-user analytics, allowing them to see a report of their activity on any application, or depending on how this whole idea is deployed, across applications. It would provide a web and mobile dashboard like app users are growing accustom to, as well as provide a sort of notification layer, if end-users are interested.
<p><a href="http://tincanapi.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/tin-can-api/tin-can-api-scorm-cloud.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>What is important about this model is transparency. It gives platforms, and developers single place to record metrics (experiences), in a way that provides transparency to the end-user.(controversial!) We can also open up the experience definitions to the end-users, letting each end-user define the things that matter to them, and the experiences they want to capture. I imagine, this is only for the savvy app user, seems like you&rsquo;d end up with a lot of ridiculous experience statements, but even if 1% of the feedback was interesting, it could provide an interesting feedback loop about what really is meaningful to end-users. Not exactly sure how you&rsquo;d integrate user-defined experiences into the application operations, but at the minimum it could be a feedback mechanism, and integration is manual.
<p>From my perspective, all of the current API analytics stuff is born out of a very necessary, but technical, and boring IT realm. The experiences we are creating are very database, system, platform, app or resource directed experiences, with monetization in mind&mdash;all while trying to build the most meaningful app for end-users. We need to flip the paradigm, like we are seeing from API pioneers like Netflx, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/12/17/future-api-design-orchestration-layer/">who are talking about designing experience based API</a>s, instead of resource based APIs. In this way of thinking, the API is designed with the end-user experience in mind, and not blinded with where the resource came from, or how its structured&mdash;it is all based upon how it will actually be used.
<p>Think of what an &ldquo;experience&rdquo; based analytics approach could do for business models, rather than focusing on the few experiences we already know, like how to monetize with the page view, app session, ad view, and add click. We could start identifying much more meaningful experiences to end-users, and yes even experiences that people are willing to pay for&mdash;the monetized experience! <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a> will love that. Reducing everything to a transaction baby! Its my job.
<p>Well that concludes my analytics brain vomit for the day. I responded to my two emails, and had a fruitful call with a leading tech company about the future of analytics in the API stack, and successfully puked up this post. If you read it, I&rsquo;m very sorry, and I hope it made sense. I&rsquo;m still working through these thoughts, but it is a bucket that has been overflowing for a while now. I&rsquo;ll put on the side burner, stir my thoughts around in future stories, and figure out what is next.

        <span class="post-date">24 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://hall.com/docs/integrations"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/hall/hall-api-integrations.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>I saw two tweets from Zapier the other day, where they were highlighting two separate SaaS platforms, who had integrated Zapier into their own platform. Both <a href="https://help.gumroad.com/customer/portal/articles/1579321-integrations">Gumroad</a> and <a href="https://hall.com/docs/integrations">Hall</a> took the time to highlight the other platforms they are integrated with. I think there are a couple of interesting items in these stories&hellip;
<p><strong>Zapier &amp; IFTTT Integration</strong> <br /> A while back <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">I added reciprocity to this list</a> of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building blocks</a>, because I was seeing enough API providers, taking it upon themselves to make sure their platform had both Zapier and IFTTT integration. Ensuring your API is working with leading reciprocity providers will become even more critical for API providers, as more non-developers are putting APIs to work managing their daily personal, and professional lives.
<p><strong>Dedicated Integration Page</strong><br /> The fact that hall has a dedicated integration page is interesting. I think it is valuable to show the platforms that an API has been officially integrated with. It helps developers, and non-developers understand the potential that exists around a platform and its API. I can also see the benefit of opening up the ability for the API ecosystem to submit their own integrations as well--you never know it might encourage other platforms to integrate, if they know they have an opportunity to be showcased.
<p>I like how <a href="https://hall.com/docs/integrations">Hall does their integration page</a>, and they 15+ integrations, they have a custom option, which is basically their very simple API, allowing you to post messages from your app. Hall doesn&rsquo;t seem to have a full blown API, allowing you to interact with all aspects of the platform, but I still their approach is interesting.
<p>I think that integration with reciprocity providers like Zapier and IFTTT should be default for all API providers. I also think that API providers should consider highlighting other common platform integrations like with Heroku or Github, depending on the nature of your API. You can consider providing seamless integration between platforms, as well as what I&rsquo;d consider a platform development kit (PDK)&mdash;providing open source, white lable code that allows a developer to reverse engineer your integration with other leading platforms.
<p>As we spend more time in the clouds, I think providing seamless integration with other platforms, providing platform development kits (PDK), and employing reciprocity providers like Zapier and IFTTT will become the norm.

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m a little biased at the moment, after participating in a <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/07/22/reclaim-your-domain-la-hackathon-wrapup/">Reclaim Your Domain hackathon</a> with some really smart folks from multiple universities, as well as working on my first white paper on APIs in higher education, but I feel pretty strongly that higher education institutions focusing on APIs will extremely important in the next two years.
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly working to understand the big picture of the emerging API economy, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/24/the-importance-of-a-government-api-phase/">the importance of the government API development phase</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/what-is-next-for-the-us-government-api-strategy/">working to understand what is next for the US government API strategy</a>, while also <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/17/what-is-the-next-phase-of-apis/">acknowledging we need the enterprise to continue waking up to the potential of APIs</a>. I think, right along with government, and the enterprise, another importance piece of the overall API puzzle is increasing the focus on <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">APIs in higher education</a>.
<p><strong>The University Argument</strong><br /> If I am making a pitch to a university, I would <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">tell my Amazon API story</a>, and how APIs can open up access to institutional resources, making them more accessible across campus, and externally with partners and vendors. APIs are how startups, SMB, enterprise, and the government are increasing efficiency, agility, and delivering the web and mobile apps that are part of a larger, healthier digital strategy vision. Top universities like <a href="http://webservices.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>, <a href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>, and <a href="https://developer.byu.edu/wiki/dashboard.action">Brigham Young University</a> or leading the way with modern API platforms, that are changing the way they do business on campus&mdash;take a look at the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/23/browsing-the-261-apis-at-brigham-young-university/">250+ APIs from BYU</a>, to get a idea.
<p><strong>The Student Argument</strong><br /> If I am making the pitch for why students should care about APIs, during the most formative years of their lives, I would point out that APIs are already touching every aspect of their lives, from the websites they visit, to the mobile phone in their pocket. If your college years are about preparing you for the world, APIs need to front and center in your education, giving you the basics, but also allowing you to peel back the black curtain on the technology that is slowly taking over our world, and establish skills that will give you an edge in your career.
<p><strong>Web Literacy</strong><br /> Computers, and the Internet are part of the higher education experience, and it is increasingly important that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span></strong> students obtain at least a basic level of web literacy to be able to operate on the web. Understanding the workings of the Internet, like HTTP, SSL, URLs, DNS, Email, and fundamentals of privacy, security, and terms of service, are essential to the education of every individual. While they may not retain everything they learn, like the rest of their education, it will provide a fundamental base for them to work from the rest of their lives.
<p><strong>Domain Literacy</strong><br /> Students today are faced with understanding who they are in this big new world they are thrust into after being at home with their parents, and that includes understating and expanding their digital identity. What is the difference between university, commercial, and government web and mobile applications? Students need to have a sense of what is theirs, and what is a companies or institutions, and understand when some information or content is something they should personally own. Domain literacy is not just about learning about online domains like .com and .org, it is about understanding your own domain on social networks like Facebook and Twitter, or your student information system account, class forums, and the possibilities that are opened up when you are in control your own online domain.
<p><strong>Portfolio Ownership</strong><br /> Every classroom, project and program experience for a student should be considered a potential candidate for addition to a student's portfolio. Contributing to, and managing a portfolio in 2014 is done online, allowing for a portfolio to potentially be spread across campus, corporate and other 3rd party sites, platforms, and systems. Educating students about owning their own content, data and other information, and the opportunities around data portability and APIs, in helping them assert ownership and control over their portfolio is essential to education in the digital age. I'm not talking traditional e-portfolio, I'm talking about defining, understanding, and aggregating the best of what you do online, during your college years--in preparation for entering the real world.
<p><strong>Workplace Ready</strong><br /> Higher education is about preparing students for their role in society, and hopefully part of that is being a positive contributor to the workplace, and larger workforce. Modern web APIs are born out of the most tech savviest employees, developing the work-arounds, and access to resources they need to get their jobs done, and solve the problems they face. Whether it is pulling Census Bureau data, and populating a spreadsheet, or migrating the companies blog platform from blogger to a dedicated Wordpress instance, APIs are central to the skills that tomorrow's workforce will need. APIs aren&rsquo;t always about developing a website, or mobile application, they can be as simple as migrating form entries from an online form, and populating a Google Spreadsheet using <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>. If one of our goals is to make sure students are prepared for the workforce, APIs have to be a regular part of their educational diet, ensuring that when they hit the ground as part of the workforce, API literacy is default.
<p><strong>Digital Citizen</strong><br /> APIs are already touching every aspect of life from looking for a restaurant on Yelp, to paying your taxes using TurboTax. Not every individual needs to understand the inner workings of APIs and oAuth, but they <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/17/api-and-oauth-literacy-is-as-important-as-financial-literacy-in-the-api-economy/">need to have basic API literacy</a>, so they know APIs exist, and that they can get their photos and other information out of a service they use. Every citizen needs to understand the apps on their mobile phone, and the relationship to their online accounts, and who has access to their personal information using oAuth and APIs, and how they can manage these settings. To interact with government, APIs are playing an ever increasing role, and allowing citizens to participate in the political process, access student aid, pay their taxes, and get access to their energy and healthcare data. Let's prepare our students for the future.
<p>In a perfect world students need to be aware of APIs by the time they first set foot on campus. Ideally they are already exposed to them in their daily online interactions, or someday through the FAFSA process, but at the very least it should be up to the university to expose them to APIs when it comes to class registration, student information systems, or ideally as part of the <a href="http://umw.domains/">school&rsquo;s Domain of One&rsquo;s Own program</a>.
<p>My argument isn't just about colleges and universities getting on board with APIs across all of campus operations, this is about faculty and administrations becoming API literate, and exposing students to APIs as part of every interaction. You don't like the student information system or class schedule when you come in as freshman? Ok, make it better. Need a list of students for a class? Here is the Google Spreadsheet to class schedule API connector. Want to bring in your posts from Tumblr into the classroom? Use the Tumblr API to get your content out, and published where you want using Zapier. Let's teach them to solve the everyday problems they face, by applying technology in sensible ways.
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some amazing movement during my last four years of evangelizing APIs, across mutiple industries, and within city and federal government, just by educating a handful of energetic entrepreneurs and civic activists, turning on the API light--resulting in incremental change in the way companies do business, organizations and government operates. Imagine if we turned on a whole generation of citizens, helping them understand that this is the way business is done, and how personal, corporate, organizational, institutional resources are accessed, shared, and managed?
<p>Similar to my efforts on APIs in the federal government over the last two years, I&rsquo;m going to turn up the focus on APIs in higher education. By 2016, I want APIs to be ubiquitous at higher educational institutions around the globe.

        <span class="post-date">23 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://strongloop.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/strongloop/strongloop-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking through <a href="https://strongloop.com/strongblog/node-js-api-server-announcement/">the most recent API server release from StrongLoop</a>, and I can&rsquo;t help but see echoes of what I&rsquo;ve been researching, and covering across the <a href="http://kinlane.com/about/">API Evangelist network</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> has been front and center for years, but <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment</a> is something that is just now being productized, with a wealth of new service providers emerging to provide API deployment solutions that go beyond DIY frameworks, and enterprise API gateways.
<p>Let start with walking through their announcement of their StrongLoop API Server:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>LoopBack 2.0 </strong>- An open source framework for quickly creating APIs with Node, including the client SDKs.</li>
<li><strong>mobile Backend-as-a-Service -</strong> An mBaaS to provide mobile services like push, offline-sync, geopoint and social login either on-premise or in the cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Connectors -</strong> Connectivity for Node apps leveraging over ten supported data sources including Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB and SOAP.</li>
<li><strong>Controller - </strong>Automated DevOps for Node apps including profiling, clustering, process management and log management capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring - </strong>A hosted or on-premise graphical console for monitoring resource utilization, response times and function tracing with the ability to send metrics to existing monitoring tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as StrongLoop did in their release post, let&rsquo;s dive deeper into LoopBack 2.0, the <a href="https://github.com/strongloop">open source core</a> of StrongLoop, which they say "acts as a glue between apps or devices and data via APIs written in Node&rdquo;:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Studio - </strong>A graphical interface to complement the command-line tooling and assist developers in building Loopback models.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> and <a href="https://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> -</strong> The ability to script tasks, scaffold, and template applications and externalize their configurations for multiple environments.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS 4.0</a> - </strong>The latest update, for the well known Node.js package, bringing improvements by removing bundled middleware and refactoring them into maintainable modules, revamped router to remove confusion on HTTP verb usage and decoupling Connect, the HTTP framework of Node from the Express web framework. It is also the E in the MEAN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, Node.js).</li>
<li><strong>Project Structure -</strong> An expanded directory structure has been expanded to make it easier to organize apps and add functionality via pre-built LoopBack components and Node modules.</li>
<li><strong>Workspace API -</strong> Internal API making it easier to define, configure, and bootstrap your application at design time and runtime by simply defining metadata in the form of JSON.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is one of the few sophisticated, next generation, API deployment frameworks I have seen.  We have had gateways for a while, and we have a new breed of database and spreadsheet to API providers like <a href="https://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">APISpark</a>. We also have a new wave of <a href="http://scraping.apievangelist.com">scraping</a> to API solutions from <a href="https://bit.ly/1kNmUGe">Kimono Labs</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/1pKwOg9">Import.io</a>, but I&rsquo;d say <a href="https://bit.ly/1wWkDwH">Orchestrate.io</a> gets us closest to the vision I have for StrongLoop, when it comes to API deployment.
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/legos.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;ve referenced this ability in my stories on virtual API stacks:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">Virtualized API Stacks</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/01/traffic-and-weather--virtualized-api-stacks/">Traffic and Weather - Virtualized API Stacks</a></li>

<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/api-virtual-stack-composition-like-the-absolut-drinks-data-api/">Virtual Stack Composition Like The Absolut Drinks Data API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This new approach to API deployment allows us to rapidly define, deploy, and orchestrate stacks of API resources for use in our web, single page, and mobile applications. I really feel like <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">BaaS</a>, as an entire company, was just a short growth phase, that leading us to this point, where anyone can quickly deploy their own BaaS, for any broad, or niche purpose. I also see my research into the world of <a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/">APIs and Single Page Apps (SPAs)</a> reflected here, in StrongLoops API platform vision.
<p>I feel that StrongLoop has an important take on API deployment, one that reflects where leading API, web, single page, and mobile app developers have been for a while now. The difference is that StrongLoop is providing as a standardized platform, allowing developers to much more elegantly orchestrate their entire lifecycle. You have everything you need to connect to existing resources, generate new API resources, and organize work into reusable parts, to deliver the web, single page, mobile apps you need.
<p>I am closely watching this new generation of <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API deployment providers</a>, companies like StrongLoop, Orchestrate, Flynn, and Cosmic. I see these players being the next generation API gateway, that goes way beyond just providing an enterprise gateway to internal assets. This newer vision is much more directly aligned with the needs of developers, enabling them to rapidly design, deploy and manage the API services they need to drive the web, single page, and mobile apps that are the vehicles in the API economy.

<p>I spent the weekend hacking away with a small group of very smart folks, at the <a href="http://lahackathon.reclaimyourdomain.org/">Reclaim Your Domain Hackathon in Los Angeles</a>. Fifteen of us gathered at Pepperdine University in west LA, looking to move forward the discussion around what we call &ldquo;Reclaim Your Domain&rdquo;. This conversation began last year, at the <a href="http://bavatuesdays.com/reclaim-open-learning/">#ReclaimOpen Hackathon</a>, continued earlier this year at <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/05/01/exploring-the-domain-universe-at-emory-university/">Emory University</a>, and we were looking to keep the momentum building this weekend at Pepperdine.
<p>Here is a breakdown of who was present this weekend:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Jim Groom</strong> - University of Mary Washington (<a href="https://twitter.com/jimgroom">@jimgroom</a>)</li>

</ul>
<p>If you are unsure of what #Reclaim is all about, join the club, we are trying to define it as well. You can head over to <a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org/">Reclaim Your Domain</a>, or you can also look at <a href="http://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim Hosting</a>, and the original <a href="http://umw.domains/">Domain Of Ones Own at University of Mary Washington</a> which has provided much of the initial spark behind the #Reclaim movement, for more information. Ultimately, #Reclaim will always be a very personal experience for each individual, but Reclaim Your Domain is primarily about:&nbsp;
<blockquote><em>Educating, and empowering individual to define, reclaim, and manage their digital self</em></blockquote>
<p>The primary thing I got out of this weekend, beyond the opportunity to hang out with such a savvy group of educators, was the opportunity to talk through <a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/">my own personal #Reclaim process</a>, as well as my vision of how we can use <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/07/16/driving-the-reclaim-process-using-terms-of-service-didnt-read/">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read as a framework for the #Reclaim process</a>. The weekend&nbsp;re-enforced the importance of APIs in higher education, in not just my own API Evangelism work, but contributing to the overall health of the Internet (which I will talk about in a separate post).
<p>To recap what I said above, there are three domains, that you will need to learn about my current #Reclaim work:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org">Reclaim Your Domain</a></strong> - The project site for all of this work, where you will find links to all information, calendar of events, and link to individual reclaim sites.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/">Kin Lane Reclaim Your Domain</a></strong> - My personal #Reclaim website where I am working on reclaiming my domain, while I also work to define the overall process.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tosdr.org">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read</a></strong> - A website for establishing plain english, yet machine readable discussions around the terms of service for the platforms we depend on.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the weekend I was introduced to some other very import tools, which are essential to the #Reclaim process:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://withknown.com/">Known</a></strong> - A publishing platform that empowers you to manage your online self, available as an open source tool, or available as cloud service. I&rsquo;m still setting up my own instance of Known, and will have more information after I get setup, and play with more.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://indieauth.com/">IndieAuth</a></strong> - IndieAuth is a way to use your own domain name to sign in to websites, which is a missing piece on the identity front for #Reclaim. Same as Known, I&rsquo;ll have more information on this after I play with.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also got some quality time, getting more up to speed on two other of tools that will be be important to #Reclaim:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://fed.wiki.org/view/welcome-visitors">Smallest Federated Wiki</a></strong> - A simple, and powerful wiki implementation that uses the latest technology to collaborate around content, with a very interesting approach to using JSON, and plugins to significantly evolve the wiki experience.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim Hosting</a></strong> - Reclaim Hosting provides educators and institutions with an easy way to offer their students domains and web hosting that they own and control.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the course of two days I was able to share what I was working on, and learn about <a href="https://twitter.com/withknown">@withknown</a>, and what <a href="https://twitter.com/holden">@holden</a> is up to with Smallest Federated Wiki, and get a closer look at what <a href="https://twitter.com/timmmmyboy">@timmmmyboy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jimgroom">@jimgroom</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/">@mburtis</a> are up to with Reclaim Hosting, while also explore some other areas I think are vital to #Reclaim moving forward. #WIN There were also some other really important takeways for me.
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/reclaim-your-domain-la-hackathon/reclaim-hackathon.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p><strong>POSSEE</strong><br /><a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE"> POSSE</a> is an acronym for Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere. For the first time I saw an application that delivers on this concept, while also holding potential for the whole reclaim your domain philosophy--<a href="https://withknown.com/">Known</a>. I am excited to fire up my own instance of Known and see how I can actually use to manage my digital self, and add this slick piece of software to the #Reclaim stack of tools that everyone else can put to use.
<p><strong>The Importance of API 101</strong><br /> During the second day of the hackathon, I was asked to give an API 101 talk. I headed to the other end of the meeting area, allowing anyone who wasn&rsquo;t interested in listening to me, to continue hacking on their own. I was surprised to see that everyone joined me to learn about APIs--well everyone except <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a> (API blah blah blah). I felt like everyone had a general sense of what an API was, but only a handful of folks possessed intimate knowledge. I used the separation of websites being for humans, and APIs being for other applications and systems as the basis for my talk&mdash;showing how websites return HTML for displaying to humans, and APIs return JSON meant to be used by applications. Later in the day I also wrote a little PHP script which made a call to an API (well JSON file), then displayed bulleted list of results, to help show how APIs can drive website content. Once again I am reminded of the importance of API 101 demos, and how I need to focus more in this area.
<p><strong>The Importance of Github 101</strong><br /> One of the topics we covered was the basics of using Github. I walked through the basic concepts that surround Github usage like repositories, forks, commits, pull requests&mdash;demonstrating how multiple users can collaborate, and work together on not just code, but content. I demonstrated how issues, and milestones can also be used to manage conversation around the project, in addition to work with repository files. Lastly, I walked through Github Pages, and how using a separate branch, you can publish HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON for projects, turning Github into not just a code and content management platform, but also a publishing endpoint.
<p><strong>APIs.json Playing a Role in #Reclaim</strong><br /> After hearing <a href="https://twitter.com/timmmmyboy">@timmmmyboy</a> talk about how Reclaim Hosting aggregates domain users within each university, I brought up <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> and how I&rsquo;m using this as a index for APIs in both the public and private sector. While it may not be something that is in the immediate roadmap for #Reclaim, I think APIs.json will play a significant role in #Reclaim process down the road, and is worth noting here.
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/reclaim-your-domain-la-hackathon/kin-lan-reclaim-hackathon-la.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p><strong>Containerization Movement</strong><br /> One pattern I saw across the Reclaim Hosting and Domain of One&rsquo;s Own work from <a href="https://twitter.com/timmmmyboy">@timmmmyboy</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/jimgroom">@jimgroom</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/">@mburtis</a>, is that they are mimicking what is currently happening in the <a href="https://twitter.com/docker">@docker</a> dominated containerization movement we are seeing from tech leaders like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Red Hat. Then only difference is Reclaim Hosting is doing it as apps that can be deployed across a known set of domains, spanning physical servers, within a particular institution. Containers offer portability for the #Reclaim lifecycle, for when students leave institutions, as well as for the wider public space, when people are looking to #Reclaim their digital self.
<p><strong>Importance of APIs in Higher Ed</strong><br /> APIs are central to everything about #Reclaim. It is how users will take control over their digital self, driving solutions like Known. With #Reclaim being born, and propagated via universities, the API stakes are raised across higher education. Universities need to adopt an API way of life, to drive all aspects of campus operations, but also to expose all students to the concept of APIs, making part of the university experience--teaching students to #Reclaim their own course schedule, student data, and other portfolio, and other aspects of the campus experience. Universities are ground zero, when it comes to exposing the next generation of corporate employees, government workers, and #Reclaim informed citizens--we have a lot of work to do to get insitutions up to speed.
<p><strong>Evolving the Hackathon Format</strong><br /> The Reclaim Your Domain LA Hackathon has moved forward the hackathon definition for me. There were no applications built over the weekend, and there were no prizes given away to winners, but there was significant movement that will live beyond just this single event&mdash;something that the previous definition of hackathon didn&rsquo;t possess for me. Fifteen of us came together Friday night for food and drink at <a href="https://twitter.com/amichaelberman">@amichaelberman</a> house. Saturday morning we came together at Pepperdine and spent the day working through ideas and tool demonstrations, which included a lot of open discussion. Saturday night we came together at our house in Hermosa Beach, where we drank, continued conversations from the day, and Jazzercised on the roof until wee hours of the morning. Then Sunday we came together for breakfast, and went back to work at Pepperdine for the rest of the day. Once done, some folks headed to airport, and the rest of headed back to Hermosa Beach for dinner, more drinks, and conversation until late in the evening.
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/reclaim-your-domain-la-hackathon/reclaim-hackathon-beers.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>Over the two days, there was plenty of hacking, setting up Known and Smallest Federated Wiki, as part of Reclaim Your Domain. Most attendees got to work on their #Reclaim definitions, and POSSEE workflow using Known, and learned how to generate API keys, commit to Github, and other essential #Reclaim tasks. At many other hackathons I&rsquo;ve been to, there were tangible projects that came out of the event, but were always abandoned after the short weekend. #Reclaim didn&rsquo;t produce any single startup or application, but deployed and evolved on top of existing work, and processes, that will continue long after this single event, and will continue to build momentum with each event we do--capturing much more of the exhaust from a weekend hackathon.
<p><strong>The Time Is Right For #Reclaim</strong><br /> I feel #Reclaim is in motion, and there is no stopping it now. Each of the three events I&rsquo;ve done, have been extremely fruitful, and the ideas, conversation, and code just flows. I see signs across the Internet, that some people are beginning to care more about about their digital self, in light of exploitation from government, and technology companies. It is not an accident that this movement is coming out of higher education institutions, and will continue to spread, and build momentum at universities. The time is right for #Reclaim, I can feel it.

<p>In the API space it is easy to recognize the cool kids, the ones that are in the know. These types of personalities just understand how to get things done, don't take no for an answer, and understand the DIY, self-service nature of APIs.
<p>I get a lot of folks who ask me to add them to my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API Management provider section</a>, or my <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/">API Integration area</a>. I always add these people to my Evernote queue, and when I get time I go through and profile them, I add them to my master CRM, and when I publish the latest round of content and data to the <a href="http://kinlane.com/about/">API Evangelist network</a> site in question, the blog post, or company listing will be updated&mdash;something that can take minutes or weeks, depending on my workload.
<p>In contrast, the savvy people in the space, understand that the API Evangelist network runs on Github, as <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">60+ separate research projects</a>, and that they can add themselves. All you do is fork the project you want to update, add yourself to the blog post, or the JSON file that drives the data listing, and submit a pull request. I don&rsquo;t always guarantee I will accept your addition, but if it is correct, and brings value to the API community, there is a good chance I will.
<p>I just finished publishing a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/17/it-takes-a-team-of-evangelists-to-raise-an-api/">list of all of the SendGrid developer evangelists</a>, and I mistakenly left off Will Smidlein (<a href="https://twitter.com/ws">@ws</a>), one of the SendGrid developer evangelists. Will, being one of the cool kids, didn&rsquo;t ask, he just forked API Evangelist, added himself to the list, and submitted a pull request. Minutes later, he&rsquo;s on the blog, listed correctly as one of the evangelist.
<p>I wonder how long it will take for more of my audience to realize they can help curate, and publish to API Evangelist, right alongside me--it has been this way since January of 2013. ;-)

        <span class="post-date">17 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-key.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;m loving about where the API space is going, is the simplicity, and remixability of available API resources, when they are defined with machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a>.  An example of this, can be found in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">my recent work to make federal government APIs more discoverable</a>.
<p>I generated machine readable API definitions using Swagger, for four separate APIs out of the GSA. The APIs were spread across two separate domains:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usa.gov.apievangelist.com/">usa.gov</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="http://explore.data.gov.apievangelist.com/">explore.data.gov</a>. You can follow the details of research, at each of the project repositories, but as I continue with my work, I keep thinking about the power that having a machine readable definition for all four of these APIs, and my ability to now remix these simple, and powerful API resources into <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/api-virtual-stack-composition-like-the-absolut-drinks-data-api/">virtual stacks</a>. After I work my way through the 120 government APIs I have targeted, I will have an amazing index of government API resources to compose from.
<p>My vision around all of this goes beyond just <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a>, and finding government APIs. I want to make it so we can compose virtual stacks of API resources, that can be used in different scenarios. If you are building a public engagement app for an election, you can assemble exactly the API resources your developers will need, aggregate them using their API definition, into a single developer area&mdash;even though the APIs may span multiple federal agency developer areas.
<p>In this scenario, developers don't have to go find all the API resources they need, an architect, or API lead can aggregate everything into a one-stop-shop for what the developers will need. This evolution in API delivery makes me very happy, right up until I come up against the current state of on-boarding with APIs, to get the credentials you need to use the API resource. In this particular scenario, you would have to sign up for an account with 10 or 20 separate agencies, or outside groups&mdash;stripping away any benefits gained through the remixing and aggregation of APIs.
<p>How do we solve API consumer access for the API economy? I know that API providers like Mashape, and Mashery have tried to solve with their platforms. These touch on the problem, but are providing very siloed solutions--I feel we need one that works for API consumers who are using many APIs, across many providers, in an adhoc manner. As a lead architect for a mobile project, I shouldn't have to spend hours signing up my application across many different API consumer accounts.
<p>As part of the <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json specification</a>, we encourage API providers to include a link to their signup page, but this is just a link. Eventually we need a machine readable API registration flow, where trusted developers can ping, receive authentication instructions, and easily obtain keys to use an API resource. I&rsquo;m sure there are legacy SOA scenarios my readers will school me on, and I&rsquo;m hoping to also learn about any existing standards available that address this. My motivation here, is to push my understanding of what is available, and hopefully jump start a conversation with API providers, about any viable solutions to authenticating across multiple APIs as seamlessly as possible, when you are developing distributed apps.

<p>There are a lot of lessons to be learned from the leaders of the API space, pioneers like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> and <a href="http://sendgrid.com/team">SendGrid</a>, when it comes to running our own API programs. Fortunately for the community, most of the leading API providers are willing to share their experience and wisdom with us, such as SendGrid, with their latest series<a href="http://sendgrid.com/blog/tips-tricks-beginner-developer-evangelist-part-2/"> Tips and Tricks for a Beginner Developer Evangelist</a>.
<p>The blog series delivers some great API evangelism wisdom, from the mouths of evangelists, who are in the trenches, getting the word out about the email API platform, and supporting its large ecosystem of application developers. I'll let you read the tips from the SendGrid team, what I thought was interesting, was the makeup of their evangelist team.
<p>You have two managers leading the charge:

<p>You can check out their full team <a href="http://sendgrid.com/developers#the-team">here</a>.
<p>I think the blog series from SendGrid is a look into, what it takes to run a successful API evangelism campaign. I&rsquo;ve had multiple conversations in the last couple days with API providers who are just now beginning to build their API teams, and were looking for on advice on who to hire, and how to grow and train their evangelists.
<p>To anyone who is just now constructing their API team, follow the SendGrid <a href="http://sendgrid.com/blog/">blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SendGrid">Twitter accoun</a>t, then follow each of the SendGrid evangelist team on Twitter&mdash;they produce a lot of great content, that will help you understand what API evangelism success will look like. You can also follow the lead of Tim and Brandon, in how they have developed the team of evangelists, and the amount of resources they are investing in the success of the SendGrid API.
<p>There is not a single API program I know of that is doing evangelism perfectly, but when you pay attention to the leading providers, there are endless things you can pick up, by watching them in action&mdash;both good and bad.
<p><strong>P.S. </strong>- Every API provider should consider diversity diversity when organizing their teams.

        <span class="post-date">16 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://tosdr.org/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/terms-of-service-didnt-read/tos-didnt-read-logo.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been fascinated by the <a href="https://tosdr.org/index.html">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read</a> project. i&rsquo;m on the mailing list, and try to make time to stay in tune, but have yet to ever contribute any bandwidth to the EXTREMELY important project, around making sense of the crazy terms of services (TOS), that we agree to in our daily lives.
<p>I finally found myself at a point where I'm forced to start paying more attention to API terms of service, and hopefully will be able to slice off a little bit of dedicated bandwidth to Terms of Service; Didn&rsquo;t Read. I have two projects that have floated up on my list, and deserve some priority attention.
<p>First I&rsquo;m applying the TOS Didn't Read work to a side project of mine called <a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org/">Reclaim Your Domain</a>, which is a project to help me define my digital self, and reclaim some of the content, data and other value I generate on a daily basis online. I&rsquo;m hoping TOS Didn't Read will provide a machine readable moral backbone to the #Reclaim process&mdash;which is a work in progress.
<p>Second, I&rsquo;m looking to build on the TOS Didn't Read work, and apply further to the world of APIs, by defining another one of the machine readable <a href="http://apisjson.org">API.json</a> properties. The first of which are machine readable properties like API Blueprint, RAML, and Swagger API definitions, and the <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> manifest, which allows you to reference the copyright for a specific API interface.
<p>I want to build on the work TOS Didn&rsquo;t Read has done, apply their tracking and ranking system of online services, to the APIs that I monitor. Using APIs.json I want to encourage API providers to publish this machine readable index of their available APIs, allowing them to be indexed by API search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. Then, as part of each APIs.json I want to help API providers understand the benefits of machine readable API definitions, API copyright declarations, and API terms of service (TOS). I know, that is a pretty tall order, but I think it can be done.
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>TOS Didn't Read provides me with a wealth of topics, and detailed points to apply when evaluating API provider&rsquo;s terms of service&mdash;which is an excellent foundation to build on top of. I've forked the <a href="https://github.com/tosdr/tosdr.org">TOS Didn't Read repository</a>, as part of the APIs.json organization, and will be establishing a supporting project for defining what a machine readable terms of service file might look like. I think I will call this project Terms of Service; Machine Readable, or TOS;MR.
<p>My goal is to provide a meaningful list of questions (TOS;DR topics &amp; points), that we can use to quantify API providers. I want to enable API providers to answer these questions, and publish a machine readable list of relevant topics somewhere in their domain, and include as a property in their APIs.json file.
<p>Ok, I have a lot of work. Luckily I'm not entirely re-inventing the wheel here. I&rsquo;m building on the existing work of TOS Didn't read, but applying specifically to APIs, and connecting it to my existing API discovery work with APIs.json.

        <span class="post-date">16 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/zapier-google-docs-api-spark.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;m exploring different ways that APIs can be deployed, with an emphasis on deployment by non-developers. There are numerous cloud services available, that allow non-developers to execute common business tasks like registration forms, <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/surveymonkey/google-docs/18382/surveymonkey-new-response-to-google-docs-create-spreadsheet-row/">surveys</a>, payments, and product sales, and when you combine these business functions with <a href="https://zapier.com/app/dashboard">Zapier</a>, Google Docs and <a href="https://apispark.com/">APISpark</a>&mdash;you can deploy an API, no code skills required.
<p>This story begins with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/30/deploy-an-api-from-a-google-spreadsheet-using-apispark/">ability to deploy an API from any Google Spreadsheet using APISpark</a>, putting API deployment within the grasp of the average business user. Next, I want the easiest possible way to get data, from multiple sources, into a Google Spreadsheet? Answer: <a href="https://zapier.com/app/dashboard">Zapier</a> (or <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">other reciprocity provider</a>, like <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>). &nbsp;To support this, I started looking through the numerous Zapier recipes, that allow my me to publish results to a Google Spreadsheet&mdash;there are 167!
<p>The most obvious <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/twitter/google-docs/4396/add-tweets-to-google-docs-row/">data source I see is Twitter</a>. Everyone time there is a Tweet from specific user, or from a specific Twitter search, you can have it published to a Google Spreadsheet, and when you have that spreadsheet connected to an APISpark API, the results will be automatically available via API.
<p>The second most common source of data I see, would be cloud based forms. I see providers like <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/wufoo/google-docs/4905/save-wufoo-entry-to-google-docs-row/">Wufoo</a>, <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/gravity-forms/google-docs/16647/save-gravity-forms-submission-to-google-spreadsheet/">Gravity Forms</a>, and <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/jotform/google-docs/3379/add-jotform-submission-to-google-docs-row/">JotForm</a>, to name a few, that allow you to submit form submissions to any Google Spreadsheet, and with the APISpark integration, all your form submissions are automatically available via API.
<p>After that, I see numerous <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/woocommerce/google-docs/23762/woocommerce-new-order-to-google-docs-create-spreadsheet-row/">commerce</a>, <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/paypal/google-docs/1421/add-paypal-sales-google-docs-spreadsheet-row/">payment</a>s, and other key business functions, that Zapier enables publishing of data and content into a Google Spreadsheet from. All of these services have APIs, that is why Zapier is able to do what they do, but that would require a developer to tackle with custom API integration (not for this story). This story is all about enabling non-developers to deploy APIs, from common business functions, no coding necessary--Zapier is our middleman.
<p>Beyond Twitter, forms, payments, and product sales, I will explore other easy to implement, API deployment using Zapier, Google Docs, and APISpark. These represent API deployment scenarios I don't think people are tracking on, and with a little education, I think we can bring problem owners up to speed, and increase the number of APIs available, driven by average person, and the common business problems they face every day.

<p>To top it off, <a href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards">the API Standards is hosted on Github</a>, in its own repository, and as Gray Brooks from 18F says:

<p>Simple guidance like this goes a long way in helping, sometimes even very experienced developers, understand the best practices when it comes to designing, simple, modern APIs&mdash;a world where consistency and simplicity goes a long way!

<p>I was looking through <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/looking-at-77-federal-government-api-developer-portals-and-190-apis">federal government APIs</a> the other day, looking for the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government">low hanging fruit</a>, when it came to making government APIs more discoverable using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. During my initial work, I played with <a href="http://www.usa.gov.apievangelist.com/">three separate APIs from www.usa.gov</a>, which I think demonstrates the importance of CORS, and how opening it up for APIs, makes them more portable and remix-able.
<p>When it comes to the the three APIs from www.usa.gov, I do not have control over the API itself, but I wanted to create a self contained, site that showcased the government APIs, and provide interactive API documentation generated using Swagger. I made sure all three of the APIs had machine readable API definitions using Swagger, then I setup a simple HTML page, which allowed anyone to play with each of the APIs.
<p>This worked great until I reached the third API, which was at a different domain than the previous two, and didn't have CORS enabled. If you aren't familiar with CORS, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)</a>, which is a mechanism that allows many resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain the resource originated from&mdash;behavior that you may want to control on a web page, but for an API it is something you want to encourage.
<p>CORS being enabled, is the difference between an API being portable, and remix-able, and it being locked down to its original developer portal. If an API is RESTful and has CORS enabled, any outside party (like me), can generate a machine readable API definitions for it, and compose a developer experience, that that includes the API&mdash;with or without consent of the original API provider. While this might scare the shit out of some API providers, it is the future of API driven, application architecture.
<p>You can't expect all developers to find your API developer portal, and APIs need to be more portable, allowing for remixing by other API providers, backend as a service providers, and anyone who wants to feature the API resource in their developer portal. CORS is a simple thing that you can enable for your APIs that will make a big difference in how your API is found, and integrated into other applications and systems.<p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

        <p><a href="https://www.commerce.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/digital-strategy/logos/commerce.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>
<p>Today, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker (<a href="https://twitter.com/PennyPritzker">@PennyPritzker</a>), <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/blog/2014/07/15/secretary-pritzker-discusses-power-government-data-and-announces-department-commerce">announced that the Department of Commerce will hire its first-ever Chief Data Officer</a>. I wanted to make sure that when this new, and extremely important individual assumes their role, they have my latest thoughts on how to make the Department of Commerce developer portal the best it possibly can be, because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this port will be</span> the driving force behind the rapidly expanding API driven economy.
<p>Secretary Pritzker does a pretty good job of summing up the scope of resources that are available at Commerce:
<blockquote><em>Secretary Pritzker described how the Department of Commerce&rsquo;s data collection &ndash; which literally reaches from the depths of the ocean to the surface of the sun &ndash; not only informs trillions of dollars of private and public investments each year and plants the seeds of economic growth, but also saves lives.</em></blockquote>
<p>I think she also does a fine job of describing the urgency behind making sure Commerce resources are available:
<blockquote><em>Because of Commerce Department data, Secretary Pritzker explained, communities vulnerable to tornadoes have seen warning times triple and tornado warning accuracy double over the past 25 years, giving residents greater time to search for shelter in the event of an emergency.</em></blockquote>
<p>To understand the importance of content, data and other resources that are coming out the Department of Commerce, you just have to look at the list of agencies that are underneath Commerce, who already have API initiatives:
<p><a href="https://www.usa.gov/directory/federal/department-of-commerce.shtml"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/matrix-dollar-sign.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>

<p>Then take a look at the other half, who have not launched APIs:

</ul>
<p>The data and other resources available through these agencies, underneath the Department of Commerce, reflect the heart of not just the U.S. economy, but the global economy, which is rapidly being driven by APIs, which are powering stock markets, finance, payment providers, cloud computing, and many other cornerstones of our increasingly online economy.
<p>Look through those 13 agencies, the resource they manage are all vital to all aspects of the economy telecommunications, patents, weather, oceans, census, to other areas that have a direct influence on how markets work, or don't work.
<p>I&rsquo;m all behind the Department of Commerce, hiring a Chief Data Officer (CDO), but my first question is, what will this person do?&nbsp;
<blockquote><em>This leader, Secretary Pritzker explained, will oversee improvements to data collection and dissemination in order to ensure that Commerce&rsquo;s data programs are coordinated, comprehensive, and strategic.</em></blockquote>
<p>Yes! I can get behind this. In my opinion, in order for the new CDO to do this, they will have to quickly bring all of the agencies /developer program up to a modern level of operation. There is a lot of work to be done, so let's get to work exploring what needs to happen.&nbsp;
<p><strong>A Central Department of Commerce Developer Portal To Rule Them All</strong><br /> Right now the <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/developer">Department of Commerce developer portal</a> at commerce.gov/developer, is just a landing page. An after thought, to help you find some APIs--not a portal. The new CDO needs to establish this real estate as the one true portal, which provides the resources other agencies will need for success, while also providing a modern, leading location for developers of web, mobile, Internet of things applications, and data journalists, or analyst to come to find the data they need. If you need a reference point, go look at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>, <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/">SalesForce</a>, <a href="https://go.developer.ebay.com/">eBay</a> or <a href="https://developers.google.com/">Googe&rsquo;s</a> developers areas&mdash;you should see this type of activity at commerce.gov/developer.
<p><strong>Each Agency Must Have Own Kick Ass Developer Portal</strong><br /> Following patterns set forth by their parent, Department of Commerce portal, each agency underneath needs to posses their own, best of breed developer portal, providing the data, APIs, code, and other resources, that public and private sector consumers will need.  I just finished <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/looking-at-77-federal-government-api-developer-portals-and-190-apis/">looking through all the available developer portals for commerce agencies</a>, and their is no consistency between them in user experience (UX), API design, or resources available. The new CDO will have to immediately get to work on taking existing patterns from the private sector, <a href="https://github.com/18F/API-All-the-X">as well as what has been developed by 18F</a>, and set a establish common patterns that other agencies can follow when designing, developing and managing their own agencies developer portal.
<p><strong>High Quality, Machine Readable Open Data By Default</strong><br /> The new CDO needs to quickly build on existing data inventory efforts that has been going on at Commerce, making sure any existing projects, are producing machine readable data by default, making sure all data inventory is available within their agency's portal, as well as at data.gov. This will not be a one time effort, the new CDO needs to make sure all program and project managers, also get the data steward training they will need, to ensure that all future work at the Department of Commerce, associated agencies, and private sector partners produces high quality, machine readable data by default.
<p><strong>Open Source Tooling To Support The Public And Private Sector</strong><br /> Within each of the Commerce, and associate agency developer portals, there needs to be a wealth of open source code samples, libraries and SDKs for working with data and APIs. This open source philosophy, also needs to be applied to any web or mobile applications, analysis or visualization that are part of Commerce funded projects and programs, whether they are from the public or private sector. All software developed around Commerce data, and receive public fundeing should be open source by default, allowing the rest of the developer ecosystem, and ultimately the wider economy to benefit and build on top of existing work.
<p><strong>Machine Readable API Definitions For All Resources</strong><br /> This is an area, that is a little bit leading edge, even for the private sector, but is rapidly emerging to play a central role in how APIs are designed, deployed, managed, discovered, tested, monitored, and ultimately integrated into other systems and applications. Machine readable <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/15/an-api-definition-as-the-truth-in-the-api-contract/">API definitions are being used as a sort of central truth</a>, defining how and what an API does, in a machine readable, but common format, that any developer, and potentially other system can understand. Commerce needs to ensure that all existing, as well as future APIs developed around Commerce data, possess a machine readable API definition, which will allow for all data resources to be plug and play in the API economy.
<p><a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/18f/18F_logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p><strong>Established An Assortment Of Blueprints For Other Agencies To Follow</strong><br /> The new Commerce CDO will have to be extremely efficient at establishing successful patterns that other agencies, projects and programs can follow. This starts with developer portal blueprints they can follow when designing, deploying and managing their own developer programs, but should not stop there, and Commerce will need a wealth of blueprints for open source software, APIs, system connectors, and much, much more.  Establishing common blueprints, and sharing these widely across government will be critical for consistency and interoperability--reducing the chances that agencies, or private sector partners will be re-inventing the wheel, while also reducing development costs.
<p><strong>Establish Trusted Partner Access For Public And Private Sector</strong><br /> Open data and APIs, do not always mean publicly available by default. Private sector API leaders have developed trusted partner layers to their open data and API developer ecosystems, allowing for select, trusted partners greater access to resources. An existing model for this in the federal government, is within the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint">IRS modernized e-file ecosystem</a>, and the trusted relationships they have with private sector tax preparation partners like H&amp;R Block or Jackson Hewitt. Trusted partners will be critical in Department of Commerce operations, acting as private sector connectors to the API economy,  enabling higher levels of access from the private sector, but in a secure and controlled way that protects the public interest.
<p><strong>Army of Domain Expert Evangelists Providing A Human Face</strong><br /> As the name says, Commerce spans all business sectors, and to properly "oversee improvements to data collection and dissemination in order to ensure that Commerce&rsquo;s data programs are coordinated, comprehensive, and strategic&rdquo;, the CDO will need another human layer to help increase awareness of Commerce data and APIs, while also supporting existing partners and integrators. An army of evangelists will be needed, possessing some extremely important domain expertise, across all business sectors, that Department of Commerce data and resources will touch. Evangelism is the essential human variable, that makes the whole open data and API algorithm work, the new CDO needs to get to work writing a job description, and hiring for this army&mdash;you will need an 18F, but one that is dedicated to the Department of Commerce.
<p><strong>Department of Commerce As The Portal At The Center Of The API Economy</strong><br /> The establishment of CDO at the Department of Commerce is very serious business, and is a role that will be central to how the global economy evolves in the coming years. The content, data, and digital resources that should, and will be made available at commerce.gov/developer and associated agencies, will be central to the health of the API driven economy.
<p>Think of what major seaports have done for the the economy over the last 1000 years, and what role Wall Street has played in the economy over the last century&mdash;this is the scope of the commerce.gov/developer portal, which is ultimately the responsibility of the new Department of Commerce Chief Data Officer.
<p>When the new CDO get started at the Department of Commerce, <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">I hope they reach out to 18F</a>, who will have much of what you need to get going. Then sit down, read this post, as well my other one on, <a href="http://govfresh.com/2014/01/next-us-government-api-strategy/">An API strategy for the U.S. government</a>, and once you get going, if you need any help, just let me know&mdash;as my readers know, I&rsquo;m full of a lot of ideas on APIs.

<p>One conversation I had at #Gluecon this year,  was around the role an API plays in being a contract between providers and consumers, with Tony Tam (<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>) from <a href="https://helloreverb.com/">Reverb</a>. API contract, is a common phrase to describe how API services are consumed, and depending on the on-boarding process, an API provider and consumer can enter into a contract for services around a set of resources, in a self-service way.
<p>In the last couple years, with the increased use of API definition formats like API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML, we often reference this API definition as a tangible representation of the contract API providers and consumers enter into. In my mind, I see the API definition as one building block, in a larger set of building blocks, that are working together to form a contract, with the API definition acting as the truth.
<p>If you step back and look across multiple API providers, you start to see a variety of building blocks that contribute to the overall "API Contract", that is negotiated between API provider and consumer, starting with the API definition.
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br /> A machine readable definition of an API interface, using a common format like API Blueprint, Swagger or RAML, providing a definition of the surface area of the resources that are available via API. API definitions are proving to be very useful in establishing a common way to describe, communicate and collaborate around APIs, which are often extremely abstract.
<p><strong>Terms of Service</strong><br /> Terms of service are the legal portion of the API contract, determining how the service can be used, keeping the company&rsquo;s interest in mind, but should also be liberal enough to allow developers and 3rd party integrators to be successful. Plain english version of terms of service go a long way in seamlessly fitting into the API contract, allowing API consumers to quickly understand where they stand.
<p><strong>Privacy</strong><br /> The privacy of a platform, is definitely a very critical element of the API contract, and sets the tone for a platform operations, contract with developers, and their promise to the end-users. An awareness, and respect of privacy issues is part of every success API platform, and feeds into the overall health of the contractrual relationship.
<p><strong>Service Level Agreement</strong><br /> A service level agreement (SLA), sets the quality of service expectations within the API contract. All API consumers should have some sort of SLA that provides a definition of the services being offered, and the level of service, and the reliability end-users can expect as part of API consumption.
<p><strong>Service Accord</strong><br /> As an API provider, if you can&rsquo;t offer a formal SLA, you should at least provide a service accord with users, setting expectations around what level of service will be offered around an API, and while a service accord isn&rsquo;t legally binding, it can at least help set expectations, and the tone of API operations for consumers.
<p><strong>Interface License</strong><br /> The Oracle v Google legal battle has brought API licensing front and center, making them part of the overall contract of API operations. Whether you apply copyright, or some other license, an API license will be part of the contract entered into between API provider and consumer.
<p><strong>Data License</strong><br /> Like an API interface, the licensing of underlying data stored, and returned by an API needs to have a license defined, providing guidance for developers, and businesses that are consuming an APIs data, and how they can store, remix, and put data to use.
<p><strong>Code License</strong><br /> Providing code in the form of samples, libraries, and SDKs is common practice for API providers, and the how the code is licensed will determine how API consumers integrate an API into their, providing another layer of licensing within the API contract. This doesn't end with client side code, many APIs will also offer server side API implementations, which should also be appropriately licensed.
<p><strong>Deprecation Policy</strong><br /> How long can API consumers depend on an API? What sort of notification will I get before an API is deprecated? The deprecation policies of an API, play a significant role in the trust established as part of the API contract that API providers and consumers agree to.
<p><strong>Roadmap</strong><br /> Contracts are know for targeting a specific period of time, but API contracts are considered to be open ended, and part of that obligation is communication and openness around an APIs roadmap, providing critical details on what is next for an API, allowing API consumers to trust that a contract will not change to quickly.
<p><strong>Changelog</strong><br /> Providing a place where API consumers can see a recent history of changes to an API platform offers a reference, for how often an API changes, and how its evolved over time, balancing out marketing and potential rhetoric around API operations.
<p><strong>Rate Limits</strong><br /> As an API consumer, if we are entering into a contract, I need to know how my contract will scale, and where I exist in the API supply chain. Rate limits provide a unit of measurement that can be used as part of the API contract, quantifying expectations and deliverables.
<p><strong>Uptime / Availability</strong><br /> You can offer a low cost, high value API service, but if your availability and uptime sucks, you are not delivering on the contract entered into with API consumers, making this aspect of operations a very important piece of the API contract.
<p><strong>Pricing</strong><br /> Stipulating the price paid for a service is fundamental to any contract, and the pricing of a particular API represents the value that is exchanged between API provider and consumer, as part of the API contract.
<p><strong>Service Tiers</strong><br /> Most modern APIs have multiple access levels, providing contract negotiation opportunities between API provider and consumer, a feature that allows API contracts to be negotiated, or re-negotiated in real-time, based upon known service tiers.
<p><strong>Support</strong><br /> A contract is a relationship between two businesses, and any relationship requires support to be successful. Direct, and indirect API support provides assurances to API consumers that once they enter into a contract, the API provider will be there to help in all phases of contract execution.
<p>An API definition provides a tangible, machine readable lens to look at the API contract through, providing a quantifiable truth that describes how an API will be delivered, but the actual API contract requires a suite of other supporting elements, starting with terms of service, and continuing through to how a company supports an API, before the API contract is fully realized.
<p>I'm very optimistic about the evolution of API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a> in 2014, now that we have the ability to define an API, and quantify the resources interface in a machine readable format. Next we need the same for the other portions of the "API contract", so that we can negotiate contracts for online resources in an automated, frictionless, real-time way.

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-telescope.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" />
<p>It is a pretty basic concept&mdash;look at other competing or complimentary APIs in the space, before designing your own. This seems like common sense to me, but I look at APIs for a living, and I&rsquo;m interested in finding the best API patterns across business or government sectors. Even though this topic seems like a no-brainer to me, I still encounter many folks who contact me to discuss their API strategy, but have not looked at any APIs, in the same genre as the one they are looking to enter--which tells me I should be writing about this topic on a regular basis.
<p>My first advice to any API provider, looking to begin new API effort, is to&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/08/thirty-apis-to-look-at-when-planning-your-api/">look at as many of the leading APIs out there</a>, as you have time for. Even if they aren&rsquo;t in the same genre as your API, they are leaders for a reason, and do many things that you can learn from. If nothing else, at least look at the pioneers like SalesForce, Amazon, Twitter and Google&mdash;they know what they are doing.
<p>Secondarily I urge developers to go look at any APIs that are doing the same thing, or portentially exist in the same genre, as your API. If you are doing a bookmark API, go look at Delicious and Pinboard. If you are doing an image API go look at Flickr and Instagram. Even if your API will be slightly different, you should look at all, accessible, patterns, that are similar to what you are trying to do do. Try to understand why these APis providers designed their interface the way they did, and actually make calls against the API, to see what you like, and what you don&rsquo;t like about their approach.
<p>Once you have looked at all the APIs you can, take the best patterns you found, and make it into your own. Even if you come back around, and still think your API design is superior, you will have learned something through the process&mdash;even if you learn what you don&rsquo;t want to do, or just receive validation of your idea.  If you haven&rsquo;t done your due diligence, looking for other healthy API patterns in the space, you are wasting valuable development cycles, on something that may not actually be innovating, and moving the conversation forward.

<p>In the API section, they provide a nice introduction to what is an API, and why you would use an API, including nine library focused APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://copac.ac.uk/developers/webapi/">copac</a></strong> - search over 70 UK and irish academic national &amp; specialist library catalogues</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.culturegrid.org.uk/use/">culture grid</a> -</strong> provides uk library listings, searchable by location, authority, region - and also lists associated collections</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://pro.europeana.eu/api">europeana</a> -</strong> an interface giving full and searchable remote access to all of the Europeana collection data</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/access/data/opensearch">european library api v2.0 </a>-</strong> data describing the collections and catalogues of national and research libraries in 48 countries</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.google.com/books/">google books family</a> -</strong> APIs to integrate with google data on books such as searching via title and retrieving data such as isbn and cover images</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/developers/documentation/api-references/opensearch-api/">nature.com website data</a> - </strong>bibliographic search for content on nature.com: news, research articles and citations</li>
<a href="https://www.nature.com/developers/documentation/api-references/opensearch-api/"> </a>
<li><a href="https://www.nature.com/developers/documentation/api-references/opensearch-api/"></a><strong><a href="/admin/blog/">oclc worldcat search</a> -</strong> provides catalogue search facilities across all participating libraries (worldwide). also search for libraries by location</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://openlibrary.org/developers/api">open library</a> -</strong> one web page for every book. open library exposes an API to gain access to all their book data in various formats</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/access/data/lod">rluk linked open data</a> -</strong> not really an API, but research libraries uk have published nearly 20 million bibliographic records from 34 libraries as linked open data</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.librarieshacked.org/">Libraries Hacked</a> is available as a Github, so any librarian, can fork, and launch for their own purposes, with everything licensed CC-BY.  I think that librarians hold the key to our future, and ensuring librarians have the latest resources they need when it comes to APIs, open data, and open source software is critical to all of this working.
<p>Sites like Libraries Hacked, not only save me a lot of time in researching priority areas like libraries, but also make me hopeful for the future, in a world where I&rsquo;m bombarded by warning signs around how technology is used, and knowing that librarians are getting equipped, makes me feel a lot better for all us.
<p><em><strong>P.S.</strong> I also love it when people use icons. I think I have an icon problem.</em>

        <span class="post-date">14 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.yodlee.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/yodlee/yodlee-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I spoke with the leading financial data API aggregation providers&nbsp;<a href="http://www.yodlee.com/">Yodlee</a> last week, regarding their <a href="http://www.yodlee.com/about-us/careers/">hunt for a director of developer evangelism</a>.  Yodlee provides an aggregation API that is designed for developers who need secure access to their users&rsquo; bank, credit card, investment, and loan accounts&mdash;if you think about it, this is a pretty critical API, in what we are all calling the &ldquo;API Economy&rdquo;.
<p>Yodlee isn&rsquo;t just looking for a junior evangelist, they are looking for a director&mdash;someone to lead the charge, when it comes to evangelizing Yodlee to potential API consumers, while also supporting the community and applications that are already integrated with the financial data aggregation platform. While there are well published job descriptions for the API evangelist role, there are no universities training up, cranking out the next generation of evangelism leaders&mdash;they are a unique breed, leaving a major hurdle for API providers like Yodlee to jump.
<p>Evangelists are equal parts engineer, business development, product development, sales, and marketing&mdash;a combination that is not easy to find. Yodlee and I discussed the difficulties of finding the right candidates for the role, and whether or not you emphasize the technical or the marketing skills? There are extremely few candidates who know they are evangelist material, you often have to sculpt one out of many different personality traits, and both technical and business skils.
<p>Evangelism talent, at both junior, and leadership levels is going to continue to be a major stumbling block for the expanding API economy. Even with some movement in the world of API discovery in 2014, we will never be able to fully automate API discovery, let alone evangelism, management and support. At some point we are going to need more agencies, and institutions focusing on training up the next generation of evangelists, similar to social media marketing did in the last 5 years&mdash;of course, hopefully we can scale a little more sensibly, than the social media marketing world did.
<p>If you are interested in the developer evangelist position at Yodlee, <a href="http://www.rockitrecruiting.com/jobs.php?cjobid=JB197383618">head over to the recruiters site</a>, and let them know I sent you.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/07/14/autodevbot-open-sources-their-api-monitor/">AutoDevBot Open Sources Their API Monitor</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">14 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://autodevbot.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/autodevbot/autodevbot-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://autodevbot.com/">API monitoring service AutoDevot</a> has opened sourced their JavaScript API monitoring solution, built on Frisby.js, called <a href="https://github.com/AutoDevBot/API-Monitor-Runner">API Monitor Runner</a>. The API monitoring tool, allows for a pretty robust configuration file, that lets you detail exactly what the service should monitor, and how it should behave when something out of the ordinary happens.
<p>I though the trigger actions stood out, allowing you to take common actions when something occurs with an API:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>TRIGGER_EMAIL</strong> - enable email notification</li>
<li><strong>TRIGGER_PAGER_DUTY</strong> - enable PagerDuty notification</li>
<li><strong>TRIGGER_WEBHOOK</strong> - enable a generic webhook notification</li>
<li><strong>TRIGGER_HIPCHAT</strong>- enable HipChat notification</li>
</ul>
<p>AutoDevBot, even takes things to another level, providing a ready to go Docker container, to quickly deploy API Monitor Runner, and then configure it on setup, using Docker environment params--a very interesting approach to deploying open tooling to support APIs.
<p>I really like this type of deployment for vital API services, focusing on providing a simple, valuable, cloud-based service, as well as an open source version that anyone can put to use. We just saw the same moves from <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/18/apitools-raises-the-bar-with-open-onpremise-api-testing-and-monitoring-tools/">3Scale with the release of APITools</a>, and now AutoDevBot with API Monitor Runner.
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see other critical building blocks of the API economy emulate this approach&mdash;there is plenty of money to be made from cloud services, while also providing open tool that will stimulate API growth across many business sectors. Which, creates more need for services.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">Low Hanging Fruit For API Discovery In The Federal Government</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/developer_hubs"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/looking-at-77-federal-government-api-developer-portals-and-190-apis/">looked through 77 of the developer areas for federal agencies</a>, resulting in reviewing approximately 190 APIs. While the presentation of 95% of the federal government developer portals are crap, it makes me happy that about 120 of the 190 APIs (over 60%) are actually consumable web APIs, that didn't make me hold my nose and run out of the API area.&nbsp;
<p>Of the 190, only 13 actually made me happy for one reason or another:
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html">OpenFDA</a></strong> - Well, I've already <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">gushed about OpenFDA</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2">Climate Data Online Web Services</a>&nbsp;</strong>- Just a clean, valuable, well done API for government.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/">National Climate Data Center</a> -</strong> Nice portal, valuable datasets, just needs some nice APIs and BOOM!</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.nrel.gov/">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> - </strong>NREL just get it, they are doing some great APIs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.dol.gov/">Department of Labor</a> - </strong>DOL's approach to their API design and developer area makes me happy.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://va-data.github.io/va-facilities/#!/facilities">VA Facilities Locator Web Service</a> -</strong> Only makes me happy because I did the work already. ;-)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://va-data.github.io/va-press/#!/press">VA Press Releases</a> - </strong>Only makes me happy because I did the work already. ;-)</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/developers/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> -</strong> Slick stuff. Nice Area. Great APIs. interactive docs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://my.usa.gov/developer/">MyUSA Citizen API</a> -</strong> Interestingly simple API, yet massive API concept, curious of the scope, implementation and use of oAuth in federal gov.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://exoapi.com/">ExoAPI</a> -</strong> Very cool API. Space yo!&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.asterank.com/skymorph">SkyMorph/NEAT API</a>&nbsp; - </strong>Very cool API. Space yo!&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://marsweather.ingenology.com/">{MAAS} API</a> -&nbsp;</strong>Very cool API. Space yo!&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://predictthesky.org/"> Predict the Sky API</a> -</strong>Very cool API. Space yo!&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there are other nice implementations in there. I like the simplicity and consistency in APIs coming out of GSA, SBA, but overall federal APIs reflect what I see a lot in the private sector, some developer making a decent API, but their follow-through and launch severeley lacks what it takes to make the API successful. People wonder why nobody uses their APIs? hmmmmm....
<p>A little minimalist simplicity in a developer portal, simple explanation of what an API does, interactive documentation w/ Swagger, code libraries, terms of service (TOS), wouild go a looooooooooooong way in making sure these government resources were found, and put to use.&nbsp;
<p>Ok, so where the hell do I start? Let's look through theses 123 APIs and see where the real low hanging fruit for demonstrating the potential of APIs.json, when it comes to API discovery in the federal government.
<p>Let's start again with the <strong>White House&nbsp;</strong>(<a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.whitehouse.gov/developers'&gt;http:/www.whitehouse.gov/developers&lt;/a&gt;"></a><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/developers">http://www.whitehouse.gov/developers</a>):
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='https:/petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers'&gt;https:/petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers&lt;/a&gt;">White House Petition API</a>&nbsp;-</strong> No swagger, but simple, high value API that is totally worth doing.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Only one API made it out of the <strong>USDA</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Research Service</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer.aspx#.U732Mo1dU_2">http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer.aspx#.U732Mo1dU_2</a></span>&nbsp;- Almost there. The landing page looks good, but the API documentation isn't really there. Could be really easily. Looks like a well crafted API.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Department of Commerce (<a href="https://www.commerce.gov/developer">http://www.commerce.gov/developer</a>):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Census Bureau API -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.census.gov/developers/">http://www.census.gov/developers/</a></span>&nbsp;- Yes, a real developer area with supporting building blocks. (Update, News,( App Gallery, Forum, Mailing List).&nbsp;Really could use interactive document though. There are urls, but not active calls. Would be way easier if you could play with data, before committing. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Severe Weather Data Inventory -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/swdiws/">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/swdiws/</a></span>&nbsp;- Fairly basic interface, wouldn&rsquo;t take much to turn into modern web API. Right now its just a text file, with a spec style documentation explaining what to do. Looks high value. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Climatic Data Center Climate Data Online Web Services </strong>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2</a> -&nbsp;</span>Oh yeah, now we are talking. That is an API. No interactive docs, but nice clean ones, and would be some work, but could be done.<strong> (A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Environmental Research Division's Data Access Program -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/rest.html">http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/rest.html</a></span>&nbsp;- Looks like a decent web API. Wouldn&rsquo;t be too much to generate a machine readable definition and make into a better API area.&nbsp;<strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Space Physics Interactive Data Resource Web Services -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://spidr.ngdc.noaa.gov/spidr/docs/SPIDR.REST.WSGuide.en.pdf">http://spidr.ngdc.noaa.gov/spidr/docs/SPIDR.REST.WSGuide.en.pdf</a></span>&nbsp;- Well its a PDF, but looks like a decent web API. It would be some work but could turn into a decide API with Swagger specs.&nbsp;<strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/">http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/</a></span>&nbsp;- Fairly straightforward API, Simple. Wouldn&rsquo;t be hard to generate interactive docs for it. Spec needed. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arlington Cemetary:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arlington National Cemetary -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Developer/">http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Developer/</a></span>&nbsp;- Pretty decent web API. Poor presentation, but well designed so it wouldn&rsquo;t be hard to generate machine readable sec. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Department of Education:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department of Education -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.ed.gov/developers">http://www.ed.gov/developers</a></span>&nbsp;- Lots of high value datasets. Says API, but is JSON file. Wouldn&rsquo;t be hard to generate APIs for it all and make machine readable definitions.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Energy:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy Information Administration -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/developer/">http://www.eia.gov/developer/</a></span>&nbsp;- Nice web API, simple clean presentation. Needs interactive docs.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Renewable Energy Laboratory -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://developer.nrel.gov/">http://developer.nrel.gov/</a></span>&nbsp;- Close to a modern Developer area with web APIs. Uses standardized access (umbrella). Some of them have Swagger specs, the rest would be easy to create.<strong> (A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Office of Scientific and Technical Information -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.osti.gov/XMLServices">http://www.osti.gov/XMLServices</a></span>&nbsp;- Interfaces are pretty well designed, and Swagger specs would be straightforward. But docs are all PDF currently. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Department of Health and Human Services</strong> (<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/developer">http://www.hhs.gov/developer</a>):
<ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Open FDA -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://open.fda.gov">http://open.fda.gov</a></span>&nbsp;- Nice API, nice API area. Not sure if there are machine readable specs, but definitely should be created. <strong>(A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Institute on Drug Abuse -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.drugabuse.gov/developer">http://www.drugabuse.gov/developer</a></span>&nbsp;- Simple, straightforward API.

</ul>
<p>That is a lot of potentially valuable API resource to consume. From my perspective, I think that what has come out of GSA, SBA, and White House Petition API, represent probably the simplest, most consistent, and high value targets for me. Next maybe the wealth of APis out of Interior and FDA. AFter that I'll cherry pick from the list, and see which are easiest.&nbsp;
<p>I'm lookig to create a Swagger definition for each these APIs, and publish as a Github repository, allowing people to play with the API. If I have to, I'll create a proxy for each one, because CORS is not common across the federal government. I'm hoping to not spend to much time on proxies, because once I get in there I always want to improve the interface, and evolve a facade for each API, and I don't have that much time on my hands.

        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/developer_hubs"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I spent most of the day yesterday, looking through <a href="/admin/blog/http:/18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/developer_hubs">77 of the developer portals listed on the 18F Github portal</a>. While I wanted to evaluate the quality and approach of each of the agencies, my goal for this review cycle was to look for any APIs that already had machine readable API definitions, or would be low hanging fruit for the creation of <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger definitions</a>, as part of my wider API discovery work.
<p>I had just finished updating all my API Evangelist Network APIs to use verion 0.14 of <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and while I wait for the search engine <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> to update to support the new version, I wanted to see if I could start the hard work of applying API discovery to federal government APIs.&nbsp;
<p>Ideally all federal agencies would publish APIs.json on their own, placing it within the root of their domain, like they do with data.json, and provide an index of all of their APIs. Being all to familiar with how this stuff work, I know that if I want this to happen, I will have to generate APIs.json for many federal agencies first. However for the APis.json to have their intended impact, I need many of the APIs to have machine readable API definitions that I can point to--which equals more work for me! yay? ;-(
<p>My thinking is that I will look through all of the 77 developer areas, and resulting APIs looking for the low hanging fruit. Basically I would grade each API on its viability to be included in my federal government API discovery work. I spent minimal amount of time look at each API, and in some cases looking for the API, before giving up. I would inspect the supporting developer area, and the actual interface for complexity, helping me understand how hard it would be to hand craft a Swagger spec, and APIs.json for each agency and their APIs.&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(warning contains my raw un-edited notes from doing this research, not suitable for children)</em>
<p>As I went through, I wrote a couple of notes:
<ul>
<li><a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/'&gt;http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/&lt;/a&gt;">National Climate Data Center</a> is nice looking, and is a high profile--they should have a kick ass API!</li>
<li>Inversely <a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2#gettingStarted'&gt;http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2#gettingStarted&lt;/a&gt;">NOAAA Climate Data Online</a> very simple, clean and well done.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ed.gov/developers">Department of Education</a> is acceptable as dev area, only because of Socrata</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.nrel.gov/">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> just gets it. They just get it.</li>
<li>Some of these are billed as developer areas, but really just a single API. It is a start I guess.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I love me some <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/">Department of Labor</a>. Their developer area and API is freak'n cool!</li>
<li><a href="https://my.usa.gov/developer/">MyUSA citizen API </a>has oAuth!!! WTF. How did I not notice this before? Another story, and work here.</li>
<li>MyUSA has really good, simple, high value, API resources.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://exoapi.com/">NASA ExoAPI</a> not just API cool, but space cool!!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.foia.gov/developer.html">FOIA</a> needs a fucking API. No excuses. FOIA needs an API!</li>
<li>Some APIs it might be better to go back to data source and recreate API from scratch, they are so bad.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to share some of my notes, before the long list of developer areas, and their APIs. There are some specific notes for each APIs, but much of it is very general, helping grade each API, so I can go back through the list of B grade or higher APIs, and figure out which are candidates for me to create a Swagger API definition, APIs.json and ultimately adding to APIs.io.&nbsp;
<p>For this work I went down the <a href="https://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/developer_hubs">77 federal agency links</a>, which were billed as developer areas, but many were single APIs. So when a developer area resulted in multiple APIs, I grouped them together, and many of the agencies who have a single API I will group together, and include my commentary as necessary. I'm leaving the URLs visible to help as a reference, show the craziness of some of them, and because it would have been sooooo much work to apply all of them.
<p>Let's start with the <strong>White House</strong>(<a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.whitehouse.gov/developers'&gt;http:/www.whitehouse.gov/developers&lt;/a&gt;"></a><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/developers">http://www.whitehouse.gov/developers</a>):
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='https:/petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers'&gt;https:/petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers&lt;/a&gt;">White House Petition API</a>&nbsp;-</strong> No swagger, but simple, high value API that is totally worth doing.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Next up is the <strong>USDA</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=USDA_DEVELOPER">http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=USDA_DEVELOPER</a>), which is a hodgepodge of service, no consistency whatsoever between services in interface, supporting content or anything.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><strong>Farmers Market Directory API</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/v1/svcdesc.html">http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/v1/svcdesc.html</a></span> - worthwhile API, but soap,</li>

Barf.</li>
<li><strong>Recreation Information Database&nbsp; -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/">https://ridb.recreation.gov/</a></span> - Kinda sort of cool</li>

</ul>
<p>Overall I give USDA a <strong>D</strong> on all their APIs. A couple might be high value sources, and going after, but definitely not low hanging fruit for me. It would be easier to tackle as independent project for generating brand new APIs.
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Research Service</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer.aspx#.U732Mo1dU_2">http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer.aspx#.U732Mo1dU_2</a></span>&nbsp;- Almost there. The landing page looks good, but the API documentation isn't really there. Could be really easily. Looks like a well crafted API.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Next up is Department of Commerce (<a href="https://www.commerce.gov/developer">http://www.commerce.gov/developer</a>), who definitely high some higher value resources, as well as some health API initiatives.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><strong>Bureau of Economic Analysis API -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm">http://bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm</a> -&nbsp;</span>Signed up for key, don&rsquo;t see any docs? Looks clean, but we&rsquo;ll see if anything there. An email address. yay!<strong> (C)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Census Bureau API -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.census.gov/developers/">http://www.census.gov/developers/</a></span>&nbsp;- Yes, a real developer area with supporting building blocks. (Update, News, App Gallery, Forum, Mailing List).&nbsp;Really could use interactive document though. There are urls, but not active calls. Would be way easier if you could play with data, before committing. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>International Trade Administration Export Trade Events -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://new.export.gov/events">https://new.export.gov/events</a></span>&nbsp;- Don&rsquo;t see an API<strong> (F)</strong></li>

<li>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://madis.noaa.gov/madis_api_doc.html">http://madis.noaa.gov/madis_api_doc.html</a></span>&nbsp;- Not really a web API. If I could find data, it would be a good facade project. <strong>(C)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Legacy National Climatic Data Center RESTful Services -</strong> <a href="http://www7">http://www7</a>.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ncdc.noaa.gov/rest/</span>&nbsp;- Wouldn&rsquo;t take much to build a facade for this one, so that it would be a real API. As it is, its just too confusing. Simple, but confusing. Takes talent to do that. <strong>(C)</strong></li>
<li><strong>GIS Map Services -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.climate.gov/datasearch/">http://www.climate.gov/datasearch/</a></span>&nbsp;- Looks like a bunch of datasets, no real API found.

<li>Severe Weather Data Inventory - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/swdiws/">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/swdiws/</a></span>&nbsp;- Fairly basic interface, wouldn&rsquo;t take much to turn into modern web API. Right now its just a text file, with a spec style documentation explaining what to do. Looks high value. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>General National Climatatic Data Center THREDDS Data Server -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog.html">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog.html</a></span>&nbsp;- File store with folders and folder and folders of data.

That is an API. No interactive docs, but nice clean ones, and would be some work, but could be done.<strong> (A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Digital Forecast Database SOAP Web Service -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://graphical.weather.gov/xml/">http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/</a></span>&nbsp;- SOAP service.

<li><strong>Space Physics Interactive Data Resource Web Services -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://spidr.ngdc.noaa.gov/spidr/docs/SPIDR.REST.WSGuide.en.pdf">http://spidr.ngdc.noaa.gov/spidr/docs/SPIDR.REST.WSGuide.en.pdf</a></span>&nbsp;- Well its a PDF, but looks like a decent web API. It would be some work but could turn into a decide API with Swagger specs.&nbsp;<strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Telecommunications and Information Administration -</strong> National Broadband Map - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www2.ntia.doc.gov/broadband-data">http://www2.ntia.doc.gov/broadband-data</a></span>&nbsp;- Not an API, but dataset, with a lot of work it could be turned into a decent experience. <strong>(C</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Patent and Trademark Office - </strong>Trademark Status &amp; Document Retrieval - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/">http://tsdr.uspto.gov/</a></span>&nbsp;- I don&rsquo;t see any API, just a web search? <strong>(C)</strong></li>
<li>International Trade Administration -&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://developer.trade.gov/">http://developer.trade.gov/</a></span>&nbsp;- I didn&rsquo;t see any API. They talk about it, but don&rsquo;t see how to access.<strong> (F)</strong></li>

<li><strong>Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/">http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/</a></span>&nbsp;- Fairly straightforward API, Simple. Wouldn&rsquo;t be hard to generate interactive docs for it. Spec needed. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Climate Data Center -</strong>&nbsp;<a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/'&gt;http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/&lt;/a&gt;"></a><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/</a>&nbsp;- Sexy site, well done. But no API. Datasets, so API could be created. Cache API. <strong>(C)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Next with the <strong>Department of Defense (</strong><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.defense.gov/developer/">http://www.defense.gov/developer/</a>)</span></span><span>There are 8 things billed as aPIs, with a variety of datasets, API like things, and web services available.&nbsp; Not really sure whats up? <strong>(D)</strong></span>
<p>We have one by itself here:
<ul>
<li><strong>Arlington National Cemetary -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Developer/">http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Developer/</a></span>&nbsp;- Pretty decent web API. Poor presentation, but well designed so it wouldn&rsquo;t be hard to generate machine readable sec. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Then the department of education who is just riding their data.gov work as API area:
<ul>
<li><strong>Department of Education -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.ed.gov/developers">http://www.ed.gov/developers</a></span>&nbsp;- Lots of high value datasets. Says API, but is JSON file. Wouldn&rsquo;t be hard to generate APIs for it all and make machine readable definitions.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Next some energy related efforts:
<ul>
<li><strong>Department of Energy -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.energy.gov/developers">http://www.energy.gov/developers</a></span>&nbsp;- Lots of datasets. Pretty presentation.&nbsp; Could use some simple APIs,. Wouldn&rsquo;t be much to pick high value data sets and create cache of them. <strong>(C)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Energy Information Administration -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/developer/">http://www.eia.gov/developer/</a></span>&nbsp;- Nice web API, simple clean presentation. Needs interactive docs.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Renewable Energy Laboratory -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://developer.nrel.gov/">http://developer.nrel.gov/</a></span>&nbsp;- Close to a modern Developer area with web APIs. Uses standardized access (umbrella). Some of them have Swagger specs, the rest would be easy to create.<strong> (A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Office of Scientific and Technical Information -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.osti.gov/XMLServices">http://www.osti.gov/XMLServices</a></span>&nbsp;- Interfaces are pretty well designed, and Swagger specs would be straightforward. But docs are all PDF currently. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on to the <strong>Department of Health and Human Services</strong> (<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/developer">http://www.hhs.gov/developer</a>), which all of their APis are somewhat cosistent, and provide simple resources:
<ul>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>I recently updated my APIs.json files for all my API Evangelist network domains, to use version 0.14, which is getting pretty close to a stable version. While I await <a href="https://bit.ly/1mtaqmK">APIs.io</a> to be updated to use this version, I wanted to to spend some time publishing APIs.json files, but this time across federal government APIs.
<p>The thing I like most about APIs.json, is that you can do one for anybody else&rsquo;s APIs. In the case of our federal government, I don't anticipate any agency getting on board with APIs.json anytime soon, but I can do it for them! There are a lot of APIs in federal government, where do I get started?
<p>To help me understand the scope of API discovery in our federal government <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/looking-at-77-federal-government-api-developer-portals-and-190-apis/">I looked through 77 developer portals</a>, outlined by <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>. While browsing these developer portals for federal government agencies, I look at almost 190 APIs--with a goal of&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">identifying the low hanging fruit</a>, when it came to API discovery across hundreds of government APIs.
<p>Out of the 190 APIs, around 120 of them were actual web APIs, that were something I felt I could work with. I settled on a handful of APIs out of the GSA, hosted at <a href="http://www.usa.gov.apievangelist.com/">www.usa.gov</a>, and <a href="http://explore.data.gov.apievangelist.com/index.html">explore.data.gov</a>, and got to work creating APIs.json for their APIs.
<p>Before I could generate an APIs.json at each of the two domains (www.usa.gov and explore.data.gov), I needed machine readable API definition for the four APIs. I purposely picked federal agency APIs that were REST(flu), and were something I could easily generate a Swagger definition for.
<p><a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
<p>The <a href="https://explore.data.gov/developers/docs/federal-executive-agency-internet-domains">federal agency domain API at explore.data.gov</a> was pretty easy, ony taking me a few minutes to handcraft a Swagger definition. Then I moved on to the <a href="https://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/federal-agency-directory/index.shtml">Federal Agency Directory API at www.usa.gov</a>, and I was happy to see there was already a Swagger definition for the API. After that I tackled the <a href="https://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/social-media-registry.shtml">Social Media Registry API</a>, and <a href="https://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/mobile-app-gallery/index.shtml">Mobile App Gallery API</a>, both of which I had to handcraft a Swagger definition for. The Mobile App Gallery API has a CORS issue, but I'm moving on and will setup a proxy to handle later.
<p>Now I have four machine readable API definitions for some pretty valuable government APIs, and I got to work creating my APIs.json that would act as a directory for these API resources. APIs.json are designed to go into the root domain of any API provider, and the four GSA APIs I selected ran under two separate domains (www.usa.gov and explore.data.gov), so I needed two separate APIs.json files:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.usa.gov.apievangelist.com/apis.json">www.usa.gov/apis.json</a></li>
<li><a href="http://explore.data.gov.apievangelist.com/apis.json">explore.data.gov/apis.jso</a>n</li>
</ul>
<p>When APIs.io gets updated to the latest version of APIs.json, I will submit both of these APIs.json files for indexing. Even though I&rsquo;m not the owner of these domains, I can still submit for inclusion in the API search engine. It would be better if the GSA published the APIs.json, and Swagger API definitions at the actual domains, and submitted themselves--the listings would then show as being authoritative, and hold more weight in API searches.
<p>I still have about 115 more federal government APIs to create machine readable API definitions for, and the resulting APIs.json files that will enable discovery of these APIs--this isn&rsquo;t something that will happen overnight, and will take a shit-ton of work.
<p>My goal is to help harden the APIs.json format, while making APIs in federal government more accessible, and part of the larger API discovery conversation that is going on in the private sector. One of the powerful features of APIs.json, is that external actors can craft APIs.json collections, from the outside. You don&rsquo;t have to be an owner of a domain, where an API is hosted, to publish an APIs.json on its behalf--I think this represents the potential of the public sector and private sector working together.&nbsp;
<p>APis.json are meant to work as collections of APis, or virtual stacks of valuable API resources. Sometimes these virtual stacks are defined internally, within a domain, and sometimes they are mashups of multiple API resources, across numerous domains, by outside actors, or API curators. I will keep curating federal government APIs, generating machine readable API definitions, APIs.json files for their supporting domains--helping define this fun new world of API discovery.

        <span class="post-date">09 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/apis-json/apis-json-gears.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>An <a href="http://apis.json">APIs.json</a>&nbsp;file lives in the root of any domain, or subdomain, and provides references to a collection of API resources. The APIs.json is meant to be a lightweight framework, where someone can build a collection of APIs, give it a name, description, some tags, and the APIs collection points you where you need to go, to get more information about those APIs.
<p>For each API, you can define a list of URLs, each with a defining &ldquo;type&rdquo;, letting you know what to expect when you visit the URL. Right now, most of those URLs are just for humans, pointing to the developer portal, document, and terms of service (TOS). We are adding other API url types, that API search engines like <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a> can expose in their search interfaces, like code samples, and application gallery, to the next version of APIs.json.
<p>These human API URL types provide a reference, that API search engines can use to guide human users who are searching for APIs. However, where the real power of APIs.json comes in, is when an API URL type references a machine readable source, like a <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger definition</a>, or an <a href="http://apicommons.org/add-apis.html">API Commons manifest</a>. When it comes to API discovery, we need as many meaningful locations, that we can point human API consumers to, but also machine readable locations, that will help make API discovery much more rich, automated, and precise.
<p>Imagine when I can do more than just search name, description, and tags, by keyword, much like <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a> works currently. Imagine when you can specify that you only want APIs that are in the <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, and openly licensed. Imagine when I can search for APIs that allow me to use all my HTTP verbs, not just GET. Now, go even more in the future, when I can search for APIs who have a specific allowance in their terms of service, with a machine readable TOS type for APIs.json.
<p>This is where I want to take APIs.json, and ultimately API discovery. Machine readable API definitions like API Blueprint, RAML, and Swagger are the very first API URL type that helps automate API discovery, and the API Commons manifest is the latest. My goal is to tackle terms of service, pricing, and other critical aspects of API integration, and push forward a machine readable definition, that can ultimately be baked into the API discovery process--in all API search engines.
<p>What is important to me, is that the API URL types, in each APIs.json, remain independent, and only loosely coupled with the APIs.json format, using a simple label, and URL. I&rsquo;m not directly invested in the evolution of each Swagger version, however I am with API Commons, and potentially other future APIs.json API URL type definitions. I want anyone to be able to step up and suggest API URL types for the APIs.json spec, making APIs.json URL types a community driven API discovery layer, for the API economy.

<p>When I first published 11 simple API definitions, I had developed using <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a>, into the <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, I made a mistake when I referenced the Swagger specifications for each of the APIs. I linked to the machine readable Swagger spec, but not the raw JSON stored on Github, errorneously I linked directly to the Github page.
<p>I want the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-commons/api-commons/gh-pages/data/apis.json">machine readable API datastore</a>, at API Commons, which is used to drive the <a href="http://apicommons.org/apis.html">API listing page</a>, to be completely machine readable, referencing all APIs, their machine readable API Commons manifest, as well as machine readable API definition. As the smart folks over at <a href="https://www.apimatic.io/">APIMatic</a> pointed out to me, I had been flip-flopping on this. Some of my later entries were machine readable pointers, but my earlier entries were not.
<p>Now all of the entries in the commons, have machine readable references to both their API Commons manifest, and API definition. I've also added a &ldquo;<a href="http://apicommons.org/format.html">format</a>&rdquo; page, to explain each of the fields, in the the API Commons manifest format, to help API providers better understand, and not make the same mistake I made.
<p>The API Commons manifest is meant to be a standalone, machine readable pointer to an APIs central truth (a machine readable API definition), and associated CC-BY-SA or CC0 licensing, and now, I think we have achieved our original goals around making this happen.

        <p><a href="https://apimatic.io" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/apimatic/apimatic-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;ve expanded my monitoring on the world of APIs, from just API management, which I&rsquo;ve been doing for four years, into tracking on APIs across multiple buckets I'm calling <a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a title="API deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a title="API monetization" href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">monetization</a>, <a title="API Evangelism" href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com">evangelism</a>, <a title="API discovery" href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a>, <a title="API integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>, <a title="API aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">aggregation</a>, <a title="reciprocity" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">reciprocity</a>, and <a title="API real time" href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com">real-time</a>. I am always working to understand who the key players are across the API space, but also make sure they are categorized into one, or many of these expanding buckets--helping me quantify things.
<p>It is always very interesting to see how an API service provider fits into more than one of these buckets, as well as when new players emerge to cater to just one of these buckets, like Apiary did with API design. Playing on this theme, I was introduced to new a new API service provider, called <a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMatic</a> the other day, who on the surface seems to cater to API providers with the automatic generation of SDKs, but really is a cross-over into API design, discovery, and integration, bringing a new perspective to the table.
<p><strong>Generating SDKs Is The Carrot</strong><br /> As soon as you land on the APIMatic home page, they state very clearly what they do "Automatic SDK Generation for APIs&rdquo;. You can search common APIs that are available in the APIMatic API marketplace, import your own API definition, or build one using their web-based user interface&mdash;which pretty squarely makes APIMatic for API consumers, providing clear API integration benefits, but via the generation of SDKs.
<p><strong>GUI Tool For API Design</strong><br /> The third option for generating an SDK from an API, is using the APIMatic web-based user interface, which allows you to build a definition of your API, using a web interface&mdash;no coding necessary.  You can create a new definition, manage its settings, define endpoints, and the underlying data model. When ready, you can generate your SDK, which is rendered, I&rsquo;m guessing using the default APIMatic format, and then also allows you to generate mock APIs, and sandbox environments--pretty squarely in the world of API design for me.
<p><strong>Provides API Discovery</strong><br /> Then the first option for generating an SDK is from a marketplace of existing APIs, allowing developers to generate SDKs for the most common APIs they depend on. From an API provider standpoint, this is a huge incentive for generating machine readable API definitions like Swagger, and register with marketplaces like APIMatic. I&rsquo;d say APIMatic starts with a very Mashape style API marketplace for discovery, but then quickly focuses heavily on quality SDKS, and API integration as the end deliverable.
<p><strong>Supporting API Integration</strong><br /> Since APIMatic generates the code that sits between your app and the API resources it depends on, it has a unique lens for looking into how your applications are using APIs. This provides an alternative approach to the proxies and tooling I'm seeing emerge to monitor, track, test, and report on API integration. I&rsquo;m not sure of the pros and cons to this type of API integration, but think APIMatic vision is worth taking a closer look at.
<p><a href="https://apimatic.io" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/apimatic/apimatic-search-import-specify.png" alt="" width="575" /></a>
<p><strong>Mobile Focused Software Development Kits (SDK)</strong><br /> APIMatic focuses on delivering mobile SDKs, for iOS, Android, Windows, and Java platforms. When I talked to the founders, they said they would eventually provide more web focused SDKs, but mobile is obviously a major driver of API consumption, and was the low hanging fruit.
<p><strong>Centered Around Machine Readable API Definitions</strong><br /> Everything about APIMatic is centered around API definitions. When you select to import an API, you are given the option to import APIMatic, WADL, Swagger, IODocs, GoogleREST, and MashapeJSON. Each of the APIs available in marketplace have a machine readable definition, as well as the web-based form builder generating a machine readable API definition as well. These definitions are then used to generate SDKs, mock interfaces, and full circle back to listing you in the APIMatic marketplace for discovery&mdash;if you wish to make your API public.
<p><strong>Quality Software Development Kits (SDK)</strong><br /> Another aspect I find interesting about APIMatic, is that they focus on not just generating code stubs, they focus on high quality SDKs. Which in an era where you here a lot of rhetoric around SDKs being poorly written, out of date, hard to maintain, and unecessary--this gives APIMatic a potentially important differentiator if they do it right. APIMatic takes pride in their code being well written, looking nice, and following good conventions--something that could go a long ways in benefiting both API providers, and consumers.
<p>Seeing new breeds of API service providers continue to emerge, with even new perspectives on how the API lifecycle operates, makes me happy, and with everything centered around machine readable, common API definitions, I'm even more pleased. This is in sync with what I&rsquo;m seeing come out of the API design, deployment, management, and integration providers I've been tracking on&mdash;that API definitions are increasingly driving all stops along the API lifecycle subway.
<p>I will play with APIMatic some more. To be honest, I was approaching this from an API providers perspective when I jumped on the Google Hangout with them, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw that they crossed over into API design, integration, discovery, as well as management. Now that I have a good idea of what they offer, I will revisit what the benefits to API providers could be. At the very least, it is another carrot for API providers to be sure and generate machine readable definitions for their APIs&mdash;without it your APIs won&rsquo;t be found, or be able to be imported, and drive the next generation of API tooling like APIMatic.
<p>APIMatic is looking to meet API providers, and get your API listed, so if you reach out, make sure and let them know I sent you. If you <a href="https://apimatic.io/Account/Register?Reference=C402F205-7E97-40EF-9894-BF1AFDBA9055">use this link</a>, and sign up, you will automatically be let into the beta users group--APIMatic is currently &ldquo;invite only&rdquo;.
<p>Oh, I also had a good conversation with them about the possibilities around integration of APIMatic with <a href="https://bit.ly/1e27KIc">API Commons</a>, and distributed API search engines like <a href="https://bit.ly/1mtaqmK">APIs.io</a>, using <a href="https://bit.ly/1ij6TTP">APIs.json</a>&mdash;so more to come. Much more!

<p>I talk about this concept often, but couldn't find any definitive post on APIs opening up a company, organization, or agency to outside ideas. This is something I hear from startups, up to federal government agencies, and from well known business brands, such as Absolut Vodka.
<p>Absolut was one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXk1dvLKl-U">keynotes at API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam</a>, this last march. Eva Sjokvist, from Absolut, walked us through the development of their <a href="https://addb.absolutdrinks.com/docs/">Absolut Drinks Database API</a>.&nbsp;An amazing story by itself, but one thing she said that stood out to me, which is an interestingly common by-product of the API lifecycle, was the process itself opened up the company, making it more receptive to outside ideas, and collaboration.
<p>I hear this sentiment often from groups who are developing API programs at their companies, and you see shining examples, like <a href="http://developer.edmunds.com/">from Edmunds.com</a> with their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/27/internal-api-summit-within-every-company/">internal API Summit</a>, but rarely do I see a metric to measure API driven, cultural change. APIs don't just open up your company&rsquo;s assets and resources for access by trusted partners, or potentially the public, establishing a sort of external R&amp;D lab, it has the potential to open up a valuable feedback loop as well, bringing in new ideas that have the potential to change how a group sees the world--evolving internal culture.
<p>The potential for opening up a company, bringing them closer to their partners and customers, or a government agency, opening up healthier dialogue with constituents, is the most important results of an API program&mdash;greater than any single application that will get built on an API.

<p>I was exchanging emails with someone regarding API design considerations at their large institutions today, and where they could find healthy patterns for API designs within their industry. As with any API provider, they were concerned with emulating the best API design patterns they could, and evolve the design of their own services. They put it like this:
<blockquote><em>..."our APIs largely expose our internal mess and legacy design rather than presenting a well thought out, consistent view of the important resources and operations"...</em></blockquote>
<p>We all want to deploy the best designed API that we possibly can, but with a lack of meaningful API definition formats (until recently), and nowhere to go and search or browse for common API design patterns (something 3Scale and API Evangelist want to fix with <a href="https://bit.ly/1e27KIc">API Commons</a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/1ij6TTP">APIs.json</a>, and <a href="https://bit.ly/1mtaqmK">APIs.io</a>), it can be difficult to know exactly what is good API design for our respective industries.
<p>It would be nice, if all of the APIs we designed were brand new, perfectly architected to follow best of breed REST patterns, and we had all the time in the world to research and design. In reality, many of the APIs we design will ony act as a facade for some legacy beast of a system, that won't go away anytime soon. We are working to get more places like API Commons and APIs.io available to find the best API design patterns, and you should always look at as many of the APIs in your industry as you can, when designing your APIs, but most importantly, don't be concerned with a perfect interface--right out of the gate.
<p>In reality, we have to just walk a line between the perfect API design, and the ugly legacy IT worlds, we are building these API facades to hide. The sooner we get the first version of the facade up, we can then iterate, and turn our APIs into the mirror image of the designs we ultimately desire&mdash;until then it is just smoke and mirrors, smoke and mirrors.

<p>I am continuing my <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">research into how universities are using APIs</a>, and while I was going through the developer areas for the universities I track on, I noticed an interesting mobile developer toolkit, from <a href="http://developer.it.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>.
<p>When you land on the homepage of the <a href="http://developer.it.umich.edu/">University of Michigan developer portal</a>, to the right you will see some valuable resources that is looking to help developers think through the bigger picture of designing, developing, deploying, testing and distributing, mobile application that are built on campus resources.
<p>The University of Michigan mobile developer toolkit is broken down into four separate groups:
<h3>Design</h3>

</ul>
<p>I think the resources they provide, represent a very long term vision around delivering API resources to developers, who will be building applications for the institution--something that all universities should look at emulating.
<p>You want developers, who are building mobile applications on top of campus API resources to be successful, so providing them with the education, training and resources they need to deliver, is critical.
<p>I also think it is cool, that at the bottom of the mobile developer toolkit, they provide two other links:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://mobileapps.its.umich.edu/devtoolkit/collaborate">Collaborate</a> - Campus and local developer groups.</li>
<li><a href="http://mobileapps.its.umich.edu/devtoolkit/opportunities">Opportunities</a> - App competition notices.</li>
</ul>
<p>They want their app developers to socialize with other campus application developers, and be aware of opportunities to compete in hackathons and other competitions--on and off campus.
<p>Developing mobile applications is the number one incentive for universities to deploy APIs, and jumpstart their API efforts like at <a href="https://developer.byu.edu/wiki/display/SOA/Home">BYU</a>, <a href="http://developer.it.umich.edu/">UW</a> and <a href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>, and&nbsp;it just makes sense to provide a mobile developer toolkit for developers. Education around APIs and mobile application development is critical to the success of any API initiative, but even more so, when it occurs across a large institution, by a variety of internal and external groups.
<p>I&rsquo;ll add the mobile developer toolkit to my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">list common building blocks</a> for not just university APIs, but all API initiatives.

<p>I'm working a wider campaign focused on getting my shit together around my images, and part of that is continueing work I had started with my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a>, and launch more image manipulation API resources.
<p>I have a wide range of needs to resize, crop, filter, and apply other filters to photos I work with, as part of my storytelling, and if I had a set of image manipulation APIs, life would be better--so as I do with anything, I got to work building an API.
<p>The result is the first, in a series of&nbsp;<a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">image manipulation APIs</a>. Right now I focused on some low hanging fruit, like applying filters to images, which includes Charcoal, Oil Painting, Polaroid, and Sketch. Next, I will tackle some more utility APIs like resize, crop, and rotate.
<p>Like my other APIs, I will use my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/an-operational-harness-for-my-screen-capture-api/">operational harness</a>, and operate a <a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/">cloud version of my image manipulation API</a>, where anyone can access, and take advantage of my API resources. Using my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/14/service-composition-for-my-screen-capture-api/">API service composition</a>, I setup access tiers for public, partners and internal usage.&nbsp;
<p>I will also open source any code behind so that others can deploy image manipulation within their own infrastructure, or I'm happy to setup for you--for a fee! :-)
<p>I have a number of APIs I want to get built, and image manipulation has been on my list for a while, I'm glad I finally was able to get this work started.

<p>I have a lot of ideas while being the API Evangelist. It just comes with the territory. I have an Evernote folder that I publish these ideas to, and some of them, like my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">Screen Capture API</a>, I actually make a reality.
<p>The other night while writing, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/02/shadow-api-launching-an-api-before-someone-else-does/">Shadow API: Launching An API Before Someone Else Does</a>, I went to add the Nebraska homestead record API idea to my Evernote, and I said, ENOUGH! I need a public place to store these ideas, and while I'm at it, I'll enable others to publish ideas there too.
<p>What better way to allow collaboration around a content store or dataset, than a Github repository plus API. So I launched <a href="http://ideas.apievangelist.com/">API Ideas</a>, as an individual API project, on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist Network</a>.

<p>I&rsquo;ll be evolving the API over time, you can <a href="http://ideas.apievangelist.com/roadmap.html">engage with me on the roadmap</a>, and see <a href="http://ideas.apievangelist.com/blog/">stories around the project on the updates page</a>. It is just a start, and I will be adding a lot more bells and whistles, and improve search, as I have time.

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/IFTVT-logo.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" />
<p>In the tech space, when we see a pattern that works, we run with it. This is why you hear, &ldquo;It is the Uber for X&rdquo;, or &ldquo;It is the Github for X&rdquo;, and I recently talked about how I&rsquo;m starting to see more of, &ldquo;<a title="It is the If This Then That (IFTT) for X" href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/16/its-if-this-then-that-for-x/">It is the If This Then That (IFTT) for X</a>&rdquo;. The IFTTT model, or what I call &ldquo;reciprocity&rdquo;, is an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/10/bringing-etl-to-the-masses-with-apis/">evolution on the classic enterprise ETL model</a>, resulting in over 25 companies that I&rsquo;m tracking on in the space.
<p>Reciprocity works, because it is about solving a simple problem for everyday users, using APIs to take a single action&mdash;if this happens over there, use APIs, to do that over there. There are many other words used to describe this evolution of ETL in the clouds, including interoperability, and automation, I use reciprocity because it better describes what is happening as part of the growing global API economy.
<p>I recently went through all <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">65+ of my research projects</a>, one of them being <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">reciprocity</a>, and as I was working on new research areas around open data, analysis, and visualization, I started thinking about how the IFTTT (reciprocity) model could be applied to analysis and visualization&mdash;resulting in a draft model I would call <strong><em>If This Then Visualize That (IFTVT)</em></strong>.
<p>The IFTVT model provides the similar feedback loop as IFTTT, but instead of a resulting action, the end goal is a visualization.  If &ldquo;end of month&rdquo;, show me overview of Foursquare checkins. If &ldquo;Tweet receives 10 favorites&rdquo;, show me a list of Twitter users. If &ldquo;bank account goes below $50&rdquo;, show me last 25 charges. How you get your IFTVT visualizations would be up to you, maybe it is email, maybe SMS, maybe some sort of iGoogle like dashboard unit.
<p>As with the IFTTT model, IFTVT gives us actionable, meaningful results from our increasingly disparate digital worlds. Using reciprocity, we are slowly being able to get a handle on the cloud versions of ourselves, and I think the next step could be analysis and resulting visualizations, in bit-size, meaningful, informative chunks via the channels that matter most to us.
<p>Ok, get to work geeks! I&rsquo;ll tell the story, if you build it. ;-)

        <span class="post-date">03 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apis.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/apis-io/apis-io.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I wanted to stop and reflect for a moment on the open source, distributed API search engine, that <a href="https://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist developed, in support of the <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json discovery format</a>. When we conceived the APIs.json API discovery format, we knew that the project would be dead in the water, if there wasn&rsquo;t a clear incentive for API providers to generate an <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>&mdash;helping them get their APIs found.
<p>Until 2014, when you said "search for APIs", it meant going to a website (<a href="http://programmableweb.com">programmableweb.com</a>), and searching for an API in a curated directory of APIs. In the last couple years, we&rsquo;ve seen an evolution on this directory search model from Mashape, in the form of a hub or marketplace. Managed directories have their place in the world of API discovery, similar to the web directory realm, but as the number of APIs grow, we are desperately needing to go beyond just directory based API discovery, and like with the web, establish a meaningful search layer&mdash;we need a Google of API search.
<p>This is why 3Scale and API Evangelist developed APIs.json, and the first open tooling on top of the API discovery format, we called <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a>. We do not believe APIs.json + APIs.io is the next Google, but we do feel it will jumpstart the conversation around what is needed when it comes to API discovery. How do we find the best of breed APIs, not just on keyword search in the title and description, or driven from tags? We need a way for API providers to describe their APIs, and supporting building blocks, in a machine readable, distributed way, that can be indexed by many API discovery solutions.
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<p>When searching for APIs, we will need to find specific API interfaces, with very specialized terms of service, and pricing. We will need API rating solutions like <a href="http://api500.com/">API Rating Agency</a> baked into our API search algorithms. We need an extensible API discovery format, this is APIs.json. We need an open source search engine, that can be deployed as general search engine, or deployed as a specialized, niche, API search engine serving a specific business sector, like government--this is APIs.io.
<p>APIs.io now has 128 APIs in its index, submitted by 91 maintainers. We are just getting started, defining what is next for both APIs.json, and APIs.io, make sure and get involved early on, and help make your mark on this rapidly expanding world of API discovery.  You can <a href="http://apis.io/apis/add">add your APIs to APIs.io</a>, <a title="fork the open source API search engine code" href="https://github.com/apisio/apis.io">fork the open source API search engine code</a>&nbsp;(coming soon) and launch your own API search engine, or <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">provide feedback on the next version of APIs.json</a>, the format that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> help discover the valuable API resources everyone will be depending on in the API economy.

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/kin-aud-shadow.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>In a perfect world, every government agency, non-profit organization, and company would have an API, and the content and data available via their website, mobile applications, and other systems, would be accessible in an easy, machine readable way. This perfect world does not exist. Even though many government agencies, non-profit organizations, and companies are getting hip to the world of APIs, there is still massive amounts of work to be done, and I'm afraid if we want to see APIs across our government, we are going to have to do much of it ourselves.
<p>I was listening to an <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/07/02/327797193/digital-homestead-records-reopen-a-crucial-chapter-of-u-s-history">NPR story on the release of files detailing Nebraska's homesteading history</a>, a project between the National Archives and National Park Service, today. I wish I could be at all federal agencies, in all meetings, advocating for an API first approach to these projects--I can&rsquo;t. So, while we can celebrate the fact that the records around Nebraska&rsquo;s history have been digitized, and <a href="http://cdrh.unl.edu/homestead/">the website is very nice</a>, and usable for humans, THERE IS NO API!
<p>This is when the private sector has to step in and help our federal government realize the importance and potential of an API--we need a shadow API for the homestead records database. While the <a href="http://cdrh.unl.edu/homestead/">website is great for human consumptio</a>n, we also need a simple, machine readable API that other applications can put to use. It would be nice if the National Archives and National Park Service had made the API a priority, but I think this is where the private sector needs to step in, and make it happen.
<p>I have direct orders from my super secret White House contact(s) to challenge you, Joe and Jane citizen to see who can launch an API faster, around content or data that is already public (no hacking)&mdash;the federal government, or you the average tech savvy citizen. I won&rsquo;t give up my sources, but I&rsquo;m dead serious when I say the White House asked me to put the word out on this.
<p>Data sources like Nebraskas homestead records, are well structured web searches, and not that difficult to scrape. A savvy programmer could easily write a script to do it, and hand roll a simple API for others access the records. I also think a tech savvy non-programmer, could make happen by employing a modern API deployment tools like <a href="https://bit.ly/1iZ9EQ6">ScraperWiki</a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/1pKwOg9">Import.io</a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/1wWkDwH">Orchestrate.io</a>, or <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono Labs</a>. I don&rsquo;t imagine it taking more than a day or two, to scrape the data, and deploy a simple API interface from the results.
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a new concept, something API devlopers have been doing a while. The <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/full-featured-unpublished-instagram-api/2010/12/15">first Instagram API was a shadow API,</a> deployed by independent 3rd party developer, who reverse engineered the mobile application. Kimono Labs also just launched an <a href="http://www.kimonolabs.com/worldcup/explorer">unofficial World Cup API</a>, allowing for <a href="https://webkite.com/world-cup/">some pretty cool applications to be built on top of the shadow API</a>. Shadow APIs have been being deployed for years, we just need to make them more of a mainstream, acceptable way to make resources available via APIs, real fast!
<p>If you know of a shadow API you would like to see built, or you are available to deploy shadow APIs, let me know. There are some things I&rsquo;d like to see in quality shadow API deployments around government data (maybe another story), and I can help you get the word out when the time is right. In my opinion, if content or data is already available via a government website, or as a full data dowload, there should be an API for it. Period.
<p>What do you think? Who is going to build my Nebraska homestead record API, before I can harass the National Archives and National Park Service to do it?
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> <em>I'm not going to disclose my confidential sources at the White House, don't even ask or render me to a black ops site.</em>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a style="padding: 15px;" href="http://www.caulfield.pw:3000/view/welcome-visitors"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/smallest-federated-wiki/smallest-federated-wiki.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I'm always working to better understand the best of breed technology solutions available online today, and to me, this means, lightweight, machine readable apps that do one thing and do it well. One solution I&rsquo;m looking at is called the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.caulfield.pw:3000/view/welcome-visitors">Smallest Federated Wiki</a>, from Mike Caulfield(<a href="https://twitter.com/holden">@holden</a>), which has been on my list for several weeks now, but one of his <a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/06/20/smallest-federated-wiki-as-a-universal-json-canvas/">latest posts has floated it back onto my priority list</a>.
<p>To understand what the Smallest Federated Wiki (SFW) is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikA5rHA1uDg">check out the video</a>. I haven&rsquo;t personally downloaded and installed yet, which is something I do with all solutions that I&rsquo;m evaluating. SFW is Node.js, and <a href="https://github.com/fedwiki/wiki-node-server">available on Github</a>, if you want to play with as well--I'm going to be installing on AWS if you need an AMI. This post is all about understanding SFW, and light the fire under my own use of SFW, and hopefully stimulating your interest.
<p><strong>Simple</strong><br /> Building off the simplicity of the Wiki, SFW borrows from the best features of Wiki, Github, and rolled together into simple, but ultimately powerful implementation that embraces the latest in technology from Node.js to HTML5. I know how hard it can be to achieve "simple", and while playing with SFW, I can tell a lot of work has gone into keeping things as fucking simple as possible. #win
<p><strong>Federated</strong><br /> I love me some Wikipedia and Github, but putting my valuable content, and hard work into someone else&rsquo;s silo is proving to be a very bad idea. For all of my projects, I want to be able maximize collaboration, syndication and reach, without giving away ownership of my intellectual exhaust (IE) . SFW reflects this emotion, and allows me to browse other people&rsquo;s work, fork, re-use, while also maintaining my own projects within my silo, and enable other people to fork, and re-use from my work as well--SFW is a sneak peak at how <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span> modern applications <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHOULD</span> operate.
<p><strong>JSON Extensible</strong><br /> SFW has the look and feel of a new age wiki, allowing you two generate pages and pages of content, but the secret sauce underneath is JSON. Everything on SFW is JSON driven, allowing for unlimited extensibility. <a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/06/20/smallest-federated-wiki-as-a-universal-json-canvas/">MIke's latest blog post on how SFW&rsquo;s extensibility is unlimited</a>, due to it's JSON driven architecture, is why I'm floating SFW back on my review list. My 60+ API Evangelist projects all start with basic page, and blog content, but then rely on JSON driven research for companies, building blocks, tools, services, and many other data points that I track on for the space&mdash;SFW reflects the JSON extensibility I&rsquo;ve been embracing for the last couple years, but I'm doing this manually, SFW is by default.
<p><strong>Simplicity And Complexity</strong><br /> SFW achieves a simplicity, combined with the ability to extend the complexity in any way you choose. I can create a simple 3 page project site with it, or I could create a federated news application, allowing thousands of people to publish, curate, fork, remix, and collaborate around links&mdash;think Reddit, but federated. I envision SFW templates or blueprints, that allow me to quickly deploy a basic project blog, or CRM, news, research, and other more complex solutions. With <a href="https://www.docker.com/">new cloud deployment options like Docker emerging</a>, I see a future where I can quickly deploy these federated blueprints, on the open web, on-premise, or anywhere I desire.
<p>I have a lot of ideas that I want to contribute to the SFW roadmap, but I need to get more seat hours, playing with the code, before I can intelligently contribute. Once i get my base SFW setup, I will start brainstorming on the role APIs can play in the SFW plugin layer., and scenarios for rapidly building SFW blueprint containers.
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> While SFW has been on my Evernote todo list for several weeks, it was Mike's continued storytelling which bumped up the priority. Without the storytelling and evangelism, nothing happens--something Mike references in his post.

        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Corvette-Aft-Cat-Exhaust-System1.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>As I generate shitloads of content playing the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>&nbsp;on the Internets, I struggle with certain words, as I write each day&mdash;one of these words is intellectual property (IP), which Wikipedia defines as:
<blockquote><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">Intellectual property (IP) rights are the legally recognized exclusive rights to creations of the mind.[1] Under intellectual property law, owners are granted certain exclusive rights to a variety of intangible assets, such as musical, literary, and artistic works; discoveries and inventions; and words, phrases, symbols, and designs. Common types of intellectual property rights include copyright, trademarks, patents, industrial design rights, trade dress, and in some jurisdictions trade secrets.</a></em></blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the phrase intellectual property, specifically because it includes &ldquo;property&rdquo;. Nothing that comes from my intellect is property. Nothing. It isn&rsquo;t something you can own or control. Sorry, what gets generated from my intellect, wants to be free, not owned or controlled&mdash;it is just the way it is. I cannot be creative, generate my ideas and projects, if I know the output or results will be locked up.
<p>With this in mind I want to craft a new expression to describe the result of my intellectual output, I&rsquo;m going to call intellectual exhaust (IE). I like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaust">term exhaust, which has numerous definitions</a>, and reflects what can be emitted from my daily thoughts. You are welcome to collect, observe, remix, learn from, or get high off of the exhaust off my daily work&mdash;go right ahead, this is one of the many reasons I work so hard each day. You my loyal reader. One. Single.
<p>In my opinion, you can even make money off my intellectual exhaust, however, no matter what you do, make sure you attribute back, letting people know where your ideas come from. And if you do make some money from it, maybe you can kick some of that back, supporting the things that fuel my intellectual exhaust:  sleep, food, water, beer, and interactions with other smart people around the globe. ;-)
<p>P.S. There are other things that fuel my intellectual exhaust, but my lawyer and my girlfriend say I can&rsquo;t include some of them.
<p>P.S.S. My girlfriend is not my lawyer.

        <span class="post-date">02 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://bit.ly/1sgwGpq"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/amazon/Amazon_S3_Site.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I'm spending a lot of time updating my<a title="API Deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com"> API deployment research</a>&nbsp;lately, making sure it reflects what is truly going on out there in the space. In addition to tracking on legacy approaches to API deployment like enterprise API gateways, or using an open-source API frameworks, I am also trying to understand the realities of scraping data for deployment of APIs, and new solutions from API platforms like <a href="https://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">APISpark</a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/1jLr1Pf">StrongLoop</a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/1wWkDwH">Orchestrate.io</a>, and <a href="https://bit.ly/1pKwOg9">Import.io</a>.
<p>When it comes to the realities of deploying an API, your data or content sources is likely to come from a myriad of file stores, databases, and other systems, and I&rsquo;m looking to explore as many of the as I possibly can. Todays exploration is focused on deploying an API, using Amazon S3 as a file store. I use Amazon S3 for all my heavy object storage which includes images, PDFs, XML, JSON and CSV data stores&mdash;it makes sense that someone companies would want to deploy APIs using their Amazon S3 stores.
<p><a href="https://bit.ly/1sgwGpq"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/api-spark/apispark-s3.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;m using APISpark as my API deployment platform, which allows me to first establish a datastore, which is mapped to a specific bucket within my Amazon S3. What I put into my buckets, and folders is up to me. I might use it to quickly provide access to my images, a folder of XML files, PDFs, or other resource. Once I have my datastore defined, I can deploy a simple web API using APISpark, which gives me all the expected features of an API&mdash;URL API endpoints, documentation, code samples, basic authentication (username / password), analytics, and much more.
<p>As with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/30/deploy-an-api-from-a-google-spreadsheet-using-apispark/">Google Spreadsheet to API example I wrote on Monday</a>, this scenario allows anyone who manages content and data, to easily organize it on S3, then deploy an API for access, with no IT or developer experience required. You might need to share images, files, or other content with another department within your company or organization, partners outside the corporate firewall, or maybe some 3rd party developers you have building a new website or mobile application.
<p>API deployment is getting easier, and cloud API service providers like APISpark are making API deployment something ANYONE can do&mdash;stop waiting for IT or developer resources! ;-)

        <span class="post-date">01 Jul 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-api-deployment-2.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
<p>As I continue my research the world of <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment</a>, I'm trying to distill the services, and tooling I come across, down into what I consider to be a common set of building blocks. My goal with identifying API deployment building blocks is to provide a simple list of what the moving parts are, that enable API providers to successfully deploy their services.
<p>Some of these building blocks overlap with other core areas of my research like <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">design</a>, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">management</a>, but I hope this list captures the basic building blocks of what anyone needs to know, to be able to follow the world of API deployment. While this post is meant for a wider audience, beyond just developers, I think it provides a good reminder for developers as well, and can help things come into focus. (I know it does for me!)
<p>Also there is some overlap between some of these building blocks, like API Gateway and API Proxy, both doing very similiar things, but labeled differently. Identifying building blocks for me, can be very difficult, and I'm constantly shifting definitions around, until I find a comfortable fit--so some of these will evolve, especially with the speed at which things are moving in 2014.

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-csv.png" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>CSV to API</strong>&nbsp;- Text files that contain comma separate values or CSVs, is one of the quickest ways to convert existing data to an API. Each row of a CSV can be imported and converted to a record in a database, and easily generate a RESTful interface that represents the data stored in the CSV. CSV to API can be very messy depending on the quality of the data in the CSV, but can be a quick way to breathe new life into old catalogs of data lying around on servers or even desktops. The easiest way to deal with CSV is to import directly into database, than generate API from database, but the process can be done at time of API creation.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Database to API</strong>&nbsp;- Database to API is definitely the quickest way to generate an API. If you have valuable data, generally in 2013, it will reside in a Microsoft, MySQL, PostgreSQL or other common database platform. Connecting to a database and generate a CRUD, or create, read, updated and delete API on an existing data make sense for a lot of reason. This is the quickest way to open up product catalogs, public directories, blogs, calendars or any other commonly stored data. APIs are rapidly replace database connections, when bundled with common API management techniques, APIs can allow for much more versatile and secure access that can be made public and shared outside the firewall.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Framework</strong>&nbsp;- There is no reason to hand-craft an API from scratch these days. There are numerous frameworks out their that are designed for rapidly deploying web APIs. Deploying APIs using a framework is only an option when you have the necessary technical and developer talent to be able to understand the setup of environment and follow the design patterns of each framework. When it comes to planning the deployment of an API using a framework, it is best to select one of the common frameworks written in the preferred language of the available developer and IT resources. Frameworks can be used to deploy data APIs from CSVs and databases, content from documents or custom code resources that allow access to more complex objects.</td>

<tr>
<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-proxy.png" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>API Gateway</strong>&nbsp;- API gateways are enterprise quality solutions that are designed to expose API resources. Gateways are meant to provide a complete solution for exposing internal systems and connecting with external platforms. API gateways are often used to proxy and mediate existing API deployments, but may also provide solutions for connecting to other internal systems like databases, FTP, messaging and other common resources. Many public APIs are exposed using frameworks, most enterprise APIs are deployed via API gateways--supporting much larger ideployments.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-proxy.png" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>API Proxy</strong>&nbsp;- API proxy are common place for taking an existing API interface, running it through an intermediary which allows for translations, transformations and other added services on top of API. An API proxy does not deploy an API, but can take existing resources like SOAP, XML-RPC and transform into more common RESTful APIs with JSON formats. Proxies provide other functions such as service composition, rate limiting, filtering and securing of API endpoints. API gateways are the preffered approach for the enterprise, and the companies that provide services support larger API deployments.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-connector" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>API Connector</strong>&nbsp;- Contrary to an API proxy, there are API solutions that are proxyless, while just allowing an API to connect or plugin to the advanced API resources. While proxies work in many situations, allowing APIs to be mediated and transformed into required interfaces, API connectors may be preferred in situations where data should not be routed through proxy machines. API connector solutions only connect to existing API implementations are easily integrated with existing API frameworks as well as web servers like Nginx.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-hosting" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Hosting</strong>&nbsp;- Hosting is all about where you are going to park your API. Usual deployments are on-premise within your company or data center, in a public cloud like Amazon Web Services or a hybrid of the two. Most of the existing service providers in the space support all types of hosting, but some companies, who have the required technical talent host their own API platforms. With HTTP being the transport in which modern web APIs put to use, sharing the same infrastructure as web sites, hosting APIs does not take any additional skills or resources, if you already have a web site or application hosting environment.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>API Versioning</strong>&nbsp;- There are many different approaches to managing different version of web APIs. When embarking on API deployment you will have to make a decision about how each endpoint will be versioned and maintained. Each API service provider offers versioning solutions, but generally it is handled within the API URI or passed as an HTTP header. Versioning is an inevitable part of the API life-cycle and is better to be integrated by design as opposed to waiting until you are forced to make a evolution in your API interface.</td>

<td width="60" align="center" valign="top"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-documents.png" alt="" width="50" align="left" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Documentation</strong>&nbsp;- API documentation is an essential building block for all API endpoints. Quality, up to date documentation is essential for on-boarding developers and ensuring they successfully integrate with an API. Document needs to be derived from quality API designs, kept up to date and made accessible to developers via a portal. There are several tools available for automatically generting documentation and even what is called interactive documentation, that allows for developers to make live calls against an API while exploring the documentation. API documentation is part of every API deployment.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Code Samples</strong>&nbsp;- Second to documentation, code samples in a variety of programming languages is essential to a successful API integration. With quality API design, generating samples that can be used across multiple API resources is possible. Many of the emerging API service providers and the same tools that generate API documentation from JSON definitions can also auto generate code samples that can be used by developers. Generation of code samples in a variety of programming languages is a requirement during API deployment.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Scraping</strong>&nbsp;- Harvesting or scraping of data from an existing website, content or data source. While we all would like content and data sources to be machine readable, sometimes you have just get your hands dirty and scrape it. While I don't support scraping of content in all scenarios, and business sectors, but in the right situations scraping can provide a perfectly acceptable content or data source for deploying an API.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Container</strong>&nbsp;- The new virtualization movement, lead by Docket, and support by Amazon, Google, Red Hat, Microsoft, and many more, is providing new ways to package up APIs, and deploy as small, modular, virtualized containers.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Github</strong>&nbsp;- Github provides a simple, but powerful way to support API deployment, allowing for publsihing of a developer portal, documentation, code libraries, TOS, and all your supporting API business building blocks, that are necessary for API effort. At a minimum Github should be used to manage public code libraries, and engage with API consumers using Github's social features.</td>

<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Terms of Use / Service</strong>&nbsp;- Terms of Use provide a legal framework for developers to operate within. They set the stage for the business development relationships that will occur within an API ecosystem. TOS should protect the API owners company, assets and brand, but should also provide assurances for developers who are building businesses on top of an API. Make sure an APIs TOS pass insepection with the lawyers, but also strike a healthy balance within the ecosystem and foster innovation.</td>

<p>Spreadsheet are the most used datastore in business. When Google came out with their web-based spreadsheet, it was a game changer (for those who have access), when it came to managing, collaborating and sharing small data sets.
<p>When it comes to data management, not all of us live in the world of big data, and spreadsheets are a quick and dirty data store that gets the job done.  As the web was maturing, Google saw an opportunity, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs">launched the labs version of Google Spreadsheets in mid 2006</a>, bringing spreadsheets into the web 2.0 era of the Internet. In 2014, the next step, in the evolution of the spreadsheet, is to be able to plug spreadsheets directly into the API economy, allowing spreadsheet data stewards to make their valuable content and data available to web, mobile and Internet of things (Iot) developers via simple web APIs.
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/gdata/samples/spreadsheet_sample">Google Spreadsheets allows for accessing data via a JSON feed natively</a>, and I wrote about adding an API, plus management layer on top of a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/deploy-api-public-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">public</a> or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/12/deploy-api-private-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">private</a> Google Spreadsheet, but there is also an instant, cloud-based approach to deploying an API from Google Spreadsheet, using <a href="https://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">APISpark</a>. Restlet has taken their open source REST framework, launched it as a service, and opened up the possibility for anyone to deploy an API, from an existing Google Spreadsheet&mdash;no coding necessary.
<p><a href="https://bit.ly/1sgwGpq"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-spreadsheet-api.png" alt="" width="500" /></a>
<p>APISpark has provided both the API deployment, plus API management layer, spreadsheet owners will need. This is an important evolution in the API economy, because it allows people who are actually managing vital data to securely expose it, for use in applications, without needing any developer or IT resources. This will bring data stewards closer to the actual people who need their data, whether it be internally between systems or business units, externally with partners, or even publicly for anyone looking to use a dataset on a website or application.
<p>A lot can be lost in translation, when a dataset has to go through IT, or developers before it can be made available as an API, not to mention the cost savings in being able to cut out the middleman. If we can equip any small business, enterprise, non-profit, or government data steward, who spends their day managing content and data in spreadsheets, with the ability to securely expose, and easily manage APIs from those data sources&mdash;imagine the fuel that will be fed to the API economy.
<p>I am working on other walk-throughs, demonstrating how to expose datasets managed in <a href="https://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">Google Spreadsheets, as APIs, using APISpark.</a> When I get up, I will publish here on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, as well as on my <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API Deployment research site</a>, for folks to learn from.

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/legos.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;m working the great feedback we've had on <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, an adding everything to the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">Github issues for consideration in the next version</a>. Today I&rsquo;m spending a little time thinking through the big picture of APIs.json, and some of the building blocks I'd like to see reflected when API providers generate their APIs.json.
<p>Each API listed in an APIs.json has what we are calling: <em>"Properties Elements&rdquo;.</em> The properties element is a collection, with two values: <em>type and url.</em> While we provide you with a base set of property element types you can reference:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Swagger</li>
<li>RAML</li>
<li>Blueprint</li>
<li>WADL</li>
<li>WSDL</li>
<li>TermsOfService</li>
<li>InterfaceLicense</li>
<li>StatusPage</li>
<li>Pricing</li>
<li>Forums</li>
<li>AlertsTwitterHandle</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is to continue providing, &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; types that we recognize, while also leaving properties elements, being as organic as possible&mdash;meaning you can define your own references, and tell the story of why these are important building blocks in your own API strategy. We will continue adding the best properties we see being used, to the APIs.json spec.
<p>To prepare for the next version of APIs.json, I want to have the next list of reserved property types. Working from my list of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building blocks</a> I&rsquo;ve identified X I&rsquo;d like to see in the next version:
<ul class="mainlist">

<p>These are the building blocks I think are important to API operations. Currently all of these will be links to human readable pages, within an APIs developer portal, but eventually I envision all of these potentially being machine readable.
<p>I know, this is a big vision, but I intend to make it a reality. The first machine readable element on this list is the InterfaceLicense, which will reference the <a href="http://apicommons.org/add-apis.html">machine readable JSON manifest</a> for <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>.
<p>Next on the list is TermsOfService, which I will be using <a href="https://tosdr.org/">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read&rsquo;s</a> machine readable format, and applying it to the world of APIs. If there are any types you&rsquo;d like to see in the next version of APIs.json, head over to the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues/44">Github issue I created for this discussion</a>, and make sure it is on the list.

<p>My research for API Evangelist <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">spans 50+ projects</a>, but my core research is focused on seven projects in&nbsp;<a href="http://101.apievangelist.com">API 101</a>, <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com">history</a>, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a> and <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>. In each of these areas, I evaluate who the key players (companies and individuals) are, and the tools and services they produce.
<p>Using my own, custom developed system, I monitor these key players, in all of the research areas, consuming blog posts, tweets, code commits, and much more, trying to establish a deep awareness in each of these fundamental layers of the API economy.  The goal of my monitoring is to help me in producing blog posts (short form), and white papers (long form), while generating valuable analysis for my research, and increasing my own understanding and awareness of the API economy.
<p>I have already produced white papers for <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/whitepapers/api-evangelist-api-101-white-paper-2.png">API 101</a>, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/whitepapers/api-evangelist-white-papers-history-of-apis-2.png">History of APIs</a>, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/whitepapers/api-deployment-pdf-cover-3.png">API Deployment</a>, and <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/whitepapers/api-evangelist-api-providers-guide-api-management-white-paper.png">API Management</a>, and I just now finished one for <a href="https://bit.ly/1pFDGeP">API Design</a>. As with all of my research projects, and the resulting white papers, they are a work in progress, and meant to be a living snapshot of my research. I generate this white paper using the same tools I publish my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">API design research to Github</a>. My CMS lets me format the static content, while also pulling dynamic content from my tracking system(s), and rolls it up into single PDF white paper, you can take with you and learn about the world of API design--it isn't perfect, but provides a good summary of my research.
<p>The other white papers I've produced are all due for an update, but first I need to focus on producing the first version white paper for API discovery, and integration, both areas that are extremely relevant, fast moving layers of the API economy. Looking at the date on my other white papers, June 2013, it seems that summer is a good time to hibernate and produce these new, long form snapshots of my ongoing research into the API economy.

        <span class="post-date">28 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-comment-bubbles.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>We are still in the infancy of the API economy, and now with barely 14 years of evolving web API design, we are only just now developing the languages we will need to communicate around APIs throughout their lifecycle, from the first mock of the API resource, to monitoring of a production API in the wild, or making available to a new breed of API search engines.
<p>There has long been standards for describing APIs, such as WSDL for SOAP, and WADL for web APIs, but these formats would never actually enable the meaningful interactions around APIs that it would take to find widespread adoption. WSDL was too programmatic, and heavy handed, while WADL never possessed the incentives for API providers to take the time to define their APIs using the heavy XML format.
<p>It wasn't until early 2011, we would see the first signs of a meaningful language for defining web APIs, that would enable us to have productive conversations, and take action around our API designs. In February 2011, <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/">online word meaning and definition site Wordnik</a>, launched a <a href="http://blog.wordnik.com/calling-all-developers-check-out-our-new-developer-site">new API developer portal, complete with a new way to document APIs</a>, that was interactive, and allowed developers to make live API calls, while learning about an API. In an effort to keep their API documentation up to date, Wordnik has also established a new way to not just document and communicate with an API, but allow us to actually have a shared conversation about the actual design of the API itself.
<p>Later on that year, API management provider Mashery emulated Wordnik's approach, and <a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/mashery-unveils-next-generation-of-api-documentation-1541728.htm">launched their I/O Docs</a>. Immediately after, in August 2011, <a href="http://blog.wordnik.com/wordnik-news-swagger-jobs-nosql-now">Wordnik formally launched their approach to defining APIs</a>, generate interactive documentation, and server or client side code&mdash;which they called <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a>. Over the next two years the Swagger ecosystem would grow and evolve, producing new versions, tooling, and implementations of both private and public API implementations.
<p>During this time, the concept of API design would expand, with tech giants like Google establishing their own approach, which they called <a href="https://developers.google.com/discovery/">Google Discovery</a>, and we would see a new breed of API design service providers emerge with <a href="https://apiary.io">Apiary.io</a>. By March 2013, Apiary had <a href="https://blog.apiary.io/2013/03/28/New-API-Blueprint-Format-Roll-Out/">launched their own API definition format called API Blueprint</a>, which allowed API providers to define an API using markdown, and iterate on the design using Apiary.io services. Apiary moved the incentives for defining APIs in a machine readable format earlier on in the lifecycle. Now we didn't just generate machine readable definitions to deploy server code, or generate interactive docs and client side code, we would do it before we actually deployed the API, allowing us to mock our API designs, and collaborate around designing the actual API prior to deployment.
<p>Then by the end of 2013, <a href="http://blogs.mulesoft.org/raml-web-tooling-unleashed/">we'd see another API definition language emerge, this time from enterprise technology provider Mulesoft</a>, called <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>. This new approach to defining APIs, would use YAML to produce a machine readable, yet human friendly way to describe APIs. Now we had four new ways to describe our APIs, and as we push into 2014, we have a wealth of tooling, services, and a selection of maturing API design editors to choose from when planning and designing our APIs.
<p>I feel like we are just moving from infancy, into the toddler phase of communicating throughout the web API lifecycle. We now have several languages to choose from, we just have to work hard to educate people that they exist, help them become fluent, and expand the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">incentives for generating machine readable definitions for our APIs</a>. In the next year, I predict we will see an increased adoption of the leading API definition formats, new tooling and services that helps us design, deploy, manage, monetize, evangelize and integrate with APIs that are driving the API, and app economy--driven from a central, machine readable API definition.

        <span class="post-date">27 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://bit.ly/1sgwGpq"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/api-spark/restlet-apispark.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for common patterns that are working within the API space, and shine light on them, work to understand why they work, so that others can emulate these successful patterns in the space. One approach I&rsquo;ve seen work well, in many situations, is a combination of open source and a Platform as a Service (PaaS), and I&rsquo;m going to highlight the implementation of this model by one of the API Evangelist partners&mdash;<a href="https://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">Restlet / APISpark</a>.
<p><strong>Open Source For Developers</strong><br /> First and foremost, Restlet is an open source web API framework, that any developer can download, and install to deliver their own API. The community benefits from this, Restlet benefits from this&mdash;open source API tooling is a fundamental building block for all of this to work. Many companies feel that open sourcing their core platform is just giving away their intellectual property, when in reality many consumers of your software won&rsquo;t have the resources to implement on their own, and will still need consulting resources to get the solution off the ground.
<p><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS) For Everyone</strong><br /> If you want the power of Restlet, but don&rsquo;t have the time or resources to download and install, and you just want to get up and running with APIs, Restlet provides a PaaS version of Restlet, called APISpark.  Using APISpark, anyone can deploy an API from new or existing data or file stores--no coding resources necessary. APISpark is a natural companion for Restlet, providing an out-of-the-box web API framework, that anyone can put to use--providing a viable commercial layer built on top of the open source Restlet.&nbsp;
<p><strong>Professional Services For Everything Else</strong><br /> Of course, at any stage of development, whether you are looking to put Restlet or APISpark to work, there are professional services to help you achieve your goals. The Restlet team provides professional services, commercial licensing, and other opportunities to get the skills and resources you need to make your API deployment successful. Since Restlet is open source, this isn&rsquo;t limited to the Restlet professional services team itself, a community has evolved around the Restlet platform, allowing for community options when looking for assistance with any API deployment.
<p>I believe the Restlet business model is significant, and represents the future of the API economy. It makes sense to have your core technology be open source, and allow the community to benefit from the availability of open tooling, as well as the platform to benefit from community driven software development.  This model acknowledges that not every will have the time and resources to deploy on their own, and provides a PaaS version, as well as the required paid support necessary to find success with any API deployment.
<p>Open API frameworks are essential to the success of the API economy, and Restlet is a better product because its source code is open. They have acknowledged that there is plenty of money to be made around the platform version of Restlet (APISpark), and professional services surrounding both platforms. I believe this formula is fundamental to the API economy working, and is something other API infrastructure should look to follow.
<p><em><strong>Disclosure: </strong>Restlet / APISpark is an API Evangelist partner.</em>

<p>I had several folks point me to the <a href="https://developer.nest.com/documentation/nest-api-intro">Nest API</a> release the other day. I enjoy this, because I&rsquo;m not always the fastest in finding news&mdash;eventually I&rsquo;ll find it, but I rely on my human API monitoring network, just as much as my algorithmic API monitoring network, to bring stories to my attention. I&rsquo;m still reviewing the Nest API release, but one thing that stood out to me, was how real-time is baked into the API by default, and specifically using <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a>.
<p>The Nest API documentation states:
<blockquote><em>Use the official Firebase client libraries (Web, iOS, Java, and Node), which allow you to synchronize your data with a subscription-based, near-real time platform. As you develop your client, you'll find these resources useful: Firebase Data Structure, Reading and Writing data.</em></blockquote>
<p>Nest also provides options, if you can&rsquo;t use the Firebase library (not sure why this would be):
<blockquote><em>In cases where the platform you're developing your integration on has no available Firebase library, you may want to use REST or REST Streaming instead.</em></blockquote>
<p>I track on <a href="https://bit.ly/11RorBM">real-time technology</a> like Firebase as part of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">API trends research</a>, and much like other trends like <a title="aggregation" href="https://bit.ly/11RojT4">aggregation</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/19Li6cS/">reciprocity</a>,&nbsp;I think we&rsquo;ll start seeing these trending layers baked into API operations by default. I&rsquo;ve seen <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">APIs reference default API reciprocity, using platforms like Zapier</a>, and I think we&rsquo;ll see more APIs adopt real-time frameworks by default in the future.
<p><a href="https://www.firebase.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/firebase/firebase-logo.png" alt="" width="190" align="right" /></a>
<p>API providers need to focus on what they do best, providing API access to their valuable data, content and other programmatic resources. It is wise for providers to leverage existing providers to deliver real-time, aggregation, reciprocity, <a href="https://bit.ly/10sgWQI">voice</a>, and other complimentary API layers. I will continue to keep my eye out for how APIs are providing a much fuller stack of resources for developers, using their own resources, while also augmenting with other leading technology platforms.

<p>I&rsquo;m not at Google I/O this week, enjoying some downtime in SoCal, but I am watching some of the news coming out of the event. One thing I noticed, was the addition of monitoring to the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google Developer Console</a>, where&nbsp;Google is slowly working their <a href="https://www.stackdriver.com">StackDriver acquisition</a> into their fast growing API driven, cloud development platform.
<p>You have to request access to the new monitoring services, and Google will open up "Stackdriver's monitoring capabilities available to select Google Cloud trusted testers at no charge&rdquo;. Wile Stackdriver is about monitoring your cloud infrastructure, it also provides <a href="http://www.stackdriver.com/announcing-endpoint-monitoring/">granular level, API endpoint monitoring solutions</a> that you can use to monitor the health of the API resources you depend on in your apps.
<p>When Google makes a move to support a specific feature across its world of APIs, I take notice. Much like when <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/03/14/google-api-access-with-oauth-20/">Google adopted OAuth 2.0 across all APIs</a>, I think their move to provide monitoring services, is a sign that monitoring of the resources you depend is going mainstream--something all web, mobile and Iot API resource providers need to have in place by default in 2014.

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-editor.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about API design lately, the services and tooling coming from Apiary, RAML and Swagger, and wanted to explore some thoughts around what I would consider to be killer features for the killer API design editor.  Some of these thoughts are derived from the features I&rsquo;ve seen in Apiary and RAML editor, and most recently the Swagger Editor, but I&rsquo;d like to *riff* on a little bit and play with what could be the next generation of features.
<p>While exploring my dream API design editor, I&rsquo;d like to walk through each group of features, organized around my indentations and objectives around my API designs.
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong><br />When kicking off the API design process, I want to be able to jumpstart the API design lifecycle from multiple sources. There will be many times that I want to start from a clean slate, but many times I will be working from existing patterns.
<ul>
<li><strong>Blank Canvas -</strong> I want to start with a blank canvas, no patterns to follow today, I&rsquo;m painting my masterpiece.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Import Existing File -</strong> I have a loose API design file laying around, and I want to be able to open, import and get to work with it, in any of the formats.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Fork From Gallery </strong>- I want to fork one of my existing API designs, that I have stored in my API design taller (I will outline below).&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Import From API Commons -</strong> Select an existing API design pattern from API Commons and import into editor, and API design gallery.</li>
</ul>
<p>My goals in getting started with API design, will be centered around re-use the best patterns across the API space, as well as my own individual or company API design gallery. We are already mimicking much of this behavior, we just don&rsquo;t have a central API design editor for managing these flows.
<p><strong>Editing My API Design</strong><br />Now we get to the meat of the post, the editor. I have several things in mind when I&rsquo;m actually editing a single API definition, functions I want, actions I want to take around my API design. These are just a handful of the editor specific features I&rsquo;d love to see in my perfect API design editor.
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Lingual -</strong> I want my editor to word with API definitions in API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger. I prefer to edit my API designs in JSON, but I know many people I work with will prefer markdown or YAML based, and my editor needs to support fluid editing between all popular formats.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Internationalization - How will I deal with making my API resources available to developers around the world? Beyond API definition langugages, how do I actually make my interfaces accessible, and understood by consuers around the glob.e</li>
<li><strong>Dictionary - </strong>I will outline my thoughts around a central dictionary below, but I want my editor to pull from a common dictionary, providing a standardized language that I work from, as well as my company when designing interfaces, data models, etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Annotation -</strong> I want to be able to annotate various aspects of my API designs and have associated notes, conversation around these elements of my design.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Highlight</strong> - Built in highlighting would be good to support annotations, but also just reference various layers of my API designs to highlighting during conversations with others, or even allowing the reverse engineer of my designs, complete with the notes and layers of the onions for others to follow.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Source View -</strong> A view of my API design that allows me to see the underlying markdown, YAML, or JSON and directly edit the underlying API definition language.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>GUI View - </strong>A visual view of my API design, allowing for adding, editing and removing elements in an easy GUI interface, no source view necessary for designing APIs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Interactive View -</strong> A rendered visual view of my API, allowing me to play with either my live API or generated mock API, through interactive documentation within my editors.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Save To Gallery -</strong> When I&rsquo;m done working with my API designs, all roads lead to saving it to my gallery, once saved to my working space I can decide to take other actions.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Suggestions -</strong> I want my editor to suggest the best patterns available to me from private and public sources. I shouldn't ever design my APIs in the dark.</li>
</ul>
<p>The API design editor should work like most IDE&rsquo;s we see today, but keep it simple, and reflect extensibility like <a href="https://atom.io/">GIthub&rsquo;s Atom editor</a>. My editor should give me full control over my API designs, and enable me to take action in many pre-defined or custom ways one could imagine.
<p><strong>Taking Action </strong> <br />My API designs represent the truth of my API, at any point within its lifecycle, from initial conception to deprecation. In my perfect editor I should be able to take meaningful actions around my API designs. For the purposes of this story I&rsquo;m going to group actions into some meaningful buckets, that reflect the expanding areas of the API lifecycle. You will notice the four areas below, reflect the primary areas I track on via API Evangelist.
<p><strong>Design Actions</strong><br />Early on in my API lifecycle, while I&rsquo;m crafting new designs, I will need to take action around my designs. Designs actions will help me iterate on designs before I reach expensive deployment and management phases.
<ul>
<li><strong>Mock Interface - </strong>With each of my API designs I will need to generate mock interfaces that I can use to play with what my API will deliver. I will also need to share this URL with other stakeholders, so that they can play with, and provide feedback on my API interface.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Copy / Paste - </strong>API designs will evolve and branch out into other areas. I need to be able to copy / paste or fork my API designs, and my editor, and API gallery should keep track of these iterations so I don&rsquo;t have to. The API space essentially copy and pastes common patterns, we just don&rsquo;t have a formal way of doing it currently.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Email Share - </strong>I want to easily share my API designs via email with other key stakeholders that will be part of the API lifecycle. Ideally I wouldn&rsquo;t be emailing around the designs themselves, just pointers to the designs and tools for interacting within the lifecycle.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Social Share - </strong>Sometimes the API design process all occur over common social networks, and in some cases be very public. I want to be able to easily share all my API designs via my most used social networks like Github, Twitter and LinkedIn.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration - </strong>API design should not be done in isolation, and should be a collaborative process with all key stockholders. I would like to to even have <a href="http://etherpad.org/">Etherpad style real-time interactions</a> around the design process with other users.</li>
</ul>
<p>API design actions are the first stop, in the expanding API design lifecycle. Being able to easily generate mocks, share my interfaces and collaborate with other stakeholders. Allowing me to quickly, seamlessly take action throughout the early design cycles will save me money, time and resources early on&mdash;something that only become more costly and restrictive later on in the lifecycle.
<p><strong>Deployment Actions </strong><br />Next station in the API design lifecycle, is being able to deploy APIs from my designs. Each of the existing API definition formats provide API deployment solutions, and with the evolution in cloud computing, we are seeing even more complete, modular ways to take action around your API designs.
<ul>
<li><strong>Server</strong> - With each of my API designs, I should be able to generate server side code in the languages that I use most. I should be able to register specific frameworks, languages, and other defining aspects of my API server code, then generate the code and make available for download, or publish using Github and FTP.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Container</strong> - Cloud computing has matured, producing a new way of deploying very modular architectural resources, giving rise to a new cloud movement, being called containers.  Container virtualization will do for APIs, what APIs have done for companies in the last 14 years. Containers provide a very defined, self-contained way of deploying APIs from API design blueprints, ushering a new ay of deploy API resources in coming years.</li>
</ul>
<p>I need help to deploy my APIs, and with container solutions like <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, I should have predefined packages I can configure with my API designs, and deploy using popular container solutions from Google, Amazon, or other coud provider.
<p><strong>Management Actions </strong><br />After I deploy an API I will need to use my API definitions as a guide for an increasing number of areas of my management process, not just the technical, but the business and politics of my API operations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Generating of interactive API documentation is what kicked off the popularity of API design, and importance of API definitions. Swagger provider the Swagger UI, and interactive, hands-on way of learning about what an API offered, but this wasn&rsquo;t the only motivation&mdash;providing up to date documentation as well, added just the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">incentives API providers needed to generate machine readable documentation</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong> - Second to API documentation, providing code samples, libraries, and SDKS is one of the best ways you can eliminate friction when on boarding new API users. API definitions provide a machine readable set of instructions, for generating the code that is necessary throughout the API management portion of the API lifecycle.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong> - JavaScript provides a very meaningful way to demonstrate the value of APis, and embeddable JavaScript should always be part of the API lifecycle. Machine readable API definitions can easily generate visualizations that can be used in documentation, and other aspects of the API lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>I predict, with the increased adoption of machine readable API formats like API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, we will see more layers of the API management process be expanded on, further automating how we manage APis.
<p><strong>Discovery Actions </strong><br />Having your APIs found, and being able to find the right API design for integration, are two sides of an essential coin in the API lifecycle. We are just now beginning to get a handle on what is need when it comes to API discovery.
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> - </strong>I should be able to organize API designs into groupings, and publish an APIs.json file for these groups. API designs should be able to be organized in multiple groups, organized by domain and sub-domain.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong><a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a> -</strong> Thanks to Oracle, the copyright of API of API definitions will be part of the API lifecycle. I want the ability to manage and publish all of my designs to the API Commons, or any other commons for sharing of API designs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The discovery of APIs has long been a problem, but is just now reaching the critical point where we have to start develop solutions for not just finding APIs, but also understanding what they offer, and the details of of the interface, so we can make sense of not just the technical, but business and political decisions around API driven resources.
<p><strong>Integration Actions</strong><br /> Flipping from providing APIs to consuming APIs, I envision a world where I can take actions around my API designs, that focus on the availability, and integration of valuable API driven resources.  As an API provider, I need as much as assistance as I can, to look at my APIs from an external perspective, and being able to take action in this area will grow increasingly important.
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Using my machine readable API definitions, I should be able to publish testing definitions, that allow the execution of common API testing patterns. I&rsquo;d love to see providers like SmartBear, Runscope, APITools, and API Metrics offer services around the import of API design generated definitions.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - Just like API testing, I want to be able to generate definition that allow for the monitoring of API endpoints. My API monitoring tooling should allow for me to generate standard monitoring definitions, and import and run them in my API monitoring solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that API integration is the fastest growing area of the AP space, second only to API design itself. Understanding how an API operates, from an integrators perspective is valuable, not just to the integrator, but also the provider. I need to be thinking about integration issues early on in the API design lifecyle to minimize costly changes downstream.
<p><strong>Custom Actions</strong><br /> I&rsquo;ve laid out some of the essential actions I&rsquo;d like to be able to take around my API definitions, throughout the API lifecycle. I expect the most amount of extensibility from my API design editor, in the future, and should be able to extend in any way that I need.
<ul>
<li><strong>Links</strong> - I need a dead simple way to take an API design, and publish to a single URL, from within my editor. This approach provides the minimum amount of extensibility I will need in the API design lifecycle.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> - I will need to run JavaScript that I write against all of my API designs, generating specific results that I will need throughout the API design process. My editor should allow me to write, store and execute JavaScript against all my API designs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Marketplace</strong> - There should be a marketplace to find other custom actions I can take against my API designs. I want a way to publish my API actions to the marketplace, as well as browse other API actions, and add them to my own library.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ve reached a point where using API definitions like API Blueprint, RAML, and Swagger are common place, and being able to innovate around what actions we take throughout the API design lifecycle will be critical to the space moving forward, and how companies take action around their own APIs.
<p><strong>API Design Gallery</strong><br /> In my editor, I need a central location to store and manage all of my API designs. I&rsquo;m calling this a gallery, because I do not want it only to be a closed off repository of designs, I want to encourage collaboration, and even public sharing of common API design patterns. I see several key API editor features I will need in my API design gallery.
<ul>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - I need to be able to search for API designs, based upon their content, as well as other meta data I assign to my designs. I should be able to easily expose my search criteria, and assist potential API consumers in finding my API designs as well.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Import</strong> - I should be able to import any API design from a local file, or provide a public URL and generate local copy of any API design. Many of my Api designs will be generated from an import of existing definition.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong> - I want the API editor of the future to track all versioning of my API designs. Much like managing the code around  my API, I need the interface definitions to be versioned, and the standard feature set for managing this process.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Groups</strong> - I will be working on many API designs, will various stakeholders in the success of any API design. I need a set of features in my API design editor to help me manage multiple groups, and their access to my API designs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Domains</strong> - Much like the Internet itself, I need to organize my APIs by domain. I have numerous domains which I manage different groups of API resources. Generally I publish all of my API portals to Github under a specific domain, or sub-domain&mdash;I would like this level of control in my API design editor.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - Github plays a central role in my API design lifecycle. I need my API design editor to help me manage everything, via public and private Github repository. Using the Github API, my API design editor should be able to store all relevant data on Github&mdash;seamlessly.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>Diff</strong> - What are the differences between my API designs? I would like to understand the difference between each of my API resource types, and versions of each API designs. It might be nice if I could see the difference between my API designs, and other public APIs I might consider as competitors.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Public</strong> - The majority of my API designs will be public, but this won&rsquo;t be the case with every designer. API designers should have the control over whether or not their API designs are public or private.</li>
</ul>
<p>My API design gallery will be the central place i work from. Once I reach a critical mass of designs, I will have many of the patterns I need to design, deploy and manage my APIs. It will be important for me to have access to import the best patterns from public repositories like API Commons. To evolve as an API designer, I need to easily create, store, and evolve my own API designs, while also being influenced by the best patterns available in the public domain.
<p><strong>Embeddable Gallery </strong><br />Simple visualization can be an effective tool in helping demonstrate the value an API delivers. I want to be able to manage open, API driven visualizations, using platforms like D3.js. I need an arsenal of embeddable, API driven visualizations to help tell the store of the API resources I provide, give me a gallery to manage them.
<ul>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - I want to be able to search the meta data around the API embeddable tools I develop. I will have a wealth of graphs, charts, and more functional, JavaScript widgets I generate.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong> - Give me a way to group, and organize my embeddable tools. I want to be able to organize, group and share my embeddable tools, not just for my needs, but potentially to the public as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>A picture is worth a thousand words, and being able to easily generate interactive visualizations, driven by API resources, that can be embedded anywhere is critical to my storytelling process. I will use embeddable tools to tell the story of my API, but my API consumers will also use these visualizations as part of their efforts, and hopefully develop their own as well.
<p><strong>API Dictionary </strong><br />I need a common dictionary to work from when designing my APIs. I need to use consistent interface names, field names, parameters, headers, media types, and other definitions that will assist me in providing the best API experience possible.
<ul>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - My dictionary should be available to me in any area of my API design editor, and in true IDE style, while I&rsquo;m designing. Search of my dictionary, will be essential to my API design work, but also to the groups that I work with.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Schema.org </strong>- There are plenty of existing patterns to follow when defining my APIs, and my editor should always assist me in adopting, and reusing any existing pattern I determine as relevant to my API design lifecycle, like <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Dublin Core</strong> - How do I define the metadata surrounding my API designs? My editor should assist me to use common metadata patterns available like <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Media Types</strong> - The results of my API should conform to existing document representations, when possible. Being able to explore the existing media types available while designing my API would help me emulate existing patterns, rather than reinventing the wheel each time I design an API.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Custom</strong> - My dictionary should be able to be driven by existing definitions, or allow me to import and and define my own vocabulary based upon my operations. I want to extend my dictionary to meet the unique demands of my API design lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want my API design process to be driven by a common dictionary that fits my unique needs, but borrows from the best patterns already available in the public space. We already emulate many of the common patterns we come across, we just don&rsquo;t have any common dictionary to work from, enforcing healthy design via my editor.
<p><strong>An Editor For Just My Own API Design Process</strong> <br />This story has evolved over the last two weeks, as I spent time in San Francisco, discussing API design, then spending a great deal of time driving, and thinking about the API design lifecycle. This is all part of my research into the expanding world of <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">API design</a>, which will result in a white paper soon, and my intent is to just shed some light on what might be some of the future <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks of the API design space</a>.  My thoughts are very much based in my own selfish API design needs, but based upon what i&rsquo;m seeing in the growing API design space.
<p><strong>An Editor For A Collective API Design Process </strong><br />With this story, I intend to help keep the API design process a collaborative, and when relevant a public affair. I want to ensure we work from existing patterns that are defined in the space, and as we iterative and evolve APIs, we collectively share our best patterns. You should not just be proud of your API designs, and willing to share publicly, you should demonstrate the due diligence that went into your design, attribute the patterns you used to contribute to your designs, and share back your own interpretation&mdash;encouraging re-use and sharing further downstream.
<p><strong>What Features Would Be Part of Your Perfect API Design Editor</strong> <br />This is my vision around the future of API design, and what I&rsquo;d like to have in my editor&mdash;what is yours? What do you need as part of your API design process? Are API definitions part of the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; in your API lifecycle? I&rsquo;d love to hear what tools and services you think should be made available, to assist us in designing our APIs.

        <span class="post-date">23 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/Swift-Federal-Data-SDK"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/images/logos/labor.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>It is a common theme, that government of any kind, especially the US federal government is too slow when it comes to adopting new technology. While this may be a popular meme for anti-government crusaders, and is true in many areas of government, there are growing pockets of resistance across federal agencies, who are not just keeping up with the latest technology, but they are leading.
<p>An example of this is out of the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/">Department of Labor</a> (DOL), with their new <a href="https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/Swift-Federal-Data-SDK">Swift Federal Data SDK</a>, which provides a powerful SDK that allows you to work with multiple federal government data APIs, using the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift programming language</a>. Swift is only a couple weeks old, and DOL didn't miss a beat in getting a new SDK published on Github for developers to take advantage of.
<p>In my opinion, we can no longer use the tired old meme, that government is just too slow to adopt new technology. There are an increasing number of examples out there that prove otherwise. In the future when you want to criticize an agency for being to slow in their adoption of tech, don&rsquo;t tell the same old tired story&mdash;point to examples like what DOL and <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a> are up to, and incentivize the agencies to change in a positive way.

        <span class="post-date">18 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;m working through thoughts around a suggestion for future versions of&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json API discovery format</a>, and as I do with other things I&rsquo;m trying to make sense of, I wanted to write a blog post on API Evangelist. If you aren't familiar with the format, APIs.json is meant to be a machine readable JSON file that provides an overview and listing APIs available within a specific domain.
<p><strong>Authoritative APIs.json</strong><br /> This is an APIs.json that is made available in the root of a domain, that is providing detail on an API that is managed within the same domain. This use case is for API providers to list the APIs that they offer publicly.
<p><strong>Tribute APIs.json</strong><br /> There is an API you use, and want to see it indexed in an API search engine like APIs.io&mdash;so you create a tribute APIs.json. This APIs.json index is not done by the owner of the API, but by a fan, or outside contributor. Tributes will weave together the world of APIs, when providers do not have the time.
<p><strong>Facade APIs.json</strong><br /> There is an API you use, but doesn&rsquo;t have exactly the interface you would want. Some resourceful API architects will be building facades to existing, external API resources. In the API economy you do not settle if an API isn't exactly what you need. The remix able nature of APIs allow for extending by designing facades that transform and extend existing API resources.
<p><strong>Cache APIs.json</strong><br /> If I learned anything working in the federal government last year, it is that APIs can go away at any point. In the future there will be a need for cached versions of existing APIs, providing redundancy and access to some important data and content.
<p><strong>Aggregate APIs.json</strong><br /> In fast growing areas of the API economy, we are seeing API aggregation trends, with sectors like social, media, cloud, financial, analytics, and other areas that have matured, and users are depending on potentially multiple API platforms.
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-api-discovery.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p><strong>Derived APIs.json</strong><br /> I envision derived APis as just an evolution of tribute or facade, stating that I started with a certain API design, but have evolved it beyond what it once was. Not acknowledging where we got our API patterns is a darker side of the API space that needs to go away&mdash;let&rsquo;s be honest about where we learned our patterns and give a nod to these sources.
<p>In the API economy, I think there will be multiple types of APIs that are deployed. As APIs proliferate, if the industry focuses on interoperability and reuse, there will be more types of APIs than the single API provider and APIs.json will help us keep tabs on this.
<p>Not all API providers will have time, desire and the access to resources to publish their APIs.json, and the augmentation, replication and other possible derivatives that will emerge to organically expand on existing patterns.
<p>Right now we are working on just stabilizing the latest release of APIs.json, so that people can get to work on publishing their own APIs.json. My goal with these thoughts is to just explore what is possible, and maybe, if successful some of these thoughts will be incorporated in future versions.

<p><a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a>, the cloud-based API integration services is raising the bar for the space by <a href="https://docs.apitools.com/2014/06/11/announcing-apitools-on-premise-with-open-source-release.html">introducing an open source, on-premise version of their API monitoring service</a>. APITools only launched this year, and because of consumer demands, they moved up the timeframe for open sourcing the platform, which was already on the roadmap.
<p>I&rsquo;d say after <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">API integration</a> services and tooling, for testing, monitoring, and transforming API calls is one of the fastest growing segments of the API space.

<p>The world of API integration service and tooling is rapidly expanding, and only time will tell whether developers prefer running in the cloud, or on-premise, and what features they are looking for, <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">something I've been documenting as I study what each of the companies offer</a>.
<p>I suspect, that along with other API design, deployment, and management tools we'll need a mix of freemium, open tiers, on-premise, and enterprise API integration services and tooling, to meet the demands of this fast growing segment that overlaps with both providing and consuming APIs.

        <p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/fda/open-fda-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>I recently reviewed a new API initiative from the Food &amp; Drug Administration, called <a href="https://open.fda.gov/">OpenFDA</a>. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">I gave a whole list of things that they did right when launching the API</a>, but one item that I thought was particularly interesting, was the actual interactive documentation for the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/">Drugs API endpoint</a>.
<p>I talk a lot about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/21/interactive-api-documentation-with-swagger/">interactive documentation for APIs</a>, something that has become commonplace, and a building block that developers are starting to expect. What is different about the OpenFDA Drug API, is that the interactive documentation provides a visual interface for building API calls, going beyond the interactive, and often very form based documentation that is commonly seen in other developer areas.
<p>Via the OpenFDA Drug API documentation you can actually build an API query by selecting from radio button values, which then updates the resulting URL query, some summary text, and generates a graph visualization of the resulting query. After building your filter, you can run the API query, and see the request and response, which is a common feature other interactive API documentation implementations.
<p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/fda/open-fda-endpoint-visualization.png" alt="" width="550" /></a>
<p>The addition of a visualization, that is driven by each endpoint is very interesting, and something I&rsquo;d like to see baked into the DNA of interactive API documentation.  Helping me build an API call, visualize and understand the value contained within an API has huge potential. Currently we have Swagger, API Blueprint, and RAML generated interactive documentation solution, which are pretty similar&mdash;I&rsquo;d love to see more visualizations integrated into future interactive documentation implementations.

<p>After <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/16/api-craft-san-francisco-wrapup-for-june-2014/">speaking at API Craft SF on Thursday</a>, I kept the API talk going with <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">two days of API car talk at API Days San Francisco</a>.  While there is a lot of focus specifically on the car itself, there was also a lot of talk beyond the auto at API Days San Francisco, which was dubbed "Disrupting the Car Industry and Driver Experience with APIs".
<p><strong>Public Transportation</strong><br /> In 2014, you just can&rsquo;t talk about disrupting the car industry, without including public transportation. With smart phones in our pockets, we need to get "smarter" about when and how we drive our cars, but also when should not drive our cars. Public transportation has to be part of the conversation when developers are looking to &ldquo;disrupt the car industry&rdquo;.
<p><strong>Bicycle Culture</strong><br /> I was pleased to also hear bicycles mentioned during several of the talks, and that developers should think about bicycle culture when developing apps. Many automobile owners are also bicyclists, and merging car and bike culture, expanding the opportunities to ride to work, large public events, or just for recreation, should be part of the consideration when developers are looking to &ldquo;disrupt the car industry&rdquo;.
<p><strong>Self-Driving Car Skepticism</strong><br /> It is easy to be captivated by the work coming out of Google around the self-driving car, but I was also so surprised to hear several folks express skepticism around whether or not the self-driving car will live up to the hype, and whether or not we even need the self-driving car at all&mdash;with investment around public transportation being a preferred alternative.
<p>When preparing for API Days, I expected the usual API crowd, educating people generally on the API opportunity, with a handful of high level car talks from people who have worked for the major car companies, or those working for aftermarket startups. This existed, but I was pleasantly surprised to see so much "out of the box" conversation as well.
<p>Seeing that the conversation wasn't just focused on automobiles, but also the wider world of transportation at <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">API Days San Francisco,</a> made me very hopeful for the future of APIs, and how they will be applied within the automobile industry.

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/ifthisthenthat/IFTTT-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>One interesting theme I heard at <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">API Days San Francisco</a>&nbsp;last week, was the concept of API reciprocity, or <a href="https://ifttt.com/">If This Then That</a>(IFTTT) moving into more niche areas. This edition of API Days was focused on "Disrupting the Car Industry and Driver Experience with APIs&rdquo;, and I heard several times, people saying, &ldquo;Its If This Then That for cars&rdquo;.
<p>After If This Then That put an iconographic face on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/28/from-etl-to-api-reciprocity-looking-at-20-service-providers/">classic practice of Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)</a>, and focused on not traditional database and IT system, but API driven software as a service (SaaS), I saw over <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">30 other providers</a> follow in their footsteps. It is my mission to understand how these companies are evolving the ETL world, and write about it across the API Evangelist network.
<p>In 2014, I think the concept has reached a maturity point, where reciprocity and interoperability between API driven platforms is being applied to niche areas. With the popularity of IFTTT and Zapier, in helping tech savvy users understand how they can take control over how data and content flow in our increasingly digital worlds, it makes total sense that startups would look to apply this successful pattern to niche areas like the automobile experience.
<p>While Zapier, IFTTT and many other reciprocity providers are providing general purpose recipes for keeping your online world in sync, there is a growing number of focused providers, like <a href="http://www.sortmybox.com/">SortMyInbox</a> for email, <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet Labs</a> for cloud computing, and <a href="http://roadrules.co/">RoadRules.io</a> which was present at API Days in San Francisco.
<p>I think this new breed of API focused ETL startups, delivering niche recipes of automation, interoperability and reciprocity in our digital worlds, will continue to expand. You will hear more startup pitches, where the founder says, &ldquo;Its like If This Then That for X&rdquo;.

        <span class="post-date">16 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/dropcam/dropcam.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>One of the mutiple requests to review APIs currently in my inbox, is from the camera platform <a href="https://www.dropcam.com">Dropcam</a>. Every email or tweet I get, asking me to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/12/12/an-api-evangelist-review-of-your-api/">review an API</a>, I at least click in to see what is happening, looking for that good story.&nbsp;
<p>Sometimes the API itself, can be good enough to be the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; that I tell a story about, but most often it is about a specific approach the API provider takes. Regardless, I look throughr all aspects of an API, sign up for an account, play with endpoints, look through documentation and code, and terms of service&mdash;trying to find any angle for a compelling story.
<p>When I clicked into <a href="https://www.dropcam.com/developers">Dropcam's developer area</a>, I can&rsquo;t sign up for the API, play with endpoints, review documentation and code, but I can look at terms of service! Dropcam asks that you apply to be part of their beta program, before you can look at or play with anything.
<p>Dropcam assures me that their API is RESTful and uses its verbs, with all endpoints using HTTPS, and requests and responses in JSON. Dropcam uses oAuth for authentication and authorization, showing that all the proper technology and security building blocks are in place--thing is I need to see for myself.
<p>I can understand putting an approval layer at the point someone wants to take their application public, but if someone owns a Dropcam, they should be able to signup and start hacking on their device and the supporting cloud infrastructure. With modern API management infrastructure you have the power to control what resources developers have access to, with identify the bad actors, without limiting who has access to learn about your platform.
<p>Most importantly it prevents people like me from just reviewing the endpoints, documentation and the real meat of the Dropcam developer program. I&rsquo;m not building an application, I just want to write a story about what is possible, and without playing with it I can&rsquo;t do that. I&rsquo;m not like many other tech journalists who will take a press release and rewrite it&mdash;I want to play!!
<p>So far, that is my review Dropcam. Sorry. ;-(

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/events/api-craft/san-francisco/api-craft-sf-june-2014.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>I participated in an <a href="https://www.meetup.com/API-Craft-San-Francisco/events/185583452/">API Craft meetup this last Thursday</a>, hosted by 3Scale in San Francisco. The gathering included Uri Sarid(<a href="https://twitter.com/usarid">@usarid</a>)&nbsp;representing <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>, Jakub Nesetril(<a href="https://twitter.com/jakubnesetril">@jakubnesetril</a>)&nbsp;on behalf of <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, Tony Tam(<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>) with his <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a>, and myself, discussing the fast growing world of API design.
<p>While there are other formats for defining APIs, API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger represent the leading API definition formats, tools, and services in the space right now. I assumed we'd be talking about each of the API definition formats, but the conversation was more about how we got here, and the motivations behind generating API descriptions.
<p>There are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">numerous reasons why API providers would want to generate API designs</a>, ranging from the ability to mock interfaces, to generating interactive documentation that helps onboard API consumers. Having this conversation is important, as not all API providers are generating API definitions, and many of those who do, do not understand all the benefits of have machine readable API definitions.
<p>Thank you to Emmanuel Paraskakis(<a href="https://twitter.com/manp">@manp</a>)&nbsp;who organized the meet up, <a href="https://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> for hosting and sponsoring the conversation, the beer (which included Stone IPA w00t!), and making it possible so the leaders in the space can discuss the increasingly relevant topic of API design, and share the insight with the San Francisco API audience.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/06/15/netflix-finally-shutters-support-for-public-api/">Netflix Finally Shutters Support For Public API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">15 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/netflix/netflix-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>Netflix officially announced they will be ending support for their public API. Its no surprise, as they <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">announced early in 2013 that they would longer accept new registrations for the API</a>.
<p>While I think that Netflix could have put more resources into their API, and fought harder to make their public API a success, I still consider Netflix to be one of API pioneers that we can learn from when crafting our own API strategy.
<p>While the public Netflix API was not a success, the internal and partner API strategy at Netflix was a success. APIs have allowed the company to scale into the cloud, grow internationally, and expand to sever over 1000 devices via their trusted partner network.
<p>In addition to the internal API success at Netflix, they have been amazing at sharing their knowledge and experience with the wider API community via their blog, conferences like <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>, and in books like <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021223.do">APIs: A Strategy Guide</a>, available on O'Reilly Publishing, written by Daniel Jacobsen, Greg Brail and Dan Woods.
<p>Another positive byproduct of Netflix API operation, is that the company has been prolific in open sourcing the technology that goes into the API stack. When you visit the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix">Netflix Github account</a>, you will find a wealth of open tooling that they have worked hard on, and opened up for public use.
<p>API success varies widely from company to company, sector to sector, and it doesn't always look like you think it will&mdash;this is part of the API experience. Just because Netflix doesn't reflect one vision of API success that open developers believed in, it doesn't mean Netflix as a whole was an API failure. There are plenty of lessons to learn from their public API failure, as well as their internal API success.

        <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2014</span>

<p>I&rsquo;m still extracting great examples of API design, deployment, and management, that other API providers can follow, from recent API projects out of our federal government, with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/08/18f-shows-what-is-possible-in-government-with-fbopen-api/">FBOpen</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">OpenFDA out of the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA).</a>
<p>This particular post is about the approach to establishing a feedback loop with consumers of the OpenFDA API. If you visit the<a href="https://open.fda.gov/"> OpenFDA portal,</a>&nbsp;you will find that API consumers can seek help via three self-service channels:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://github.com/FDA">GitHub</a></li>
<li><a href="https://opendata.stackexchange.com/search?q=openFDA">StackExchange</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23openfda">Twitter</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t get your question answered by searching through existing Github, StackExchange, and Twitter conversations, you have three ways to directly ask the OpenFDA team questions:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/ask?tags=openFDA">StackExchange</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/FDA">GitHub</a></li>
<li>Email</li>
</ul>
<p>What is notable (thanks Gray Brooks), is that OpenFDA uses existing services to establish the feedback loop with API consumers&mdash;meaning they use Github, StackExchange, and Twitter rather than rolling their own tool. OpenFDA understands that there are existing conversation that are already occurring on StackExchange, and developers are used to going here to find the answers they need.
<p>Additionally by stimulating the conversation on StackExchange and Twitter you are generating valuable social media and SEO exhaust that will help new consumers, potentially learn about the OpenFDA API, and how it is being used by developers.  This type of feedback loop doesn&rsquo;t just provide support for community, it establishes itself as the heartbeat of your API, showing that someone is home, and is there to support and listen.
<p>The best part is that using Twitter, StackExchange, and Github are free for public conversations, and take almost no time to setup. OpenFDA directly links to the form for asking a question on StackExchange, they don&rsquo;t for Github, but easily could. They also directly link to #OpenFDA hashtag to join existing conversations on StackExchange and Twitter, which is a pretty slick way to weave external searches into your API feedback loop.
<p>Lots of good patterns to follow, from the leading groups deploying APIs in the US federal government.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/06/09/the-edx-api/">The edX API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">09 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.edx.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/edx/edx-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>This post should tell you about how behind I am in my storytelling&mdash;this story is from an <a href="/admin/blog/google">event I attended in Arlington TX</a>, on April 30th, and May 1st. While in Arlington, I spoke to a group of professionals who were crafting an online data &amp; analytics course. A couple of the participants were from edX, the online course platform partnership between MIT, Harvard, UC Berkeley and other universities.
<p>Over the course of two days, I had a cance ask the question, where was the edX API? Seemed like an obvious question, to which <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/watsonemily">Emily Watson</a>, the program manager at edX, responded, &ldquo;Its on our roadmap&rdquo;!  An answer I get from many online companies, but Emily pulled up their roadmap on the wiki, and <a href="https://edx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OPENPROD/Open+edX+Public+Product+Roadmap">indeed it was on their roadmap</a>.
<p>I told Emily, I&rsquo;d review the edX platform, and provide some feedback, that they could incorporate into their strategy. This one is easy, and is my basic feedback for any company with an online website and/or application&mdash;you make everything currently available on your site or application, available via an API. A quick glance at edX, these would be:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Courses</strong> - The 175+ courses available on edX, should also be available in a machine readable format, via the edX API.</li>
<li><strong>Faculty &amp; Staff </strong>- The 400+ faculty and staff involved in producing edX courses should be available in a machine readable format, via the edX API.</li>
<li><strong>Schools &amp; Partners</strong>- All edX partners should be available in a machine readable format, via the edX API.</li>
</ul>
<p>You start with the low hanging fruit, by establishing three, simply designed web APIs for those already, publicly available resources, then move on to providing the essential business building blocks for any API:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Dedicated API Portal -</strong> Simple, dedicated portal for edX API integrations, that isn&rsquo;t just for developers. It should be easy enough for anyone to learn about the edX API, without too much technical detail front and center.</li>
<li><strong>Simple Landing Page -</strong> The home page of the edX API portal should be dead simple, explaining what the API does, providing easy one click access to get to whatever any API, or potential API consumer will need.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Registration </strong>- The edX API needs to be accessible 24/7, and developers should be able to register without approval, and at least get minimum access to the system to begin playing with resources, even if it takes approval to get higher levels of access. Modern <a href="https://bitly.com/13esk6Q+">API management solutions like 3Scale</a> work very well in managing this layer of access, and service composition.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive Documentation </strong>- The standard for all APIs in 2014 is to provide interactive documentation, making learning about an API, a hands on experience. There are some common approaches to defining an API using machine readable formats like <a href="https://bit.ly/1w9oKpq">Swagger</a>, which will automatically generate interactive documentation for consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Code Samples &amp; Libraries -</strong> Developers need all the help they can in getting up and running with an API, and right after interactive API documentation, code libraries and samples are critical to onboarding API consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Blog W/ RSS </strong>- An active blog, with RSS for syndication provides the necessary stories and resulting SEO that helps communicate the value an API offers, and keeps new and existing consumers in tune with API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter Presence - </strong>An active Twitter presence is common place for leading API platforms, and edX will need an active Twitter account to support its other communications, and support operations.</li>
<li><strong>Support Ticket System </strong>- An easy to use, trackable support system for the edX API platform will be essential to establishing a feedback loop with API consumers. Github issue management works very well, for an out of the box, API support ticket system for all public APis.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion Forum -</strong> Discussion forums are common place in APIs, and provide potential indirect, community support, that can help new and existing API consumers find what they are looking for. Don&rsquo;t limit yourself to a local discussion forum, there are SaaS solutions, as well as existing developer driven communities like Stack Overflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next make sure and cover the basic political building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Terms of Service -</strong> Provide simple, liberal terms of service that incentivize integrations and development.</li>
<li><strong>Content Licensing -</strong> Make sure all licensing for any content is explained front and center.</li>
<li><strong>Code Licensing -</strong> Clearly license all client side code samples, libraries and event potentially server side code for the API.</li>
<li><strong>API Licensing -</strong> Make sure the API definition is openly licensed, so that it can be re-used, re-mixed in many ways--consider putting into <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Branding Requirements -</strong> Provide clear direction when it comes to branding requirements around API integrations.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limits -</strong> Help developers understand what rate limits are in place to keep system stable, and what ways there are to get more access.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing -</strong> Are there any costs for API access? If there are, make sure and clearly explain what is free, and at what points do resources cost.</li>
<li><strong>Partner Tiers -</strong> Establish multiple layers of API access, allowing trusted partners to achieve higher rate limits, and write access to resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>That should do it! ;-) As you can see the APIs themselves are just the starting point. It is too late for edX to be API-first, which would have been much easier, but you have just get your basic APIs, the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">supporting business and political building blocks</a>, and get down to the hard work of evangelizing, managing, and iterating on the edX API. The learning doesn't start until you have the API up, being consumed, and have engage users who are providing feedback for the roadmap.
<p>Once a basic edX API is up and running, and edX has some experience under their belt in managing the API community, then some thought can be put into creating a read / write API, allowing access to student information via oAuth, as well as letting trusted partners publish content, and student data into the system.  A read / write system could be done in a single release, but since edX is a little behind curve on getting API up, I recommend cutting teeth on a read only system for version 1.0.
<p>In reality, this advice for designing, deploying, managing, and evangelizing an API applies to any company with an online presence. It is a pretty proven formula extracted from watching multiple API leaders like Twitter, Google and Amazon. In this particular scenario, edX needs to get on the ball--it is difficult for me to imagine being an online education platform that operates between multiple universities in 2014, and not having an active API. ;-)

        <span class="post-date">06 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/fda/open-fda-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>My friends over at Social Health Insights, <a href="http://socialhealthinsights.com/2014/06/openfda-api-launch-success/">wrote about their experience being one of the beta users for the new OpenFDA API</a>, and what they thought contributed to the success of the API launch from the Food and Drug Administration.
<p>What I found interesting about their post, is that contributing factors were not technical:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Getting Feedback Early -</strong> The openFDA team solicited feedback early on in the API development process from end users and consumers of the API. This feedback was listened to and ultimately helped shape a very nice API at launch.</li>
<li><strong>Being Collaborative - </strong>If you are going to do #1 then you must be willing to be collaborative. From the get-go, the openFDA team collaborated with a number of stakeholders and was open all the feedback that streamed in. This ultimately resulted in a great product at release. Beyond the initial collaboration they are still listening and we bet they will be open to the feedback that comes in.</li>
<li><strong>Being Responsive -</strong> Send a tweet or message to the team and see what you get. You will be shocked at how fast they get back with you to answer your question. We saw questions over Twitter being answered by the community and openFDA team members within minutes (pretty cool)!</li>
<li><strong>Explaining Use Cases Well -</strong> Go to the openFDA website and you will see several queries tied to real wold questions about the data exposed by the new adverse event API. This helps consumers understand the possibilities and content of the API quicker and simpler. Beyond this, they solicited private beta testers to build solutions on top of the API which also provided additional sample use cases of solutions that could be created using the API.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am present on the backchannel for the OpenFDA rollout, so I saw some of the back and forth on the technical aspects of OpenFDA, and there was definitely lots of tech talk, but ultimately the success depended on providing use cases, getting early feedback, while also being collaborative and responsive.
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said a thousand times before, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how technically perfect your API is, without the business and politics of your API dialed in, you will fumble the ball. Always keep in mind, that the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">reasons why this whole API thing is working</a>, goes well beyond just the technology.

<p>After <a href="https://twitter.com/gluecon">#Gluecon</a> in Colorado the other week, I have API design on the brain. A portion of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/23/keeping-the-api-conversation-moving-forward-at-the-gluecon-apistrat-unworkshops/">#APIStrat un-workshops were dedicated to API design related discussion</a>, and <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API Design</a> is also the most trafficked portion of API Evangelist this year, according to my Google Analytics.
<p>At #Gluecon, 3Scale and API Evangelist announced our new <a href="http://apisjson.org">API discovery project APIs.json</a>, and associated tooling, <a href="http://apis.io">API search engine APIs.io</a>. For APIs.json, APIs.io, and API Commons to work, we are counting API providers, and API consumers creating machine readable API definitions.
<p>With this in mind, I wanted to do some exploration--what would be possible incentives for creating machine readable API definitions?

<p>The importance of having an API definition of available resources, is increasing. It was hard to realize the value of defining APIs with the heavy, top down defined WSDL, and even its web counterpart WADL, but with these new approaches, other incentives are emerging&mdash;incentives that live throughout the API lifecycle.
<p>The first tangible shift in this area was when Swagger released the Swagger UI, providing interactive documentation that was generated from a Swagger API definition. Apiary quickly moved the incentives to an earlier stage in the API design lifecycle with design, mocking and collaboration opportunities.
<p>As the API design world continues to explode, I&rsquo;m seeing a number of other incentives emerge for API providers to generate machine readable API definitions, and looking to find any incentives that I&rsquo;m missing, as well as identify any opportunities in how I can encourage API designers to generate machine readable API definitions in whatever format they desire.

        <span class="post-date">05 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://editor.swagger.wordnik.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-editor.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>In January I started taking a closer look at the world of API design, by reviewing the top movers in the space, <a href="https://bit.ly/1kFrKF0">Swagger</a> from <a href="https://bit.ly/1kFrINy">Wordnik</a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/1cl8tCc">API Blueprint</a> from <a href="https://bit.ly/1pb4H8k">Apiary</a>, and <a href="https://bit.ly/16ZTZYt">RAML</a> from <a href="https://bit.ly/1mtmiF9">Mulesoft</a>. My goal was to quantity the world of API design, and help me understand where it might be going, or where there are opportunities for new tools and services.
<p>My intention is to write a white paper on API Design, but haven&rsquo;t reached this point, with the crazy amount of events and travel I&rsquo;ve had in the last couple months. Looking back, at where I left off in my research, the major difference between providers was that Swagger was JSON, and didn't have all the tooling that was available with API Blueprint and RAML.
<p>Fast forward 60 days, and I find myself at Gluecon, hanging out with Tony Tam of Reverb, creator of Swagger. On the last day of the conference,Tony shows me the new Swagger editor, with a new focus on YAML, as well as JSON Swagger definitions.  With one release Tony addresses any gap in the space, leveling the API design playing field between API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML.
<p>While there are many differences between each providers, which you can see in my reposting of  <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/api-definitions-how-do-they-model-rest/">Ole Lensmar of SmartBear explored in his talk at #APIStrat Amsterdam with how they model REST</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/03/api-definitions-what-is-behind-the-name">what is behind the name</a>, each of these top API design solutions will get you there, it just depends on your preferences.
<p>60 days ago I would say that RAML and API Blueprint had a leg up on Swagger because of markdown / YAML focus, and with the amount of tooling they had. With one release Swagger has closed the gap, and with the traction they have amongst developers with a first mover advantage, this could put them squarely in the lead for adoption.
<p>I&rsquo;m predicting I&rsquo;ll have more time this month to finish up my API design research, and produce the first draft of the white paper. API design is proving to one of the most talked about areas of the API sector in 2014, and one I&rsquo;m enjoying tracking on.

<p>I&rsquo;m still playing catch up on many of my stories from over the last month, and one of them is the ability to publish your API definition straight from your API deployment using <a href="https://apispark.com/">APISpark</a>. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with APISpark, it is a cloud-based API deployment service built on the <a href="http://restlet.com/">open source RESTlet framework</a>.
<p>Using APISpark you can deploy APIs from existing Google Spreadsheets, machine readable files on Amazon S3, or directly from a fresh datastore. APISpark gives you all the control you need over generating your endpoints, securing and monitoring the resulting APIs&mdash;all without any programming or back-end infrastructure.
<p>For me, the best part is that once you have your API deployed with APISpark, it automatically generates an <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> manifest, and serves up the URL you need to publish into the commons.
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/api-spark/apispark-api-commons.png" alt="" width="550" />
<p>It means a lot that APISpark understands the importance of publishing your APis to the commons, allow users to publicly showcase their API designs, acknowledging that API definitions should be interoperable, and licensed for re-use. Thanks for baking this feature directly into your API platform, and ensuring all your users play healthy role in the API economy.

<p>There are numerous reasons for API designers to follow hypermedia patterns when crafting their internal, partner or publicly available APIs. One of the most fundamental reasons for offering hypermedia is to help developers understand what to do next, once receiving a response from your API.
<p>Hypermedia APIs mimic the default characteristics of the web, and how you always know what do next with a web page, because there are many available links either in the form of navigation, in the body or footer. Reflecting this behavior, each hypermedia API resources comes with a set of related links giving developers clear actions to take once the response is received.
<p>It can be easy to get lost in the numerous hypermedia debates online, not quite understanding all of the benefits of this fast growing API design pattern, but one clear reason is to help developers understand what to do next. Without clear instructions, developers can make obvious mistakes, misuse or misrepresent API resources, and be out of alignment with your own business goals in providing the API resource in the first place.

        <span class="post-date">05 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://heroku.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/heroku/heroku-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
<p>I am playing around with deploying APIs using multiple cloud platforms, and using popular container solutions. Next up is quickly deploying one of my utility APIs, to <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a>, complete with access control, traffic reports, and supporting analytics with <a href="https://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale infrastructure</a>.
<p><strong>Application - Simple Screen Capture API</strong><br /> I&rsquo;ve been working through an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/an-operational-harness-for-my-screen-capture-api/">operational harness</a> for deploying all my APIs, and the API I use to push forward my approach to API deployment, is a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/creating-my-own-screenshot-api/">screen capture API</a>. This is what I will be deploying on Heroku, creating a simple application, that will take screen captures of web pages that I pass to it.
<p><strong>3Scale Heroku Add-On</strong><br /> To make API deployment on Heroku easier, <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/threescale">3Scale has created a Heroku add-on</a> that you can easily deploy for any application you have running on the PaaS platform. With just a single click I added the 3Scale Heroku add-on to my screen capture API--now I can apply 3Scale API infrastructure to my API.
<p><strong>API Access Control</strong><br /> Using 3Scale I can control who has access to my screen capture API, by setting rate limits and quotas, and if I want I can even charge for access. I can compose any type of service levels for my API that I want. I will create tiers for internal access, external partners, and a public tier where I charge a fee for each API call.
<p><strong>API Traffic Report and Analytics</strong><br /> With all of my screen capture API traffic managed with 3Scale, I can now see traffic analytics and reports, broken down any account, application or for specific service. Any developer who signs up for my screen capture API, will get access to the reports for their account usage as well.
<p><a href="https://addons.heroku.com/threescale"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-service-providers/3Scale/3scale-heroku-add-on.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p><strong>Ready-To-Go Developer Portal</strong><br /> One of the benefits of using 3Scale for deploying your API on Heroku, is that you get a developer portal to go with your APIs. This is where developers will to learn about your API, register for API keys, and view reports on their usage.
<p><strong>Free To Get Started</strong><br /> One of the main reasons I use 3Scale to mange my APIs, is that even though I&rsquo;m on the paid tier now, 3Scale allows me to fire up new APIs, manage access and receive reports at no charge.  I don&rsquo;t pay until my APIs start generating traffic, and if my business model is sound, I should be covered. You get up to 250 user accounts with a traffic volume 150,000 API calls per day before you have to move up to the next tier.
<p><strong>Multi-lingual APIs In Cloud</strong><br /> 3Scale provides <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/threescale#deployment-overview">instructions for deploying APIs using Ruby, Node.js, and Java</a>, allowing you to the language you prefer for API deployment.
<p><strong>Drive API Code From Github</strong><br /> I will be driving the development of the code for my screen capture API using Github. Heroku allows me connect my application to a specific Github repository, allowing me to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/05/github-as-the-central-presence-definition-configuration-and-source-code-for-your-api/">manage all my API deployment centrally using Github</a>.
<p>I already have a PHP version of my screen capture API, that uses the Slim REST framework, which wraps around PhantomJS, which does the actual screen capture. Now I can take my standard utility grade, screen capture API and easily deploy on Heroku, for my own internal use, for a partner, or to any wholesale customer who would like to deploy a screen capture API in their own Heroku account.
<p>Next I&rsquo;m going to look at various ways to deploy the same screen capture API using Amazon Web Services (AWS). There are several options for deploying APIs on AWS, and hopefully I can find the easiest, lowest cost way to get an API deployed, by playing with several approaches.

<p>I started beta testing a new JavaScript library, combined with API, that I&rsquo;m calling linkrot.js. My goal is to address link rot across my blogs. There are two main reasons links are bad on my site, either I moved the page or resource, or a website or other resource has gone away.
<p>To help address this problem, I wrote a simple JavaScript file that lives in the footer of my blog, and when the page loads, it spiders all the links on the page, combining them into a single list and then makes a call to the linkrot.js API.
<p>All new links will get a URL shortener applied, as well as a screenshot taken of the page. Every night a script will run to check the HTTP status of each link used in my site&mdash;verifying the page exists, and is a valid link.
<p>Every time link rot.js loads, it will spider the links available in the page, sync with linkrot.js API, and the API returns the corresponding shortened URL, or if a link shows a 404 status, the link will no longer link to page, it will popup the last screenshot of the page, identifying the page no longer exists.
<p>Eventually I will be developing a dashboard, allowing me to manage the link rot across my websites, make suggestions on links I can fix, provides a visual screen capture of those I cannot, while also adding a new analytics layer by implementing shortened URLs.
<p>Linkrot.js is just an internal tool I&rsquo;m developing in private beta. Once I get up and running, Audrey will beta test, and we&rsquo;ll see where it goes from there. Who knows!

<p>Even with the risk of possible creating some sort of API wormhole, I just added the <a href="http://apicommons.org/apis.html">API Commons API to the API Commons</a>. The API for adding and searching for APIs that are in the commons, now has an <a href="http://apicommons.org/api-commons-manifest.json">API definition</a> that is publicly declared as part of the commons, with a CC-BY license.
<p>It just makes sense to have the API for the commons in the commons, so anyone can establish their own commons, complete with common API. 3Scale and API Evangelist are taking a particular stance on the API copyright discussion, and if our approach doesn&rsquo;t match your vision of the API economy, we encourage you to fork and establish your own commons.
<p>We only launched the API Commons API two months ago, so the definition is still fairly new, and we would love to hear your thoughts on the API definition, and the underlying format of the API Commons Manifest. It is up to all of us to help keep the surface area of the API economy as open, accessible, reusable and interoperable as possible.

        <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/romainhuet/twitter-apis-connecting-to-the-pulse-of-the-planet"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/twitter/romain-huet-twitter-slide-twitter-pulse-of-planet.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of watching Romain Huet (<a href="https://twitter.com/romainhuet">@romainhuet</a>), developer evangelist at Twitter, give his very entertaining talk three times now, and if you haven&rsquo;t seen it, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkKEZMjFLSQ">looking it up on the APIStrat Youtube channel</a>. Romain walks us through the world of Twitter, showing us the power of the platform and its API, but the really entertaining part is the two Internet of things (Iot) demos that he executes during his talk.
<p>The first demo Romain does, is taking an audience selfie using a Raspberry Pi driven camera, triggered by a Tweet. The second demo involves flying a quadcopter drone on stage, that uses <a href="http://nodecopter.com/">NodeCopter</a>&nbsp;as the&nbsp;interface, and Twitter as the communication layer. Both demos are crowd pleasers, which makes for not just an entertaining talk, but shows the potential of Iot + APIs, while also making the audience part of the experience.
<p>I think the demos that Romain delivers are important, because they offer a unique learnng gateway to both Iot and APIs. While Twitter as a communication layer for the Internet of things may not be a scalable, production ready solution for talking to devices, I think it is a great learning platform for individuals to learn not just about APIs, but how APIs can be used to communicate with the devices in their world.
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkKEZMjFLSQ"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/romain-apistrat-ams.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p><strong>Simple Communication</strong><br /> Twitter is a simple communication platform, which posseses a social graph that is easy to understand by people who are new to the world of APIs. When individuals are  experimenting with both APIs and Iot, Twitter provides a great 101 level sandbox to learn from fun, simple, meaningful IoT + API tutorials.
<p><strong>Simple API</strong><br /> The Twitter API is very mature, providing a simple, yet robust communication API to jumpstart their education. The overhead to get up and running on Twitter API by new users is very low, and with simple tutorials based upon demos like Romain&rsquo;s selfie photo, and drone, the platform provides a great sandbox for experiencing these IoT + API interactions.
<p><strong>Public And Social By Default</strong><br /> Twitter is a public communication channel. Sure you can use DM&rsquo;s between users, but Twitter is open and social by default, and excellent introduction to the importance of security and privacy in the world of Iot. Users will immediately be faced with questions of messages being public, who will see, and how your devices will have to communicate in this open environment.
<p><strong>Twitter As Stepping Stone</strong><br /> When it comes to Iot communication, Twitter is not a scalable solution, however it is an excellent stepping stone. Not all users who engage with Iot + API tutorials will need to scale their implementation. This approach to learning about IoT and APIs is just be a stepping stone, giving new users an API 101 introductory course on how devices like Raspberry Pi, Nodecopter and other IoT devices operate&mdash;where they go next is up to them.

        <p><a href="https://tosdr.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/terms-of-service-didnt-read/tos-didnt-read-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been following the work of <a href="https://tosdr.org/">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read</a> for some time now. In my opinion this work is some of the most important legal work out there right now, which is guiding all of our activity not just online, but increasingly in our offline worlds. If you aren't familiar with Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read, I think their slogan sums it up well:
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;I have read and agree to the Terms&rdquo; is the biggest lie on the web. We aim to fix that.</em></blockquote>
<p>More clarity and balance in the terms of service that online services employ is critical to the future of society and the web, this single checkbox is deciding our fate, whether you realize it or not. One of the projects I&rsquo;m working on in coming months, is forking and extending the Terms of Service Didn't Read work into the world of APIs.
<p>While I was aware that the Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read work is openly licensed, I wasn't aware of the degree of openness, until I started digging through their <a href="https://github.com/tosdr/">Github account</a> and found <a href="https://github.com/tosdr/tosdr.org/tree/master/topics">machine readable inventory of the questions they ask of TOS</a>. This is huge!
<p>To achieve their rating of each online service, TOS Didn't Read asks questions of each service providers TOS. This list of questions is critical to making sense of the complex legalese that TOS contain, allowing for them to derive a rating for each service, and provide a list of plain english description of what you face when signing up for each online service.
<p>In coming months, I will be working on a forked version of TOS Didn't Read, applying their machine readable questions specifically to APIs, and hopefully contributing cycles to the central TOS Didn&rsquo;t Read. My intention is to make machine readable API definitions for this critical building block of the API economy.

        <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-surveillance-camera.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;m an advisor to the camera API platform, <a href="https://www.evercam.io/">EverCam</a>. I don&rsquo;t advise the startup because I&rsquo;m super excited about the opportunities for APIs for security cameras. I'm involved because I believe in the Evercam team, and I want to be aware of this fast growing aspect of the Internet of things and API economy. Security cameras are not going away, and I want to help lend some critical thought to how we use security cameras, and apply APIs to help introduce transparency and accountability into this easily abused layer of our society.
<p>One of the things I learned from Evercam, is that <a href="https://www.gov.uk/request-cctv-footage-of-yourself">in the UK you can request any photos of you taken on the vast closed circuit television</a>, that is ubiquitous across the UK landscape. You can submit a request for a time, day and location and request any photo or video footage taken of you. Its kind of like a visual FOIA request for the surveillance layer of our society. This concept intrigued me, and I wanted to explore in relationship to other layers of convergence between the API economy and our increasingly digital society.
<p>Imagine if there was FOIA process for data. I could submit a request to a single organization that would then make requests to leading technology, and big data companies, asking them for a copy of all data they possess about me, and disclose any partners that they have shared this data with. I know portions of this exist from companies like <a href="https://www.acxiom.com/">Acxiom</a>, but I would like to see a more coherent, intra-company solution that could better serve individuals who wish to understand how companies are using their data.
<p>A concept like FOIA for data across any company will not please corporate america, especially in a landscape where exploitation of users data is the predominant business model. However we are in the early years of the Internet, and things are very much the wild wild west, and it is only a matter of time before government regulations are needed to ensure the privacy of all citizens, and reduce exploitation and abuse by the bad apples.
<p>This concept isn't far fetched. With modern, API driven systems, it is easy to track all of a users data, and where and how it is used across a company&rsquo;s network. If all data access is required to occur via APIs, it will be easy to pull a history of which users were accessed, by which internal or external consumers. Each company could be required to have an API allowing a 3rd party auditor to pull data on behalf of users, allowing independent organizations to make FOIA style data requests across multiple companies on behalf of users.
<p>I know that business owners will cry foul at such an idea, claiming it is just more unnecessary regulation that they will have to deal with, but we need a way of making all this more accountable. The API driven systems that would make this possible would also give companies all the other benefits APIs afford, in making company assets more accessible. APIs would allow companies to rapidly deploy web and mobile applications, while also providing assurances to every citizen that their privacy was being respected, and all of our vital personal information was not being exploited.

        <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/census/us-census-api-ideas.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" />
<p>I've been tracking on the <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-135.html">API from the US Census Bureau since they launched in 2012</a>, and even <a href="https://plus.google.com/+KinLane/posts/4suNfHBWfUE">met with them to discuss their strategy</a> over the last couple years. The team at the Census Bureau has slowly integrated an external API into their operations, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/19/providing-full-data-download-vs-api/">opening up conversations around census survey data</a>, that is harder to achieve from just downloads only.
<p>I recently saw a <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/blog/2014/06/03/research-2020-census-continues-%E2%80%93-census-bureau-opens-temporary-office">post that Census Bureau is gearing up for the 2020 census</a>. As I was reading the post, I couldn't help but think about how the Census API will influence how the 2020 census is executed. Additionally I wonder if any other APIs will be used during the census process, such as Twitter or other social platforms.
<p>In my opinion, the census, and its resulting data will continue to be a cornerstone of the API and open data space. Census data adds a lot of value to other websites, mobile apps, and data visualizations and analysis, and is critical in providing context for both our online and offline worlds. I will continue to keep an eye on the <a href="https://www.census.gov/developers/">US Census API</a>, and look for signs of how APIs are influencing the 2020 census.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">Another Strong API Implementation In Federal Government With OpenFDA</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/fda/open-fda-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>I am really impressed with the quality of API deployments coming out of the federal government recently. I wrote about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/08/18f-shows-what-is-possible-in-government-with-fbopen-api/">FBOpen API from 18F</a> a couple months ago, and the latest is the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html">OpenFDA API from the Food &amp; Drug Administration</a>. I&rsquo;ve been watching the rollout of the API from behind the scenes for a while now, but with all my travel and speaking I haven't had time to write about or participate, but now that they've officially launch publicly, I wanted to help showcase what they've been up to at the FDA.
<p><strong>Meaningful First Impression</strong><br /> When you first land on OpenFDA, you immediately understand what it does, thanks to the interactive visual on the homepage introducing OpenFDA, letting you know that it contains more than 3 million adverse drug event reports, with frequently reported indications for drug use among women, 55 to 90. This simple simple description, combined with an interactive visual that demonstrates the value contained within this government API resource, leaves a meaningful first impression upon arrival.
<p><strong>Not Just Talk Of Being Open</strong><br /> We&rsquo;ve misused the word open when it comes to APIs, so that I&rsquo;m always skeptical when I see it use, but not in the case of OpenFDA. At the top of the home page, it gives three distinct examples of how OpenFDA embraces open, with data, code, and in community, and through making the API openly accessible, simply by requesting a key, in exchange for your email address.
<p><strong>Explaining What It Is All About</strong><br /> OpenFDA explains what the OpenFDA is all about with a detailed about page, telling what the API does, who worked on the project, and how you can get involved. This type of background is often overlooked by API providers, requiring API consumers to have to piece together what the big picture is around an API&mdash;not with OpenFDA. On-boarding with the API starts with an overview of the project, and resulting API, then dropping you into what is needed to get signed up and begin using the API.
<p><strong>Key Based Authentication</strong><br /> All that is required to get up and running using the OpenFDA API, is a valid email address, which in return you get an API key that you can use to make all API calls. Of course there are terms of service (TOS) and rate limit restrictions on each key, but this is standard operating procedure for APIs, especially one still in beta.
<p><a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/elasticsearch/elastic-search-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p><strong>Deployed Using ElasticSearch</strong><br /> Where the FBOpen from 18F used <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr to deploy their API</a>, OpenFDA uses <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">search and analytics platform ElasticSearch</a> to deploy their API. I think both of these approaches reflect an interesting trend in government, which deploys APIs from existing, an sometimes messy data stores, allowing a more meaningful and useful layer to be added with very little effort.
<p><strong>Powerful Search Capabilities</strong><br /> One of the benefit of using existing search solutions like ElasticSearch, is that you get some pretty sophisticated search tools, with very little work. OpenFDA starts with providing the basic query parameters for search, then also adds in query syntax, exact matches, grouping, dates, and ranges&mdash;providing very powerful search capabilities out of the box.
<p><strong>Necessary Terminology To Get Started</strong><br /> When using the OpenFDA API, you are accessing drug events, which will require some necessary terminology to get up to speed on the world of pharmaceuticals, unless of course this is the world you already live in. OpenFDA provides the necessary, to get anyone up to speed on the terminology needed to understand what is contained the 3 million drug event reports.
<p><strong>Interactive API Documentation With Visuals</strong><br /> Interactive API documentation, allowing API consumers to make live API calls while learning about an API, is fast becoming essential for any API. OpenFDA provides interactive documentation, making learning about the OpenFDA API a hands-on experience, but takes this ones step further by providing supporting data visualizations. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of interactive API documentation, and I don&rsquo;t believe I've ever seen real-time visualizations to go with documentation&mdash;something I will explore further in a separate story.
<p><strong>Essential  Communication Channels</strong><br /> OpenFDA doesn't miss a beat in establishing the required communication channels for the API, providing updates on the platform in a blog format, available directly from the home page. Additionally OpenFDA employs Twitter, providing a real-time conversation around the valuable API resource, between the FDA and 3rd party consumers. Open, active communication channels, providing two-way communication between a platform and its consumers, is one of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">essential ingredients that make this whole API thing work</a>.
<p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/fda/introducing-open-fda.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
<p><strong>Essential Support Framework</strong><br /> Building on top of OpenFDA platform updates, and Twitter communication channels, OpenFDA provides a multi-tiered support framework, allowing API consumers to ask questions on StackExchange, report bugs via Github, and send feedback via email. The OpenFDA support framework plus the open communication channels, establishes a robust feedback loop for the FDA around drug event report data.
<p><strong>Active Github Presence</strong><br /> Github is an essential building block for all government APIs in my opinion, and OpenFDA agrees. You can find code samples for OpenFDA in a Github repository, submit bug reports via the Github issue management, and even the developer portal for the OpenFDA API runs using Github Pages, and underlying repository--nice start for your <a href="https://github.com/fda">Github account OpenFDA</a>.
<p><strong>Realizing This Is More Than Just Tech</strong><br /> Showcasing the idea that APIs are way more than just the underlying tech is what API Evangelist is all about, and in my opinion OpenFDA gets this 100% with their API implementation. The OpenFDA technical implementation is built using existing technology, on top of valuable open government data, providing the necessary technical building blocks to be considered a modern web API. However, OpenFDA is so much more, delivering the best first impression possible, fritctionless on-boarding, and the required education you will need to put OpenFDA to work. OpenFDA also provides the necessary feedback loop to ensure an APIs success, with updates, Twitter, StackExchange, Github, and good ol email, there will be the necessary discussion around OpenFDA that is required move things forward.
<p>The OpenFDA API is in beta, but already posses many of the essential building blocks for a successful API. I&rsquo;m sure with some hacking I could find room for improvement in the API, and supporting operations. Something I will do as I have time, adding to the existing feedback I've been seeing from other beta users.  For now, I&rsquo;m impressed with the release, and when you bundle alongside other API initiatives like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/08/18f-shows-what-is-possible-in-government-with-fbopen-api/">FBOpen</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/03/significance-of-the-we-the-people-api-being-first-modern-read--write-web-api-in-government/">We The People</a>, it makes me very optimistic about what APIs are going to be able to accomplish in federal government.

        <span class="post-date">03 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/we-the-people/we_the_people.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<p>I finished up <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/02/my-response-to-how-can-the-department-of-education-increase-innovation-transparency-and-access-to-data/">my response to the Department of Education RFI focused around the use of APIs</a> at the government agency, a place where I&rsquo;m not just advocating for APIs, but pushing very hard for read / write APIs. I finished up my response to the RFI while waiting for my flight out of Barcelona where I spoke at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">API Days Mediterranea</a>, where I the heard echoes of the importance role that write APIs will play in government, during a talk from Xavier Badosa (<a href="https://twitter.com/badosa">@badosa</a>).
<p>All of this primed the pump for me thinking about write APIs in government, while on my flight back to Los Angeles. This will be one of the biggest challenges API evangelists in government will face in coming years, something that scares the shit out of government leaders and their legal advisors, but will also be essential to government assuming its role in the API economy.
<p>A read and write strategy for some government APIs, will evolve government resources from being just a download, to being a conversation with private sector interests that are putting those resources to use. As I highlighted in my Department of Education RFI response, allowing reading and writing to government resources, combined with development of sensible service composition around these resources, and establishment of trusted access tiers, will be the connector between the public and private sector, in the API economy.
<p>I&rsquo;m not API delusional enough to believe that deploying of APIs, or even read / write APIs will automatically be a good thing in all scenarios. However the opportunity to increase access to government resources by the private sector, in a secure and controlled way, should be considered by all government agencies. When appropriate, the design and deployment of read / write APIs is bundled with all the essential <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/tools.html">building blocks for API management</a>, it has the potential to allow for a new, real-time, two way partnership to emerge between the public and private sector.
<p>With this vision in mind, I can&rsquo;t help but think about the significance of the first, modern read / write web API in the United States federal government, being the We The People API. While there are other write API resources in government like the<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint"> IRS modernized e-file system</a>, the <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers">We The People API</a> is the first read / write API with al the hallmark characteristics of a modern web API.
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy into all the bullshit rhetoric Silicon Valley and the API industry (sometimes me) spouts about APIs democratizing everything, I think they can just as easily be used in dictatorships, and efforts to lock up resources&mdash;APIs just reflect their owners objectives. Even with this, I couldn&rsquo;t think of a better read / write API initiative than the We The People platform, which provides a way for citizens to petition the White House, potentially &ldquo;giving all Americans a way to engage their government on the issues that matter to them.&rdquo;
<p>While APIs does not automaticaly equal democracy, I think APIs will play a central role in the future of government. I will be closely watching, and hopefully even participating in the<a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/write-api-beta-testing"> We The People Write API beta initiative</a>. I&rsquo;m not sure what the outcome will be, but I think the effort is worth supporting, and if we can pull off, will be a shining example of read / write APIs in government, providing a precedent that other agencies can follow in their own efforts, hopefully opening up the floodgates for read / write APIs in government.

        <span class="post-date">03 Jun 2014</span>

<p>I&rsquo;m working my way through the collection of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat">talks from API Strategy &amp; Practice Amsterdam that are available on Youtube</a>, and I'm reminded of what an amazing lineup of speakers we've managed to assemble at not just #APIStrat Amsterdam, but also in San Francisco and New York.
<p>Today I re-watched three videos which I think reflect not just #APIStrat, but also where we are at in the industry:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOjESChb0sU">Mike Amundsen</a> </strong>- In an effort to understand where we are going with the API economy , Mike looks back at the history of computing, trying to understand how we got here, uncovering some interesting patterns, while weaving it all together into a compelling story worthy of a Ken Burns PBS documentary.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkKEZMjFLSQ">Romain Huet</a></strong> - When selecting talks for #APIStrat we don't just select big brands, we look for the most compelling speakers, and the #APIStrat audience got both with a walk through the Twittersphere and bonus look at the convergence of Internet of Things and APIs, by taking an audience selfie, and flying a drone on stage, from Romain Huett of Twitter.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXk1dvLKl-U">Eva Sjokvist</a></strong> - Eva from Absolut Vodka wowed the #APIStrat audience with the story of their cocktail database API, which went beyond tech, and internally changed culture at the leading vodka manufacturer, teaching them how to look outside the company walls and realize the benefits of external partnerships.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working my way through other talks, but these three stand out as examples of what we look for from presenters at #APIStrat. Our speakers tell stories, wow the audience with entertaining demonstrations of the power of APIs, while showcasing how APIs have made an impact at companies, and within industries around the globe.
<p>If you have an idea for a talk that you would like to share at #APIStrat in Chicago, something that you think will not just benefit the 700+ attendees, but will also push the API space forward, we want to hear from you. The only thing is you have 48 hours left to submit, before the call for papers closes. Don't miss out on being part of the conversation at #APIStrat, as well as making your mark on moving things forward&mdash;<a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/contact-call-for-papers.php">submit your talk before Thursday 5PM PDT to get in on the action</a>.

        <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/images/logos/ed.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>I spent considerable time going through the <a href="https://www.ed.gov/blog/2014/04/how-can-the-department-of-education-increase-innovation-transparency-and-access-to-data/">Department of Education RFI</a>, answering each question in as much detail as I possibly could. You can find my full response below. In the end I felt I could provide more value by summarizing my response, eliminating much of the redundancy across different sections of the RFI, and just cut through the bureaucracy as I (and APIs) prefer to do.
<p><strong>Open Data By Default</strong><br /> All publicly available data at the Department of Education needs to be open by default. This is not just a mandate, this is a way of life. There is no data that is available on any Department of Education websites that should not be available for data download. Open data downloads are not separate from existing website efforts at Department of Education, they are the other side of the coin, making the same content and data available in machine readable formats, rather than available via HTML&mdash;allowing valuable resources to be used in systems and applications outside of the department&rsquo;s control.
<p><strong>Open API When There Are Resources</strong><br /> The answer to whether or not the Department of Education should provide APIs is the same as whether or not the agency should deploy websites&mdash;YES! Not all individuals and companies will have the resources to download, process, and put downloadable resources to use. In these situations APIs can provide much easier access to open data resources, and when open data resources are exposed as APIs it opens up access to a much wider audience, even non-developers. Lightweight, simple, API access to open data inventory should be default along with data downloads when resources are available. This approach to APIs by default, will act as the training ground for not just 3rd party developers, but also internally, allowing Department of Education staff to learn how to manage APIs in a safe, read-only environment.
<p><strong>Using A Modern API Design, Deployment, and Management Approach</strong><br /> As the usage of the Internet matured in 2000, many leading technology providers like SalesForce and Amazon began using web APIs to make digital assets available to 3rd party partners, and 14 years later there are some very proven approaches to designing, deploying and management APIs. API management is not a new and bleeding edge approach to making assets available in the private sector, there are numerous API tools and services available, and this has begun to extend to the government sector with tools like API Umbrella from NREL, being employed by api.data.gov and other agencies, as well as other tools and services being delivered by 18F from GSA. There are many proven blueprints for the Department of Education to follow when embarking on a complete API strategy across the agency, allowing innovation to occur around specific open data, and other program initiatives, in a safe, proven way.
<p><strong>Use API Service Composition For Maximum Access &amp; Control</strong><br /> One benefit of 14 years of evolution around API design, deployment, and management is the establishment of sophisticated service composition of API resources. Service composition refers to the granular, modular design and deployment of APIs, while being able to manage who has access to these resources. Modern API access is not just direct, public access to a database. API service composition allows for designing exactly the access to resources that is necessary, one that is in alignment with business objectives, while protecting the privacy and security of everyone involved. Additionally service composition allows for real-time awareness of how all data, content, and other resources at the Department of Education are accessed and put to use, allowing new APIs to be designed to support specific needs, and existing APIs to evolved based upon actual demand, not just speculation.
<p><strong>Deeper Understanding Of How Resources Are Used</strong><br /> A modern API service composition layer opens up possibility for a new analytics layer that is not just about measuring and reporting of access to APIs, it is about understanding precisely how resources are accessed in real-time, allowing API design, deployment and management processes to be adjusted in a more rapid and iterative way, that contributes to the roadmap, while providing the maximum enforcement of security and privacy of everyone involved.  When the Department of Education internalizes a healthy, agency-wide API approach, a new real-time understanding will replace this very RFI centered process that we are participating in, allowing for a new agility, with more control and flexibility than current approaches. A RFI cycle takes months, and will contain a great deal of speculation about what would be, where API access, coupled with healthy analytics and feedback loops, answers all the questions being addressed in this RFI, in real-time, reducing resource costs, and wasted cycles.
<p><strong>APIs Open Up Synchronous and Asynchronous Communication Channels</strong><br /> Open data downloads represents a broadcast approach to making Department of Education content, data and other resources available, representing a one way street. APIs provide a two-way communication, bringing external partners and vendors closer to Department of Education, while opening up feedback loops with the Department of Education, reducing the distance between the agency and its private sector partners&mdash;potentially bringing valuable services closer to students, parents and the companies or institutions that serve them.  Feedback loops are much wider currently at the Department of Education occur on annual, monthly and at the speed of email or phone calls , with the closest being in person at events, something that can be a very expensive endeavor. Web APIs provide a real-time, synchronous and asynchronous communication layer that will improve the quality of service between Department of Education and the public, for a much lower cost than traditional approaches.
<p><strong>Building External Ecosystem of Partners</strong><br />The availability of high value API resources, coupled with a modern approach to API design, deployment and management, an ecosystem of trusted partners can be established, allowing the Department of Education to share the workload with an external partner ecosystem. API service composition allows the agency to open up access to resources to only the partners who have proven they will respect the privacy and security of resources, and be dedicated to augmenting and helping extend the mission of the Department of Education. As referenced in the RFI, think about the ecosystem established by the IRS modernized e-file system, and how the H&amp;R Blocks, and Jackson Hewitt&rsquo;s of the world help the IRS share the burden of the country's tax system. Where is the trusted ecosystem for the Department of Education? The IRS ecosystem has been in development for over 25 years, something the Department of Education has to get to work on theirs now.
<p><strong>Security Fits In With Existing Website Security Practices</strong><br /> One of the greatest benefits of web APIs is that they utilize existing web technologies that are employed to deploy and manage websites. You don&rsquo;t need additional security approaches to manage APIs beyond existing websites. Modern web APIs are built on HTTP, just like websites, and security can be addressed right alongside current website security practices&mdash;instead of delivering HTML, APIs are delivering JSON and XML. APIs even go further, and by using modern API service composition practices, the Department of Education gains an added layer of security and control, which introduces granular levels of access to all resource, something that does not exist for website. With a sensible analytics layer, API security isn&rsquo;t just about locking down, it is about understanding who is access resources, how they are using them, striking a balance between the security and access of resources, which is the hallmark of APIs.
<p><strong>oAuth Gives Identity and Access Control To The Student</strong><br /> Beyond basic web security, and the heightened level of control modern API management deliver, there is a 3rd layer to the security and privacy layer of APis that does not exist anywhere else&mdash;oAuth. Open Authentication or oAuth provides and  identity and access layer on top of API that gives end-users, and owner of personal data control over who access their data. Technology leaders in the private sector are all using oAuth to give platform users control over how their data is used in applications and systems. oAuth is the heartbeat of API security, giving API platforms a way to manage security, and how 3rd party developers access and put resources to use, in a way that gives control to end users. In the case of the Department of Education APIs, this means putting the parent and student at the center of who accesses, and uses their personal data, something that is essential to the future of the Department of Education.
<p><strong>How Will Policy Be Changed?</strong><br />I'm not a policy wonk, nor will I ever be one. One thing I do know is you will never understand the policy implications in one RFI, nor will you change policy to allow for API innovation in one broad stroke--you will fail. Policy will have to be changed incrementally, a process that fits nicely with the iterative, evolutionary life cyce of API managment. The cultural change at Department of Education, as well as evolutionary policy change at the federal level will be the biggest benefits of APIs at the Department of Education.&nbsp;
<p><strong>An Active API Platform At Department of Education Would Deliver What This RFI Is Looking For</strong><br /> I know it is hard for the Department of Education to see APIs as something more than a technical implementation, and you want to know, understand and plan everything ahead of time&mdash;this is baked into the risk averse DNA of government. &nbsp;Even with this understanding, as I go through the RFI, I can&rsquo;t help but be frustrated by the redundancy, bureaucracy, over planning, and waste that is present in this process. An active API platform would answer every one of your questions you pose, with much more precision than any RFI can ever deliver.
<p>If the Department of Education had already begun evolving an API platform for all open data sets currently available on data.gov, the agency would have the experience in API design, deployment and management to address 60% of the concerns posed by this RFI. Additionally the agency would be receiving feedback from existing integrators about what they need, who they are, and what they are building to better serve students and institutions. Because this does not exist there will be much speculation about who will use Department of Education APIs, and how they will use them and better serve students. While much of this feedback will be well meaning, it will not be rooted in actual use cases, applications and existing implementations. An active API ecosystem answers these questions, while keeping answers rooted in actual integrations, centered around specific resources, and actual next steps for real world applications.
<p>The learning that occurs from managing read-only API access, to low-level data, content and resources would provide the education and iteration necessary for the key staff at Department of Education to reach the next level, which would be read / write APIs, complete with oAuth level security, which would be the holy grail in serving students and achieving the mission of the Department of Education. I know I&rsquo;m biased, because of my focus on APIs, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">read / write access to all Department of Education resources over the web and via mobile devices, that gives full control to students, is the future of the agency</span>. There is no "should we do APIs", there is only the how, and I&rsquo;m afraid we are wasting time, and we need to just do it, and learn to ask these questions along the way.
<p>There is proven technology and processes available to make all Department of Education data, content and resources available, allowing both read and write access in a secure way, that is centered around the student. The private sector is 14 years ahead of the government in delivering private sector resources in this way, and other government agencies are ahead of the Department of Education in doing this as well, but there is an opportunity for the agency to still lead and take action, by committing the resources necessary to not just deploy a single API, but internalize APIs in a way that will change the way learning occurs in the coming decades across all US institutions.

        <span class="post-date">29 May 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/swagger/Swagger-Logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p><em>This post is an exact copy from the<a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec"> Swagger specification page</a>, on the Swagger Github project. As I was reviewing the latest Swagger 2.0 release, I read this descripton, and I really felt it caputred not ust the mission of Swagger, but spoke to the essence of API design. With this in mind I wanted to re-post, as part of my ongoing coverage of the API design space.&nbsp;</em>
<p>The goal of Swagger&trade; is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swager removes the guesswork in calling the service.
<p>Use cases for machine-readable API interfaces include interactive documentation, code generation for documentation, client, and server, as well as automated test cases. Swagger-enabled APIs expose JSON files that correctly ahere to the Swagger Specification, documented in this repository. These files can either be produced and served statically, or be generated dynamically from your application.
<p>Without going into a long history of interfaces to Web Services, this is not the first attempt to do so. We can learn from CORBA, WSDL and WADL. These specifications had good intentions but were limited by proprietary vendor-specific implementations, being bound to a specific programming language, and goals which were too open-ended. In the end, they failed to gain traction.
<p>Swagger does not require you to rewrite your existing API. It does not require binding any software to a service--the service being described may not even be yours. It does, however, require the capabilities of the service be described in the structure of the Swagger Specification. Not all services can be described by Swagger--this specification is not intended to cover every possible use-case of a REST-ful API. Swagger does not define a specific development process such as design-first or code-first. It does facilitate either technique by establishing clear interactions with a REST API.
<p>This <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec">GitHub project is the starting point for Swagger</a>. Here you will find the information you need about the Swagger Specification, a simple static sample of what it looks like, and some general information regarding the project.

        <span class="post-date">23 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/linguistics/why-apis-should-be-designed-by-linguists.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly evangelizing how APIs bring individuals and companyies out of their silos and stimulate conversations internally amongst distributed groups,co and externally with partners and the public.
<p>During a federal government panel this Monday in Maryland, I was facilitating a discussion between NASA, GSA, the White House, with participation from Energy, FEMA and other agencies. It was mentioned several times that APIs were facilitating conversation beyond what just a data download does, in a way that changed culture, making APIs more about people than technology&mdash;something that is core to my mission as the API Evangelist.
<p>A well crafted API, with essential building blocks like interactive documentation, blogs, forums, active social media accounts, create valuable feedback loops that stimulate conversation around valuable API resources, and the applications and sites that put them use.
<p>Then later this week, at Gluecon in Colorado, I saw a talk from Rebecca Standig (<a href="https://twitter.com/understandig">@understandig</a>), linguist and software engineer at <a href="https://keen.io/">Keen.io,</a> that blew my mind, taking the concept of APIs and communication to a whole new level. Rebecca connected the dots between linguistics, the need for linguists to have programming skills, and the potential when they design APIs. I&rsquo;m still processing everything she said, and told her I&rsquo;d like to work together more to tell stories about lingistics and APIs, so there will be more stories on this subject, but I had to share my initial thoughts while I was processing my Evernote from the talk.
<p>I&rsquo;m always working to craft meaningful stories in the API space, that will help people understand the potential of APIs. Throughout my evangelism I&rsquo;m encouraging companies, organizations and government agencies to employ APIs that will help stimulate conversation with employees, partners and the public. What Rebecca is proposing takes this to a whole new level for me, and opening up new possibilities for how we configure applications to communicate, in a way that is rooted in, and derived from our own understanding of how humans communicate.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">Restaurant Menus As Analogy For API Copyright</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">23 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-restaurant-menu.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
<p>One of the interesting conversations that came out of the <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Gluecon/">APIStrat Un-Workshops at Gluecon</a> this week, was the exploration of the analogy of applying copyright to restaurant menus, and applying copyright to APIs. This type of conversations is why 3Scale and API Evangelist support these types of events.
<p>When you Google the topic of restaurant menu API copyright, you get a wealth of contradictory answers that show the difficulty of applying copyright to menus. In practice you can put a copyright on your menu, and you could probably spend a lot of energy enforcing this if someone copies your menu. In reality, it will probably be pretty hard to win, unless your menu is exactly copied, and a fair use claim couldn&rsquo;t be enforced.
<p>One interesting layer in this discussion, is the ubiquity of restaurant menus, and even the order, naming and organization of these menus. A phase I don&rsquo;t think APIs have reached, but will at some point. It is pretty difficult to argue that menus are essential to interoperability, meaning you can sit down at any restaurant and the menu contributes to you on boarding with the restaurant experience. Imagine if you had to know to ask for food via a chalkboard, or pick up some phone to call in what you wanted, without knowing any orderly way of understanding what a restaurant provided? Each restaurant would be different, and screw up the whole thing.
<p>I would argue that bookmarks, images, video and other common API designs are just like hamburgers, steaks, and salads, when I explore this analogy. I think a lot of the confusion in the API copyright discussion is around the separation between an API and the API definition. The order and layout of restaurant menu is not the restaurant, just like the API design is not the API.
<p>Could you imagine enforcing copyright on a american restaurant or diner menu layout? Maybe with fast food, which is not about delivering value, but maximizing profit. I think things are just newer in the API space vs the restaurant industry, but the analogy holds up. As a restaurant, your menu is not your restaurant. If someone copies your menu exactly, and opens up across the street, you may have a copyright case where fair use may be hard to defend, but in the end is their steak dinner the same as your steak dinner? Ultimately it comes down to your service, ingredients, presentation, price, ambiance and the other building blocks of a restaurant.
<p>This same thought process can be applied to APIs. If you offer an image API, and someone copies your image API design exactly, the APIs are not exact copies. What you have behind the API design is the value, and represents your company&rsquo;s intellectual property, not the API design. Allowing your API definition to be copied will increase interoperability, and increase the chance developers will build clients, and other tooling that encourages interoperability&mdash;think about Amazon EC2 and S3. Does every copy of the API design deliver the exact same value as Amazon API? I think not.
<p>In the end, if you don&rsquo;t see the separation between an API and its design, the benefits that an open API design delivers to not just an individual API ecosystem, but the overall API sector, you probably don&rsquo;t understand APIs well enough, and /or you are just concerned too much with monetization and control, and you really don&rsquo;t belong in the API space.&nbsp;
<p>I'm guessing that we will end up with the fast food of APIs who really don't offer much value, but actively enforce their brand, which is tightly coupled with their API design. Even with this shit in the market, the rest of us can work hard to offer high quality APIs, which employ open API designs.

        <span class="post-date">23 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-sad-face.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>When I run into enterprise folks at events, one of the common characteristics I notice, is they always tell me how much they read my blog. Yay! Many of these people have Twitter accounts, which follow me and I follow them, and they can usually reference specific topics or posts I've written&mdash;demonstrating they do indeed read.
<p>Most of these people I'm aware of online, and I usually consider them fence sitters. They rarely retweet posts, or engage in conversations online, they just consume. I think this is fine, because not all everyone is suited for actively engaging in the social media world. What I do think is interesting is how interested they are in my work, and they let me know how my work reaches them, and reference specific topics and stories, but don&rsquo;t actually contribute to the conversation.
<p>In my opinion this isn't individuals faults, this is enterprise culture. Businesses of this scale are not equipped to deliver value unless it is sanctioned and specifically part of the larger brand. The enterprise generates value, but only when in service of their business objectives. Generating open value for a community, even as small as a retweet, comment, or a response in blog post, is not in the DNA.
<p>I strongly believe that businesses should generate just as much value as they consume. I&rsquo;m not stupid. I understand that capitalism is about extracting value and monetizing for shareholders, but can&rsquo;t help but think about what this existence is like for these individuals.
<p>Personally, I find it very rewarding to contributing to communities, and the overall health of the API community, by contributing ideas, engaging in conversations, without the expectation that it will all result in revenue for <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>. Ultimately all of this effort comes back to me, and ensures I will be able to sustain my evangelism efforts, while also nourishing my own individual needs.

        <span class="post-date">23 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/steve-apistrat-gluecon.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<p>I&rsquo;m still gathering my thoughts from the deep technical conversations that occurred on Tuesday at the <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Gluecon/">Gluecon APIStrat Un-Workshops</a>&nbsp;in Colorado. Before the official <a href="http://gluecon.com/">Gluecon festivities</a> kicked off, 3Scale and API Evangelist held a 5 hour un-workshop where approximately 70 API professionals gathered to discuss some of the most pressing topics in the API space.
<p><strong>Internet of Things</strong><br /> One of the fastest growing areas of the API design and deployment, is in support of the Internet of things (IoT). During the IoT portion we had some interesting conversation around how APIs enable communication in Iot world, including some heated discussion about whether or not HTTP will scale and handle the fast growing Iot space.
<p><strong>API Versioning</strong><br /> One of the hot topics proposed within the API design un-workshop was API versioning, which I thought would be a technical dive into versioning, but ended up being more of the human side of versioning, and communicating with your API consumers&mdash;clearly setting expectations around the how and why of API versioning.
<p><strong>Real-Time</strong><br /> Dovetailing nicely with the Iot discussion, there was a very enlightening discussion around real-time, which covered one of the most fundamental issues of real-time&mdash;what is it? As with the API versioning discussion, the conversation took gave a nod to the human side of tech, acknowledging real-time was more about expectations of end-users and providers, than about technology.
<p><strong>API Copyright</strong><br /> As expected the topic of API copyright was a major part of the discussion, not just at the APIStart Un-workshops, but also the wider Gluecon. A group of us walked through the legal case, where everything stands with API Commons, and how we can best take the offensive attack on the issue as a community, which includes educating more API providers, consumers and business owners.
<p><strong>API Design &amp; Discovery</strong><br /> Emphasizing the importance of the release of <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> and <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a>, and the conversations around <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, a portion of the API design workshop walked through the available API definition formats, and ultimately how APIs are discovered. The conversation went beyond classic API directories, and the newer approaches to search introduced by APIs.io, and discussed IDE integration for API discovery, as well as in the Internet of Things&mdash;again showing the overlap of all the areas of discussion at APIStrat&nbsp;Un-workshops.
<p>The APIStrat Un-workshops were broken into two main groups, API design and Internet of things, while each of the un-workshops started with lightning talks from relative providers, the rest of the un-workshops were just open conversations around a table between all participants&mdash;making them very organic discussions.
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t get a chance to participate at Gluecon, the conversations will continue online with blot posts from each of the group leaders in the discussions on API Evangelist, as well as at A<a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">PI Strategy &amp; Practice</a>, where we will be structuring sessions, panels and more workshops to keep the dialogue going.

        <span class="post-date">23 May 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-design.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>In 2014 <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">API design</a> is exploding, proving to be one of the fastest growing areas of the API industry. For many years we&rsquo;ve talked purely about API management, but after consolidation in the space, and serious growth, the conversation has shifted.
<p>The API conversation is moving upstream in the API lifecycle, focusing on designing, mocking, and collaborating around designing the best quality APIs possible, that will meet the needs of consumers--before any code is written and deployed.
<p>A new wave of API design companies have zeroed in on supporting healthy API design practices by providing tools like <a href="https://apiary.io">Apiary.io</a> which allow you to mock, design and collaborate early on in API design process. This new wave of tools and service is meant to foster the healthiest possible design practices, and is cultivating an expanding army of knowledgeable API designers, who demonstrate that API design can be more art than science and technology.
<p>Amid this rapid expansion we are witnessing the potentially damaging effects of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/10/where-will-your-api-stand-in-the-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-debate/">Oracle v Google legal battle</a>, which is looking to inject unnecessary concerns around copyright into this blossoming API design sector. What will the copyright of APIs do to the API design process?
<p>Will API design be as creative when you have to be concerned with designing unique interfaces vs creating with the best of breed API design patterns that are already available in the space? Will you design for quality of interfaces, the needs of your consumers and interoperability, the lifeblood of APIs, when you are focused on copyright and your API definitions become about legal protection and not access and innovation as they were intended?
<p>If the precedent is set that copyright indeed applies to web APIs, I think that one of the chilling waves that will ripple through the industry will be extremely visible in the API design layer. API definitions are not one of the layers where control and monetization should be applied, allowing for more creative energy to exist,  rather than being all business&mdash;monetization should occur in the API or front-end applications. Period.

<p>API discovery has not changed much since 2005, when <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/30/history-of-apis--programmableweb/">John Musser launched ProgrammableWeb</a>, the API directory we've all come to know and love. In 2014 (9 years later), we have <a href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a> and a handful of other API directory and discovery tools, but we have not made progress on truly being able to discover the best APIs possible, in a distributed, machine-readable way.
<p>Steve Willmott of <a title="3Scale" href="https://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, and Kin Lane of <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, are at it again, looking to provide a possible solution, that we are calling APIs.json&mdash;a machine readable listing of your APIs and supporting building blocks that lives in the root of your domain.
<p>The objective of APIs.json is to help fix this problem by making it easy for people to signpost where the APIs on a given domain are and provide information on how they work. The format is simple and extensible and can be put into any web root domain for discovery.
<p>We are just getting started, so make sure and get involved via the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json">Github repository </a>or via the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apisjson">Google Group</a> we've setup to facilitate discussion.

<p>I&rsquo;m torn on a matter that I face when reviewing APIs for companies. I get emails from people who want me to review their API implementation, and they state they want public developers to get excited about an API, but the program isn't fully available out in the open. Most often these APIs just have some sort of landing page, which is really just a press release, and email address of someone to contact to gain access.
<p>I&rsquo;m all for people being able to have any grade of privacy for their APIs ranging from internal to completely public, but I just it difficult when API providers express interest in public developers learning about and potentially using an API, but don't provide any of the common building blocks developers are used to with a modern API. In my mind, if you are courting public developers, you should provide as much information as you possibly can, and manage access at the registration and API access levels.
<p>In the end I guess I'm just exploring the best way to educate companies about the benefits of opening up, provide more information about their developer program, helping them understand that this how it is done with modern web APIs. With the right on-boarding, and API management strategy you can control who actually gets access to your API, and I can't think of why you would want to hide documentation, forums, code libraries, app showcases and other things for an API that is generally available to the public.
<p>In 2014, if you are going to provide API resources to the public, you should expose as much of the developers area and as man of the supporting building block to the public as you can. At least talk through each one, and discuss the pros and cons of this being public. In a world where there are over 10K APIs available, it can be difficult to stand out, and the more public you are, the more chance developers will understand what you are offering.

<p>As I&rsquo;m working to add yet another API example to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/what-are-some-good-examples-of-hypermedia-apis/">my growing list of hypermedia APIs in the wild</a>, I can't help but think about the long evolution of hypermedia, and how it will eventually become part of the mainstream API consciousness.
<p>I first started following the often heated discussions around hypermedia a couple years ago as leading API technologists began discussing this significant evolution in API design. Hypermedia has numerous benefits and features, but one you often hear in discussions is that if we use hypermedia we can stop designing custom clients that consume APIs.
<p>The logic is that if every API call comes bundled with URLs for discovering and navigating the resources that are made available via an API, clients can just use this as a blueprint for any app to API interactions. This became a fairly large argument between hypermedia architects and hypermedia haters, something that I think turned a lot of people off to the concept, forcing us to stick with many of the bad habits we already knew.
<p>As I review these new hypermedia APIs, few of them are perfect by any hypermedia measurement, but they use the sensible portions of hypermedia discovery and navigation to deliver a better API experience for developers. I don't think API providers are doing it because of the perfect hypermedia vision we've heard articulated in the past, they are borrowing the pieces that make sense to them and that meet their goals.
<p>Someday we may achieve a world where API clients aren't custom, with every application automatically knowing how to discover, interact, and navigate any API resource it will need. However I think in the currently reality, we will see hypermedia being adopted because it just makes sense as a next step for sensible API design, and this is how we should communicate it to curious API designers, looking to understand exactly what is this concept called hypermedia.

        <span class="post-date">15 May 2014</span>

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen a significant growth in the number of APIs in government, but to date most of these APIs are read-only, meaning you can just retrieve content or data from these APIs, not actually add, update or delete any of the resources made available via these APis.
<p>I've written about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/25/a-rare-beast-in-government-the-write-api/">lack of write APIs in government before</a>, trying to kickstart the conversation amongst existing API advocates at various agencies, and <a href="https://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/write_apis-notes.html">now 18F, the elite tech group at the GSA is doing the same</a>. 18F has a page dedicated to the conversation around write APIs in government, with eight active examples of write APIs, nine potential examples, and two that are "under consideration".
<p>What 18F is doing, is a key part of the process that will demonstrate to existing API owners at government agencies, that write APIs are possible, by showcasing the existing implementations, as well as others that are under development. Agencies need clear examples to follow, reassuring them that this is possible in government, giving them potential mentors, and in some cases incentivize agencies by making them feel they are behind the curve, and missing out on opportunities to lead when serving their constituents.
<p>The importance thate government agencies have read / write APIs goes beyond the obvious benefits around content and data being more complete and up to date--a two way street, when it comes to API operations requires a more dedicated approach, bringing agencies closer to both private and public sector partners who will be consuming and contributing to the API(s). This process reduces the chance an API will be launched and forgotten about, which really does nobody any good, and contributes to giving APIs in government a bad name.
<p>If you work at a federal agency, or are a contractor working on APIs within government, make sure and <a href="https://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/write_apis-notes.html">reach out to 18F</a> and see how you can be part of this significant change in how federal government operates. For all of this API stuff to work, APIs in government must be a two way street.

<p>To help get people up to speed on APIs, Zapier&rsquo;s introduction has eight chapters covering the big picture:

        <span class="post-date">14 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/oauth-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>A couple of weeks ago I attended a two day API specification session between major California utilities, <a href="https://www.sce.com">Southern California Edison</a> (SCE), <a href="http://www.sdge.com/">San Diego Gas &amp; Electric</a> (SDG&amp;E), and <a href="http://www.pge.com/">Pacific Gas and Electric</a> (PG&amp;E), that was organized by Hypertek Inc. for <a href="http://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST), that is looking to push forward the <a href="http://www.greenbuttondata.org/">Green Button data</a> and API agenda of the White House and Department of Energy.
<p>The <a href="https://energyos.github.io/OpenESPI-GreenButton-API-Documentation/">Green Button API and open data model already exists</a>, but the current hurdle for the initiative is to get leading utilities to agree to specific implementation definitions that serve their customers, so it can be ratified as a standard. This entire two day session was dedicated to walking through line by line, and establish the oAuth scope that each of the three utility companies would implementing when providing Green Button data via the API to 3rd party developers, who are building solutions for utility customers.
<p>An example of this in the wild, would be if a utility customer wanted to get a quote for a rooftop solar installation, the installer could use a software solution that was developed by a 3rd party vendor, that pulls that customers energy usage via the Green Button API, and generate a precise quote for the number of solar panels they&rsquo;d need to cover their energy usage. Now this is just one example of how energy data could be used, but a very powerful and relevant one in 2014, that give customers access and control over their data.
<p>Before we even get there, the Green Button API definition, data model, and oAuth scope has to be finalized with utility providers, before it can be submitted as a standard&mdash;with the final oAuth scope being what will be agreed to by each 3rd party developer that integrates with each utility's Green Button API. This oAuth scope sets the tone for the conversation that 3rd party software providers, and vendors can ultimately have with utility customers around their private utility data.
<p>In my opinion this is one potential model for how industry operations will be negotiated in the future. While not all API definitions, data models and oAuth scopes will be defined by the government then negotiated with industries, but oAuth will be where this scope is negotiated between industry leaders and governments, no matter which side leads the conversation. Governments and industries working together to define API standards is nothing new, but what is new, is the presence of the oAuth layer which gives end-users, and citizens an active role. 3rd party developers and end-users do not get a place in the negotiations, but they do when it comes to putting valuable industry data to use in new ways--or not, which will flow back upstream and influence future iterations of APIs, data models and oAuth scope.
<p>This introduction of the oAuth layer in how industries operate, potentially coupled with the access and innovation that can occur via API platforms when they are executed in alignment with modern API implementations, will change how industries grow and ultimately how power flows (pun intended). This evolution in how the public and private sector partner will not always positive by default, I&rsquo;m not an API solutionist in that I believe APIs bless everything as good, but with the right players at the table, a little sunlight and transparency in the process, and a feedback loop that includes 3rd party developers and end-users, we might be able to implement meaningful change across many different industries around the globe.

<p>There is a laundry list of problems with the current state of terms of service, affectionality called TOS--those legal documents we all agree to as part of our usage of online services, and are defining relationships between API providers and their consumers. API Voice is dedicated to exploring this, and other building blocks that make up the politics of APIs, an area you will see increased coverage of in 2014.
<p>As I continue to develop a better understanding of how API terms of service influence the API economy, I can't help but think one of the fundamental flaws of API terms of use is that there is no room for negotiation. Earlier this month I <a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/01/would-you-pay-for-alternate-options-for-an-api-terms-of-service/">explored the concept of being able to pay for alternate options within a terms of service</a>, as part of my ongoing journey towards a machine readable TOS.
<p>I strongly believe that to fully realize the API economy as many of us technologists see it, the terms of service have to be machine readable, allowing for seamless integration into the other political building blocks like privacy policies, service level agreements, partner access tiers, and pricing. If you think about it, current API terms of service reflect the command and control governance style of SOA, not the flexible, agile and innovative approach that APIs are often known for.
<p>Why aren't API terms of service negotiable? Well they are, it just isn't built into the existing API platform. Many API ecosystem allow for circumventing and negotiating at the terms of service level behind closed doors, with partners, and API consumers who share the same investors, it just isn't a conversation that occurs out in the open. This approach reflects legacy ways of doing business, where if you are in the know, have the right connections, you can negotiate, and not the new API driven approach that will allow the API economy to scale as required.
<p>The ability for API consumers to negotiate the terms of service isn't something that we can just roll out overnight, it is something we have to evolve towards over time. I&rsquo;m hoping to help facilitate this evolution, through brainstorming, stories and conversations around the potential of machine readable terms of service, here on API Voice over the next couple of years.

If you have never been to Gluecon or Defrag, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/11/how-to-defrag-your-brain-and-tech-career-in-november/">read some of my previous posts about just how different the event is</a>. Gluecon has brought together tech leaders, who have helped define the API space for the last six years, to a small resort in Colorado, creating an environment for conversation I have not experienced anywhere else.
<p>This year Gluecon is exceptionally special for me, because 3Scale and API Evangelist are doing a special first day of un-workshop discussions on API design and the Internet of Things and Realtime, continuing the <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> conversation. You can find all the <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Gluecon/">details over at the APIStrat site,</a> and even register and be part of the conversation.
<p>The topic of API design has dominated my blog traffic, with every story I do on the subject filling the top 10 most visited posts for the last 3 months. The conversation of how to design APIs has exploded, with the introduction of languages and tooling from Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML, and as we realize that API design is more art than science&mdash;something that developers and business leaders should all be part of. The first Gluecon / APIStrat un-workshop is dedicated to this fast growing area of the API sector.
<p>In 2014 you can&rsquo;t have a conversation about APIs without discussing the next wave of Internet enabled devices&mdash;dubbed Internet of Things (Iot). We are seeing a new breed of APIs, and frameworks emerge that don&rsquo;t just connect devices to the Internet, but also facilitate realtime communications between devices and the cloud&mdash;merging realtime and Iot.  The second Gluecon / APIStrat un-workshop is bringing together a wide range of practitioners to discuss what is next for APIs in the context of realtime IoT.
<p>It isn&rsquo;t too late to get your tickets to Gluecon and <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Gluecon/">register for the APIStrat un-workshops</a>. Tickets to Denver are pretty inexpensive from most places in the country, even at this late date. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the conversations that I&rsquo;ll have at Gluecon, both in the sessions, the hallway in-between, and the taproom late into the night--I will see you there!

<p>I was invited to <a href="https://actiac.org/MOC2014">moderate a workshop panel in Maryland next week at the The American Council for Technology (ACT) - Industry Advisory Council (IAC) Management of Change 2014 event</a>. If you arenat familiar with ACT-IAC, they are a non-profit, public-private partnership dedicated to improving government through the application of information technology--with the event bringing government leaders together, and discussing open data, open source, and APIs.
<p>The workshop is described as:
<blockquote><em>Open Data isn&rsquo;t just data sets. It&rsquo;s APIs, it&rsquo;s open source and, most importantly &mdash; it&rsquo;s people. Working within these new concepts and methods requires a change in culture by our programs, executives, and contracting offices. In order to execute on providing open source to the public, we need new skills for the workforce that let us contract appropriately, and learn how to design our systems from the ground up with APIs and open source in mind.</em></blockquote>
<p>I will be leading the discussion between a panel of  X subject matter experts:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Kevin Youel-Page</strong> - Assistant Commissioner, Integrated Award Environment, General Services Administration</li>
<li><strong>Dan Gahafer</strong> - Forge.mil Program Manager, Defense Information Systems Agency</li>

I&rsquo;m looking forward to what I, and the rest of the event, can learn from these government leaders regarding how they are using open data, open source software, and APIs to effect change within their agencies.
<p>The fact that we are having conversations like this at the highest levels of government in 2014, after four years of API evangelism, makes me hopeful that we are making progress, in not just changing how we do business, or how the government operates, but also how the private and public sector both work together in the emerging API economy.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/05/12/gathering-my-thoughts-with-apis-in-higher-education/">Gathering My Thoughts With APIs In Higher Education</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 May 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/priorities/university-of-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I had too many scribbles in my Evernote about work I&rsquo;m doing for <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/index.html">APIs in higher education</a>, so I decided I need to publish as a story, which hopefully will help me organize my thoughts, figure out my next moves, and share what I&rsquo;m doing to a couple of folks who asked what I&rsquo;m up to in this area.
<p><strong>APIs In Higher Education Institutions</strong><br /> To keep API Evangelist operating I have some very supportive partners who invest in my research, and one of the areas <a href="https://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a>&nbsp;and I work together on is understanding how APIs are currently being used in higher education. As part of my recent research I went back through the <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/index.html">universities I track on</a> who have APIs, to see whats changed, and I stumbled upon the fact that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/23/browsing-the-261-apis-at-brigham-young-university/">BYU&rsquo;s API inventory has grown to a mind blowing 261 APIs</a>, covering almost all aspects of university operations.
<p>I will be continuing this research on what BYU is up to, but also the 10 other institutions I&rsquo;m tracking on, and as I do with other areas of the API space, try to identify some of the common building blocks universities are employing&mdash;hoping to create a blueprint that other institutions can follow.  You can find all this research, kindly supported by <a href="https://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a>, up on the <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/index.html">Github repository designated for the project</a>.
<p><strong>Dept of Education and FAFSA API</strong><br />Beyond the general use of APIs by universities, last November I started working on a <a href="https://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/">prototype of an API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid or FAFSA form</a>, looking to jump start a conversation at the Department of Education around APIs. It worked, and in January they announced that they would looking to get feedback on what an API for FAFSA would look like.
<p>Behind the scenes I was contacted to provide a proposal for a FAFSA API, hoping to chase after some budget that could fund such a project. I worked for two days on a proposal, submitted, but haven&rsquo;t heard anything more about what happened to that budget chase.
<p>Then in April, the <a href="https://www.ed.gov/blog/2014/04/how-can-the-department-of-education-increase-innovation-transparency-and-access-to-data/">Department of Education asked the public to weigh in on an RFI around APIs</a> not just for FAFSA, but at the Department of Education in general. I need another week or so to gather up all of my work from the last six months around APIs in higher education, and the Department of Education, then probably write another story or two and respond to the RFI before the June deadline.
<p><strong>Reclaim Your Domain</strong><br /> I went down to Atlanta to participate in a talk about the domain of one&rsquo;s own program at Emory University, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/05/01/exploring-the-domain-universe-at-emory-university/">you can read more about it in an earlier pos</a>t. I&rsquo;m feeling a seismic shift in my world, and telling stories about using APIs to reclaim your content and data, is something I will be talking about a lot more. What is really fascinating for me is that the inspiration for doing this work to help individuals better understand and control their online world is coming out of leading higher education institutions like MIT, University of Mary Washington and Emory. You can follow <a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/">my personal reclaim project on Github</a> for real-time updates in this area of my work.
<p><strong>Data &amp; Analytics MOOC At UT Arlington</strong><br /> In addition to Atlanta, I was i<a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/05/01/apis-edx-tableau-google-at-ut-arlington/">n Arlington TX talking about the role APIs could play in a data and analytics MOOC at UT Arlington</a>. While the goal was to understand how students can use APIs to better explore data &amp; analytics, I left thinking about APIs for edX, and how we can develop a single course or group landing page that allows teachers and students to aggregate profiles and content using APIs and oAuth&mdash;a project I will be working on more using <a href="https://oauth.io/">oAuth.io</a>.
<p><strong>APIs and edX</strong><br /> While in Texas I had the pleasure of hanging out with the <a href="https://www.edx.org/how-it-works">folks from edX</a>, the online course platform that offers interactive online classes and MOOCs from MITx, HarvardX, BerkeleyX, UTx and other universities, and of course we got talking APIs. An API is in their roadmap, but definitely something I would like to explore more as well here on the blog. I can&rsquo;t imagine any online learning solution, between universities being successful in 2014 without an API! ;-)
<p><strong>Ok, Now What's Next?</strong><br /> I think that is it. I just needed to write all that down, after a crazy couple of weeks. Now it is easier to see the main action items:
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Respond to Department of Education RFI</li>
<li>Create v1 of a APIs in higher education blueprint</li>
<li>Push forward with my personal Reclaim Your Domain</li>
<li>Develop class or group profile and content aggregation page that runs on Github using oAuth.io</li>
<li>Think about what an API program would look like for edX</li>
<li>Pull together a list of good APIs that could be used in a data &amp; analytics course</li>
</ul>
<p>That gives me six clear action items to move forward with, out of this hectic slice of my API research pie&mdash;higher education. I think if I can push forward with this chunk of work I can further kickstart the conversation around healthy API usage across higher education.
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m biased, because of my proximity to <a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>, but I&rsquo;m hoping that the university is where we can make the biggest impact in educating people about the opportunities and the dangers of APIs.

        <span class="post-date">10 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-voice/oraclevgoogle/oraclevgoogle.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I wanted to comment on the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-voice/oraclevgoogle/223105653-Oracle-Google-Java-Appeal-Decision.pdf" target="_blank">response yesterday in the Oracle v. Google case being played out in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a>. This appeal is important to me because it will not just set the tone for how APIs are designed, deployed and managed, but also because <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/11/02/help-eff-make-case-for-no-copryight-on-apis/">I worked with the EFF to craft the Amicus Brief</a>, and <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/oracle-v-google/amici">signed on as one of the computer scientists</a> in opposition of API copyright--making the response a huge blow to me personally.
<p>The case is far from settled, so I will refrain from using hyperbole when I describe the situation, but will echo the EFF&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/dangerous-ruling-oracle-v-google-federal-circuit-reverses-sensible-lower-court">the implications of this decision are significant, and dangerous</a>&rdquo;.  For me, it doesn&rsquo;t change the conversation, it just re-enforces what I already believe, and hopefully it will do the same amongst API providers across the space.
<p>Steve Willmott of <a href="https://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> and I read the writing on the wall when we started <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> last year, that a political line was being drawn by the Oracle v Google appeal, and would not just continue to play out in the courts, but also within the heart of the API economy, and that we needed to collectively stand up and push back--API Commons is a back-burn strategy for the wildfire that Oracle has set.
<p>API Commons basically declares that API definitions are ultimately copyrightable or licensable as code, depending on your viewpoint, all you do is hang your definition in the API Commons, and provide a reference to the license that matters to you, whether it <a href="https://twitter.com/mamund/status/464907589294116865">licensed as content (CC) or software (FSF)</a>&nbsp;is your call. Giving every API provider a torch, and the ability to participate in setting the back-burn, taking a stance in the Oracle v Google wildfire that has been set by Oracle, that could potentially burn down all of our collective resources.
<p>In my opinion, Oracle v Google is just one of many battles that will occur within this new, virtual layer of our economy, and will ultimately define whether a company's approach to delivering digital services is more about governance and monetization (SOA), or about access and innovation (API)&mdash;exposing heart of the SOA v API debate.
<p>Changing my metaphor from forest fire being set by Oracle, to seeing the API economy as an engine&mdash;Oracle is replacing the engine oil with glue, and then enabling any company to sell you a solvent + oil to make it better. If the API economy is our baby, Oracle is introducing smoke and alcohol into the womb, which will stunt the growth of the space, and impact not just the rest of us, but also stupidly Oracle&rsquo;s own revenue. Ok I lied, I got all fired up and shifted into hyperbolic gear! ;-) Vrooom!!
<p>I spend a lot of time trying to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/26/what-can-the-enterprise-learn-from-the-open-api-space/">help the enterprise understand what makes APIs work versus their latest SOA approach</a>, and often times I find explaining this difference is akin to teaching dark matter and physics, or the concept of evolution to evangelical christians in rural america. The enterprise is blind to many of the elements that make APIs work, with all the vital elements lost in the quest for profit and control within the industries they operate in.
<p>Generating a machine readable definition of your API, with accompanying licensing model, is just <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/10/the-levers-dials-and-switches-for-your-participation-in-the-api-economy/">going to be one more lever we will have to adjust when dialing in the political settings for our APIs</a>, which sucks big-time, but ultimately is doable with the leadership demonstrated by API providers across startups, SMS, enterprise, government, and non governmental organizations when they submit their API definitions to the API Commons, accompanied with a liberal or publicly available license.
<p>As new API discovery models emerge, and <a href="http://api500.com/">API ratings models evolve</a>, the license of your API definition will set the tone for the conversation you have with your API consumers. As the usage of machine readable API definitions grows, and API discovery and rating becomes automated, your API licensing will be the difference in whether or not your API even shows up in a search result, or not.
<p>You will have to excuse my brief rant, in response to the Oracle v Google appeal. I currently have the flu after being in Germany for API Days Berlin, and finding it difficult to formulate a coherent, lengthy response. Much like the overall debate, I think I will have to break the response from the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit down, publish as bite-size chunks that will stimulate discussion via my <a href="http://apivoice.com">API Voice</a> blog over time, and evolve my own understanding--refining my arguments.&nbsp;
<p>The discussion around API copyright is far from over. I don&rsquo;t have much hope for the results of the fair use discussion, that will continue as part of the case, but I do have hope when it comes to API providers stepping up to take a stance on the subject. Additionally, Oracle can count on me being the "Johnny Fucking Appleseed of API Definitions", convincing companies, organizations and governments of all sizes to publish their API definitions to the commons. Then also being as prolific in designing and defining the next generation of APIs ahead of the enterprise, as I am in writing on my blog(s), making sure that the best API design patterns are openly licensed and put into the commons for everyone to use--before your slow, bloated enteprise can even understand what the hell is going on.
<p>Game on! Fuck you Oracle!

        <span class="post-date">07 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/acme/acme-corp.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>I just turned down a potential partnership with a major enterprise company. As I do with many stories, I will scrub the names of those involved, because there is no reason to blame a single company, this is a lesson any large entity can learn from&mdash;for this story, we&rsquo;ll just call them Acme Inc.
<p>Acme Inc. contacted me a couple weeks ago, stating they were looking to do some research into the API space, and have been following my work for some time. After a few emails we made time to get on the phone and talk about what each of us were up to.
<p>We spent about an hour, where I gave my history, why I do API Evangelist, and how I go about generating short form, and long form content as part of my research across the API space. Acme Inc. shared their interest in exploring how APIs could be applied to a couple of business sectors, and were looking to generate white paper(s) that they could distribute internally, and amongst partners.
<p>Acme was extremely vague on details, and I understand that not everyone can be as open as me, especially when you work at a big company. We ended the call, agreeing that we&rsquo;d explore what a potential partnership might look like, around research projects, but they would need me to sign an NDA first&mdash;no problem.
<p>I received an NDA via email a couple days later, as I was on my way to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/01/business-of-internal-apis-at-ibm-impact-last-tuesday/">IBM Impact in Las Vegas</a>, and while I was busy in Las Vegas I received an a reminder to please sign the agreement. When I was done in Las Vegas, on my way to  <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/05/01/apis-edx-tableau-google-at-ut-arlington/">Texas for another engagement</a>, I signed the NDA, printed a PDF and sent it back.  A few days later, as I was leaving Texas, on my way home to LA for about 8 hours, before <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/01/i-will-be-speaking-at-apidays-in-berlin-next-week/">I left to Berlin</a>, I received another email requesting that I sign a second NDA, this time using a digital signature solution.
<p>At this point my inbox was already out of control, and I boarded the 12 hour flight Berlin, and proceeded to gear up for <a href="http://berlin.apidays.io/">APIDays Berlin</a>. After a day in Berlin where I finished my talk (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">which I rewrote onsite to better suit the local audience</a>), and two days of the amazing interactions at API Days Berlin, I finally made it back into my inbox.
<p>This time I found another reminder, to sign the digital copy of NDA. At this point, I&rsquo;ve received 2 separate NDAs, and two reminders to please sign the NDA--ith no knowledge of what the ideas are. Maybe these are ideas or research I&rsquo;m already working on? Who the fuck knows!
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLFO4ZV0i4&amp;feature=kp"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/acme/dont-give-fuck.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<p>I just sent an email to my Acme representative, stating that I will regretfully decline the partnership, and summarized my feelings. Acme thanked me.
<p>With this response, I probably blew off thousands of dollars in revenue, and who knows what else. In the end I don&rsquo;t give a fuck. What I do is not about revenue or showcasing partnerships with global companies. It is about ideas, research and my storytelling, whether it is short form (blog) or longer form (whtie papers), or in person, and always in a way that provides value to the community.
<p>I understand that a large entity cannot operate like I do--I&rsquo;m not naive. However when it comes to the world of APIs, if you want to play, you have to learn to open up, and at least be able to have conversations without the need for an NDA. People in the enterprise might fuck you over at every turn, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but I do not.</span> You can ask me to keep something private, and I will&mdash;end of story.
<p>This is the fundamental difference between APIs and SOA that so many enterprise practitioners do not understand. As an individual I am so much happier being able to openly share my ideas, stories, code, and other resources publicly, in a way that is openly licensed, and most importantly&mdash;accessible by everyone. I strongly feel that there is a lot for the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/26/what-can-the-enterprise-learn-from-the-open-api-space/">enterprise to learn from the world of open APIs</a>, which isn&rsquo;t just about technology.  However, I&rsquo;m gambling that most of them will never give a flying fuck.

        <span class="post-date">07 May 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.greenbuttondata.org/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/federal-government/green-button/green-button.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
<p>One of the most meaningful API projects I work on with the US government is the <a href="https://energyos.github.io/OpenESPI-GreenButton-API-Documentation/">Green Button AP</a>I, which provides access to energy data for US consumers across the country.  First, what is the Green Button API? The Green Button builds on top of the Green Button data initiative which is:
<blockquote><em>...an industry-led effort that responds to a White House call-to-action: provide electricity customers with easy access to their energy usage data in a consumer-friendly and computer-friendly format via a "Green Button" on electric utilities' website.</em></blockquote>
<p>Which Todd Park, Assistant to the President and U.S. Chief Technology Officer states:
<blockquote><em>Giving residential and commercial customers secure access to their own energy data in a standard, easy-to-understand format will help them visualize their energy use and identify opportunities to save money. At the same time, Green Button is spurring the development of new online tools and services that add value to this information, creating an innovative new domain for entrepreneurship and job creation.</em></blockquote>
<p>The Green Button API delivers flexible access to Energy Usage Information through a set of RESTful interfaces, providing access any consumers Green Button data. The Green Button API is being designed by <a href="https://www.energyos.org/">EnergyOS</a>, providing a solution that any utility can download and run to mediate access between their retail energy customers, and 3rd parties who will provide energy data driven services to them.
<p>I&rsquo;m very excited to announce that the Green Button API definition has been added to the <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>. The Green Button API represents why 3Scale and API Evangelist launched API Commons, to provide a place where we can hang the most important, and meaningful API interfaces, and underlying data models, to encourage re-use.
<p>You can find the <a href="https://energyos.github.io/OpenESPI-GreenButton-API-Documentation/API/api-docs">Swagger specification for the Green Button API on Github</a>, complete with <a href="https://energyos.github.io/OpenESPI-GreenButton-API-Documentation/API/">interactive documentation</a> and other resources. The project is a work in progress, with the final specification still being hammered out by EnergyOS and utilities across the country, but the API is fully functional, and since it is on Github&mdash;the <a href="https://github.com/energyos/OpenESPI-GreenButton-API-Documentation/issues">entire project is open for comment</a>.
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to know more about the project, feel free to contact me directly at <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/apicommons">@apicommons</a>.

<p>I heard an interesting statement this week at <a href="http://berlin.apidays.io/">APIDays Berlin</a> that I&rsquo;ve heard before, "API document is an bug not a feature". The logic behind this is that if you design a proper API, using proven REST and hypermedia patterns, you shouldn&rsquo;t need documentation.
<p>While this is true, and I agree with 100%, it ignores the vital process of getting the average person up to speed--simply stating that what many of us are actively doing, and what we currently know is a bug. I work with any folks who barely know what an API is, or what JSON is, yet have a lot of influence and control over whether some very important APIs exist, or not!
<p>I know that these API experts are speaking to the correct path that we should be taking, yet there is very little consideration to understanding where most folks are on the path, and how many forks there are in the road, before we get to where we need to be.
<p>To help those understand the path, think of the numerous APIs in the past with no documentation, then all of a sudden static API documentation was the norm, and now in 2014, interactive documentation has become commonplace.
<p>Alongside this journey the debate around REST, and recently hypermedia has been going on, with only recently getting to a place where healthy patterns are being used across many APIs, not just a handful of demos.
<p>Understanding this will help you see the path that we are on. A path that we can only move down at a certain speed, because it takes careful education and planning to move not just developers, but business leaders down. Maybe eventually the path will be a highway, and at some point a freeway that we can get more people down, but for now it takes a lot of planning to shepherding to move everyone along.
<p>I fully respect those that wish to exclusively remain in the academic discussion of API design and deployment. As this is a layer of the space that I follow very closely and use to educate myself, and pull valuable ideas and information from, while telling stories on my blog.
<p>However, my goal with this post is to help recruit the next generation of evangelists, who closely follow the leading edge of the API sector and where we should be going, but also want to help understand how to build a roadmap to help get the rest of the world, safely down the path to where we should be, with storytelling that can reach the masses.

<p>We live in a very exciting time, one where the resources we need to build meaningful websites and applications, that have the opportunity to impact how we do business, and potentially make change in how the world around us, is rapidly expanding. Once upon a time, many of these digital resources took millions of dollars of investment to deliver, if they were available at all. Now, with the introduction of web APIs, many valuable resources are available in a self-service, pay as you go manner, allowing anyone to integrate these valuable resources their own business or personal worlds.
<h3>History of APIs</h3>
<p>Over the last 14 years of the Internet, companies have been using a new approach to APIs, built on the same technology that drives the web&mdash;HTTP.  Web APIs are not a new, proprietary way of building applications on the Internet, but a way of delivering the vital resources web and mobile applications need, side by side with the same websites that humans consume&mdash;except APIs are raw data, minus the visuals that a human would require, enabling developers to deliver exactly the experience that end users will need.
<p><strong>Delivering On Original Visions of Digital Commerce</strong><br /> This low cost approach to deliver resources on the web has been pioneered by tech giants like SalesForce in delivering the next generation of customer relationship management, and sales in the clouds. We&rsquo;ve also seen web APIs transform world of ecommerce from tech giants like Amazon, and shift auctions online from eBay. The payments needed to transact in this new world of commerce also emerged via APIs from Paypal, and a newer generation of payment API providers like Stripe.
<p><strong>A Social Web</strong><br /> The distributed effect of web APIs allowed for the evolution of a new type of online interaction, dubbed &ldquo;social&rdquo;. Early innovators applied web APIs to digital media such as photos from Flickr, and then quickly was applied to the sharing of Internet links or bookmarks by Delicious. Once these pioneers paved the way, a next generation of social platforms were born with the emergence of Twitter and Facebook. All of these social platforms employed web APIs as the driver for all social interactions via the web, that contributed to their growth and user adoption.
<p><strong>Migrating Compute Into The Cloud</strong><br /> After their success with commerce APIs, Amazon internalize the deployment of APIs in a way that gave birth to how we deploy and scale compute and storage, forever changing how develop applications with the introduction of Amazon Web Services. Amazon started with a dead simple storage API called Amazon S3, then shortly after rolled out the ability to deploy server instances in the cloud via web APIs with Amazon EC2&mdash;providing two of the essential building blocks for building apps online.
<p><strong>Geo-locating In A Digital World</strong><br /> As we were getting our bearings in this new digital world we created for ourselves, the search pioneer Google began innovating in the world of online mapping. Shortly after noticing that users were hacking and extending the JavaScript driven Google Maps, they began designing a web API that would meet the needs of the web and the soon to emerge world of mobile apps&mdash;giving everyone the first in a long line of essential API driven Geo resources we would need to make the web mobile.
<p><strong>Messaging For The Cloud</strong><br /> As the web began its collision with the emerging world of mobile devices, a new breed of API driven messaging resources emerged, first around SMS and voice from Twilio, then evolving standard messaging formats like email, from SendGrid. However it doesn&rsquo;t stop with just extending existing messaging standards via APIs, companies like Context.io are completely redefining how we approach traditional email messaging with their API driven messaging solutions.
<h3>What Makes Web APIs So Appealing?</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-shipping-containers.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>The wealth of individual resources has made the world of APIs very appealing to developers, but this approach to deploying very modular, web-based resources was also proven valuable to companies when exposing their own resources, for internal development, extending access to partners, and in some cases making available to the general public and open developers.
<p><strong>Granular Resources</strong><br /> With web APIs you are taking the minimum viable portion of a resource and making available over the Internet. A contact, an image, or any other piece of data, content or programmatic resource, and make it securely accessible on the Internet. This modular, granular approach to defining and providing access to resources allows for the remix, and reuse of resources in a very efficient way across all possible systems, web or mobile applications, and increasingly any Internet connected object.
<p><strong>Distributed Resources</strong><br /> Since web APIs are built using HTTP, the underlying infrastructure of the Internet, they are distributed in nature, and globally scalable&mdash;just like the web. This approach to delivering APIs allow for resources to be accessed internally by systems and applications, across the globe by external groups and partners--any potential consumer with Internet access. Defining digital assets as APIs allow for distributed access, by existing consumers, while ensuring they are immediately available to any future need that may arise.
<p><strong>Agility and Nimbleness</strong><br /> With digital assets defined in such a granular, distributed manner, a new agility begins to emerge. Companies who once took months or years to expose data and content sources, and securely provide access, can now open up access potentially in real-time to company and organization wide resources. APIs are all about access and re-use, allowing companies to save time and money when integrating existing assets into web and mobile apps at speeds they never could imagine before.
<p><strong>Research, Development, And Innovation</strong><br /> With valuable assets securely available on the Internet, all resources are available for research and development, allowing for new types of innovation to occur. APIs are external by nature, establishing an R&amp;D lab of sorts, for companies to experiment with new types of product and services, in an environment that encourages outside participation, establishing a rich environment for new ideas to flourish.
<h3>What Have We Learned?</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-question-mark.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<p>Challenging the top down planning approaches of earlier API movements like SOA, web APIs have produced some valuable lessons in deploying application infrastructure that focuses on simplicity, rapid iterations, and bottom-up, grassroots evolution of how a service oriented architecture is designed, deployed, managed and evolved.  Studying the approaches from API pioneers, as well as the current waves of public API deployments provide numerous lessons that other companies, organizations, and government agencies can learn from. Let&rsquo;s walk through some of the biggest lessons from the world of APIs.
<p><strong>Technology of APIs</strong><br /> Over the last 14 years suite of technological approaches to designing, deploying and operating APIs have won out, not just through standards, but through organic experimentation, proven through success. Modern web APIs start with pragmatic REST, which uses HTTP and follows Roy Fielding's recommendations for making the web not just consumable, but also programmable. To support API interaction, a new data exchange format has emerged&mdash;JSON is the lightweight, preferred data interaction format for API consumers. Finally, to secure APIs, a standard called oAuth has emerged handling not just the identity of application users, but handles the authorization and access of underling resources available via an API.
<p><strong>Business of APIs</strong><br /> The success of web APIs is only partially a technical thing, a large part of web APIs success is driven from their business approaches. We&rsquo;ve learned that simple, clean and centralized consumer portals, with complete documentation, and supporting code are essential to on-boarding, and helping consumer achieve a successful integration. API providers have also established sophisticated communication strategies for their API operations including blogs, active Twitter and other social media accounts, and community forums within their ecosystem and outside them on existing developer communities like Stack Overflow. All of these supporting business elements help ensure the technical operations of an API are known and supported, providing what is needed for consumers to be successful.
<p><strong>Politics of APIs</strong><br /> APIs are not inherently good, bad or neutral when it comes to company operations, partnerships and public access. There are several aspects of the political side of APIs that ensure consumer success, starting but not limited to sensible, flexible terms of service that protect a company's assets, but also allow developers to innovate. API providers throttle access to valuable resources by establishing rate limits, multiple pricing levels, and access tiers for API consumers, allowing for the generation of revenue, but in a way that encourages healthy consumption by integrated applications. The security and reliability of an API also plays a significant role in an APIs overall image, on-boarding process, and access to a platforms API resources. All of these elements provide the political grease that makes API integrations flow, with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/10/the-levers-dials-and-switches-for-your-participation-in-the-api-economy/">many different knobs and levers that can be pulled, loosened, or tightened for the delivering optimal results</a>.
<p><strong>API Design</strong><br /> In the last couple years, leading API practitioners have demonstrated that API design is more art than science. Good API design isn't always about just getting busy coding, and are using mock API interfaces that introduced collaboration between API providers, key stakeholders and ultimately the consumer&mdash;leading to better, more consumable interfaces without the overhead of iterating within a production environment.  In the last year, this has grown to the point where new tools and languages have emerged, which employs markdown based formats that have the potential make the API design process friendlier to non-developer. The evolution of API design is making API design something that potentially anyone can do, which brings the process closer to the problem owners who are looking for solutions to their everyday problems.
<p><strong>API Management</strong><br /> In the web API world, management of API operations is not about governance, but about making assets more accessible, in safe and secure ways, that do protect a providers interests, but also allow for establishment of API operations that encourage integration and innovation. With modern API management tools and approaches, the process of management is more about understanding, than it is about control. API management becomes about having your finger on the pulse of consumers, understanding how they are using resources, enabling providers to identify new trends, features and enforce healthy usage of API resources&mdash;protecting everyone involved from API owners to developers, and the end-users who will be using the resulting websites and applications.
<p><strong>Importance of Evangelism</strong><br /> Every one of the successful API programs today, deploy some sort of outreach as part of their initiative, widely called developer advocacy or evangelism. This type of engagement with API consumers both offline and online is essential to building a strong base of integrations. If nobody knows about an API, and what is possible when you integrate with it, the chances that an API will get used are slim. It doesn't matter how technically sound an API implementation is, if nobody knows about it, it won&rsquo;t get used.
<p><strong>Sensible Business Models</strong><br /> APIs are allowing well established, and new business to evolve their existing business models, while also allowing them to establish entirely new ways of conducting business. External API ecosystems that flourish into R&amp;D labs, allow for potentially safe environment for incubating new business models, increasing the ways that businesses can generate revenue in 2014.
<h3>What Are APIs Delivering?</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-deliver.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>APIs open up multiple channels for distribution of resources, which is the primary reason for their increased usage. Many start-ups tout an API-first development strategy, where they focus first on developing a stack of API resources before they consider developing any web or mobile application. APIs can be platform agnostic, allowing for easily adding of new application channels, devices and other objectives without changing the API.
<p><strong>Websites</strong><br /> Allowing for the development of distributed websites around centralized data and content was the first practical use of web APIs. The modular, and distributed nature allowed for easy syndication of content for providers, and a quick source of rich content for developers and site owners. Early pioneers like Amazon and eBay realized the power of developing armies of resellers for their products and auctions, that allowed anyone to build a website around their valuable resources.
<p><strong>Mobile</strong><br /> With the introduction of iPhone from Apple, the true potential of distributed, modular API driven resources was realized. Developers were able to build apps that consumers wanted, and API driven utilities like Foursquare and Twilio provide the resources they needed, built on top of the recently realized cloud infrastructure, which was also API driven. APIs make resources accessible, but the mobile phone delivers these valuable resources right to where we need them&mdash;in our hands.
<p><strong>Tablet</strong><br /> Building on the success of using APIs to deliver mobile resources, Apple introduced us to the power of the tablet, with the introduction of the wildly successful iPad. Where earlier tablets had failed, the iPad did not&mdash;quite likely this was due to the fact that we didn't have the API driven resources necessary to satisfy customers, as well as the power of the cloud infrastructure to deliver the backend needed. APIs provided the rich content and data necessary to drive the next generation of touch and interactive apps that would emerge via the iPad and following Android and Windows tablets.
<p><strong>Data Analysis &amp; Visualization</strong><br /> With the wealth of data available via the thousands of emerging APIs, developers realized that the distributed nature of APIs allows for remote analysis of data, as well as the visualization of this information via dashboards and embeddable widgets, services and portable web applications. A new wave of &ldquo;big data&rdquo; solutions haleve emerged once a critical mass of APIs were achieved, providing a way of engaging with valuable resources beyond just web and mobile applications.
<p><strong>Internet of Things</strong><br /> As the Internet matures, the desire to connect not just mobile phones, tablets, laptops and computers to the Internet increases, but it has also spread to every object in our everyday lives. The availability of APIs has fueled a new phenomenon call the Internet of Things, which is connecting objects like the thermostat in our homes, our automobiles, and entire cities to the Internet using APIs. APIs aren&rsquo;t just for web and mobile anymore, the web API approach is being used to send and receive content from sensors, cameras, and anything you can imagine in the world around us to API backends, where data can be processed, stored and distributed anywhere online.
<h3>Emerging Trends Enabled By APIs</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-trends.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>As API usage expands rapidly into the Internet of Things, other practitioners are exploring new ways to put APIs to use in the the web and mobile applications they already use&mdash;approaches that will enhance the user experience, and increase the quality and reach of API driven resources.
<p><strong>Aggregation</strong><br /> Innovative companies across business sectors ranging from cloud computing to advertising are aggregating APIs allowing for a new breed of APis that allow access to multiple platforms, and enhance or augment existing resources via these new interfaces. Some APIs only go so far when cleaning up data, or matching with other complimentary resources available in the API space&mdash;leaving a huge opportunity for innovation by start-ups, and pushing APIs to deliver even more value to API consumers and their application end-users.
<p><strong>Interoperability &amp; Reciprocity</strong><br /> With much of our personal and business lives moving into the clouds, an a new wave of companies have emerged that allow anyone, even non-developers to migrate content and data between online platforms using APIs. This new approach to system interoperability has evolved from early IT migration processes, providing not just interoperability but reciprocity between multiple platforms, while also empowering end-users to initiate migration between platforms that meet their goals.
<p><strong>Real Time</strong><br /> APIs have helped developed a serious appetite amongst end-users for the delivery information as quickly as possible. Having data, content and other resources instantly in our hands via mobile devices, along with the introduction of new real-time technologies like Websockets and PubSubHubub, has made the web an increasingly real time, 24/7 available world. Either from real time APIs directly from providers, or the increasing number of real time frameworks, applications have become much easier to send and receive valuable API resources that occurs in real time or near real time&mdash;changing the pace of how we consume and produce information.
<h3>Remembering Why It All Works</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-ying-yang.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<p>With the increasing pace of technology and APIs, it can get easy to get caught up in the complexity of the web, and make similar mistakes to earlier API initiatives, forgetting exactly what made web APIs work in the first place. For web APIs to be sustainable there are a number core elements that API providers and consumers should keep in mind, to make sure all this success we are seeing doesn&rsquo;t fade.
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong><br /> The number one reason this whole world of web APIs has taken off is because of simplicity. In most cases web APIs do one thing, and they do it well. Using simple, intuitive URIs to interact with valuable resources. APIs should not be much harder than to load a web page, allowing anyone to be able to put APIs to use. Simplicity in design, deployment, management, monetization, and evangelism should be front and center for all API providers&mdash;without simplicity, web APIs will find themselves along the same path as its predecessor(s).
<p><strong>Easy, Low Cost Access to Resources</strong><br /> Access to resources is what attracts developers to APIs. This new wave of web APIs is putting resources into the reach of developers that once were either impossible, or so costly that innovation would never occur within small businesses and start-ups. Reducing any barriers to entry for API consumers is the hallmark of a modern web API, and even if you require registering, and keys to access APIs, providers should make ease of access a top priority for all APIs.
<p><strong>Working Together (Collaboration)</strong><br /> Simplicity, self-service and access to valuable resources beg for collaboration not just amongst developers, but also between the platform and developer ecosystems. API ecosystems open up new opportunities for collaboration, and have the potential to change culture within a company, allowing it to reach outside of the firewall and experience new ideas. As the number of APIs grow, the opportunities for collaboration between API providers increases as well, allowing for shared reach across multiple developer ecosystems, and the chance to attract developers who need multiple resources to achieve their goals.
<p><strong>Permissive Terms of Service</strong><br /> An API terms of service guide all interactions consumers will have with exposed resources. The purpose of the TOS is not just protect a company's assets from misuse, is it meant to direct consumers in ways that stimulate integration and innovation, while also protecting the interests of end-users. API TOS need to be legalese enough to cover everyone&rsquo;s ass, but also liberal enough to incentivize consumers to integrate with their own business operations.
<p><strong>Transparency In Operations</strong><br /> APIs provide an extremely huge opportunity for innovation around company assets, but it requires a company to invest in being more transparent regarding how it does business. APIs by themselves do not equal transparency, they require a company to share insight into how it operates, and what it is planning as part of the road-map. APIs let sunlight to business operations in ways that can disinfect and change company culture, allowing in the oxygen needed for new ideas to flourish. Transparency is a requirement for any successful API initiative, it is up to you regarding just how much is just right.
<p><strong>A Balanced 3 Legged  Approach</strong><br /> Inherited from the 3 legs of oAuth, a balanced approach to API operations in a way that isn&rsquo;t just centered around the providers objectives, but equally considers API consumers and end-users, is essential. While its easy to focus on the value delivered by API providers, or the innovation of developers, without educated, engaged and trusting end-users any platform will stumble. Compare the three legs of an API platform to a three legged stool, if one is missing or short, the stool will hold nothing and fall over when used.
<h3>What We Need To Do</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/kin-lane/kin-kaia.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>There are two things that I feel are critical to helping guide the API economy, and help prevent us from going down a dark alley or face failure like earlier API efforts like SOA encountered. While there are other illnesses and problems we face, I think that these two areas reflect system illnesses that could prove catastrophic to the entire space.
<p><strong>Respecting Everyone&rsquo;s Privacy</strong><br /> As technologists, developers and platform architecture we MUST respect the privacy of any users who depends on our API pipes. The content, data and other resources that flow through APIs are NOT the new oil. There are plenty of monetization opportunities around this flow of information, but we must respect everyone's privacy in the process. What flows through these API pipes may not mean anything to the platform owner, or the developer integrating with apps, but this information will be very valuable and meaningful to the end-user.
<p><strong>Stop Reinventing the Wheel</strong><br /> There are some amazing API design patterns that already exist in the API space, leaders from Salesforce to Twilio have already defined some of the best patterns that are currently imaginable for common resources like contacts, images, and messages&mdash;with all of these patterns why are we often re-inventing the wheel and designing APIs within walled silos? We need to get better at sharing API definitions, media types and underlying data models with the community. Telling stories around why they are good, how they are being used, and publicly share them in an openly licensed way, so that others can follow our lead. This is why <a href="https://3scale.net">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist have started <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, to give everyone healthy patterns that they can follow and emulate in their own API operations.
<p>Let&rsquo;s celebrate how far we've come in 14 years of web APIs, learn from the pioneers who have been around, tell stories about how we are using APIs, publishing and being proud of the work we do, while building for our collective future, and not forgetting the dark matter that holds this amazing space together.

        <span class="post-date">01 May 2014</span>
        <p><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-politics.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p>Terms of service <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/10/the-levers-dials-and-switches-for-your-participation-in-the-api-economy/">guide every aspect of how we provide and consume an APIs</a>&nbsp;that drive&nbsp;our web and mobile applications. As an excercise, lets imagine a future where API terms of service (TOS) are machine readable, and always in alignment with the multiple partner tiers, and the service composition of an API platform.
<p>Right now, the options available to API consumers is organized into service packages, allowing us multiple tiers of access, based upon usage + cost, when registering for and consuming API resources. Imagine if during this process the API TOS were integrated into the registration and account management workflows. Imagine you could fully understand each portion of the API TOS, and be provided with options, instead of a single, rigid level of service.
<p>Currently <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/17/politics-of-apis/">options for API access are throttled across TOS, privacy policy, branding, service level agreements, pricing, and service composition and partner access tiers</a>. I want to explore the possibility that these building blocks could be machine readable, allowing for variances on each aspect of API operations. This scenario would allow for API consumers to prioritize which aspects of operations are most important to them, allowing them to pay more for premium access to API services.
<p>I&rsquo;m just working through my thoughts on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/17/politics-of-apis/">politics of APIs</a>, expanding on ideas of machine readable terms of service (TOS) introduce to me by Tyler Singletary (<a href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>)&nbsp;of <a href="https://twitter.com/KloutAPI">@KloutAPI,</a> and also a tweet from Antony Falco (<a href="https://twitter.com/antonyfalco">@antonyfalco</a>)&nbsp;of <a href="http://orchestrate.io/">Orchestrate.io</a>&nbsp;about the potential to allow for variances of TOS.
<p>I would love to hear your thoughts on this subject. Am I off in left field, or is this something we should play with more?
