I will be doing a webinar with Chris Haddad ([@cobiacomm][2]) of [WSO2][1] on October 9th, where we discuss [API management best practices for digital business ecosystem][3].

WSO2 is one of my partner API server providers. I’m a big supporter of what they do because they were the first open source API service provider to emerge out of the [20 API service providers][4] in the space.

Chris and I will be exploring a couple are of specific areas, regarding the business of APIs:

  * Emerging API economy and digital business ecosystems
  * How to assemble the building blocks of a successful API
  * When a complete open source API management platform delivers business value
  * Future trends in maximizing the value of APIs

WSO2 brings a wealth of API experience to the table and I look forward to exploring these areas with Chris. The webinar titled "[WSO2 Case Study – API Management Building Blocks and Business Value][5]", will be on Tuesday, October 9, at 9:00 a.m. – 10:00 a.m. PDT.

Look forward to having you there, visit [WSO2 for more information][6].
