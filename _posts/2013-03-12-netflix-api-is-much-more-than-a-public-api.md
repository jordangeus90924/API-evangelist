{% include JB/setup %}<p>Netflix has entered the final stages of shuttering its public API last week.Its been coming for a while now, starting in June of 2012, and now is official with the platform no longer accepting new API registrations.After reading about the changes to the Netflix Public API program on their blog, and hearing much of the news in response, everyone seems to file this away, along with the Twitter API--just another API platform screwing over its developers.As I do, I wanted to take a step back, look at the bigger picture and try understand what happened.Â On October 1st 2008, Netflix launched their public API, and they appear to have done everything right.</p>
