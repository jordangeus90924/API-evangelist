{% include JB/setup %}<p>I’m currently planning a 9 city hackathon tour, starting with the CityGrid Los Angeles Hackathon, and following up with Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, NYC, Baltimore, New Orleans, and Austin.The CityGrid Hackathon tour is meant to bring together commercial and civic hackers to build the next generation of apps we use in our everyday local lives.I’m trying to find a blend of developers, business, marketing and advertising folks that will come together and develop commercially viable ideas that can also make our cities better places to live.So Im looking for sponsors that really enhance the local theme of the event, so I started with: Local API Stack - These are APIs that I track on for CityGrid, providing direct value to local mobile and web app developers.Mobile Back-end as a Service - Service providers that exclusively provide back-end platforms and tools for mobile developers.</p>
