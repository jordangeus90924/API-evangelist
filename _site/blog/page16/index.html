        <span class="post-date">13 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.practicefusion.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/practice-fusion-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the benefits of doing an API, is so that you can take advantage of the potential for a community feedback loop, driven by internal groups, external partners, and even in some cases the pubic. Under <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">my API management research, you can find a number of building blocks I recommend for helping power your feedback loop</a>, but sometimes I like to just showcase examples of this in the wild, to show how it all can work.</p>
<p>I was reading the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.practicefusion.com/blog/2016-product-vision/">Letter from our co-founder: 2016 Product vision</a>, from <a href="http://www.practicefusion.com">Electronic Health Record (EHR) provider Practice Fusion</a>, and I thought the heart of the blog post, represented a well functioning feedback loop. As Practice Fusion looked back over 2015, they noted the following activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>798&nbsp;<a href="http://knowledgebase.practicefusion.com/forums/276361-product-ideas">product ideas submitted</a>&nbsp;with over 3,000 comments.</li>
<li>64&nbsp;<a href="http://knowledgebase.practicefusion.com/forums/276361-product-ideas/status/1466105">community ideas already delivered</a>&nbsp;as product features.</li>
<li>45&nbsp;<a href="http://knowledgebase.practicefusion.com/forums/276361-product-ideas/status/1417611">new ideas currently being worked on</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Acknowledging that this feedback <em>"powers everything we do"</em>. They continue listing some of the major customer requests that were fulfilled in 2015, and close the letter with an "eye towards the future". It is a simple, but nice example of how a platform's community can drive the platform road map. Sure a lot of this comes from the SaaS side of the Practice Fusion operations, but it works in sync with the <a href="https://developer.practicefusion.com/">Practice Fusion developer community</a> as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lesson from this one, to include in my overall research, is to always have a way to collect feedback from the community, tag ideas for discussion as potential additions to the road map, and carefully track on which ideas get delivered, and which ones end up being included in the road map. This is something that is pretty easy to do with Github Issue Management, which I use for my own personal projects, to drive both my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/roadmap/">road maps</a>, and resulting <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/change-log/">change logs</a>.</p>
<p>This post also pushed me to begin tagging these types of stories, organizing them into a simple API playbook, full of API platform how-tos, like this product vision letter from co-founder of <a href="http://www.practicefusion.com/">Practice Fusion</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/slate/slate-tripit.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was just talking API documentation with&nbsp;Brent Baker (<a href="https://twitter.com/norcaljhawk">@norcaljhawk</a>), and Jordan Lampe (<a href="https://twitter.com/JsLampe">@JsLampe</a>) from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dwolla.com/">Dwolla</a>. As we were going through their API documentation, they mentioned how they were using <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">Slate</a> for the version 1.0 of their API documentation, but for this round they took what they felt were just the best parts of Slate, and were looking to craft a new experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/24/dwolla-using-slate-for-an-evolved-api-documentation-experience/">I had written about their use of Slate for API docs back in 2014</a>, so it makes sense for me to keep tracking on, but more importantly I think the move reflects the wider evolution of API documentation. If you aren't familiar with Slate, it is a very attractive way to document your APIs, that many API providers and consumers have latched on to. Slate, in contrast to the very utilitarian style of Swagger UI, has certain elements developer prefer--something I can see why, after looking at a lot of API docs.</p>
<p>Dwolla's evolution from their old static API docs to Slate, and then<a href="https://docsv2.dwolla.com/"> to their current version</a>&nbsp;highlighted two important aspects of the modern API documentation evolution for me. First, the feedback to the Dwolla team revealed that the three column format which Slate used for documentation, made the documentation seem like it was not part of the overall Dwolla experience--it was separate. Which is one unique thing Swagger UI did, is that allowed it to be embedded within any API portal, even though the look was not as attractive as Slate is.</p>
<p>As they evolve overall their portal experience, <a href="http://dwolla.org">Dwolla</a> was sure they wanted to keep the code sample viewer, which allows for inline viewing of raw, PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript samples for each API. In rethinking their API docs, the Dwolla team wanted to decouple the three-pane experience, but keep the attractiveness, flowing navigation, and inline language sample experience that Slate delivered--keeping just the best parts of the increasingly ubiquitous API documentation format.</p>
<p>For me this highlights some of the elements, the latest wave of API documentation developers, like <a href="https://any-api.com/">Any API</a>, may want to consider as they help push forward the overall API documentation conversation. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/25/we-should-be-generating-slate-from-swagger-so-we-maintain-a-machine-readable-core/">Any API did what I wanted to see, and combined the interactive functionality of Swagger UI, and the clean UI / UX that Slate brought to the table</a>. I recommend to anyone crafting the next generation of API documentation solutions, consider the overall layout, making things more decoupled, responsive, and allowing of more embeddability of all, or even just portions of the API documentation--making the API documentation experience more portable, and re-mixable.</p>
<p>Even though I'm not seeing everything I would like to when it comes to the evolution of API documentation, I am optimistic about what I am seeing, and my conversation with the Dwolla team shows me there is a lot of positive momentum forward in how leading API providers are really thinking about what matters, when it comes to API documentation.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-sad-face.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I got an email in my inbox, <a href="https://developers.elasticpath.com/labs-helix">about a new API modeling language from Elastic Path earlier today</a>. The product is called Helix, and is sold as being <em>"the first enterprise-class API modeling language designed specifically for REST Level 3"</em>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Elastic Path team is where I first learned about the concept of hypermedia, I believe back in 2011--honestly, I had heard the concept before, but never fully grasped what it was, and the potential until 2011 (I know I am slow). However it has been an awareness that has grown rapidly, the more I learn about hypermedia, study how people are practicing hypermedia, and even dabble in it myself with my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/11/applying-a-little-hypermedia-is-helping-me-tighten-down-my-api-design-and-tell-a-better-api-story/">curation</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/02/realizing-i-need-hypermedia-to-bring-my-api-lifecycle-vision-to-life/">building block APIs</a>.</p>
<p>Elastic Path is an expert in the area of hypermedia, so it makes sense they would step up with some hypermedia focused API tooling, and even a modeling language. No surprises here, but where I was a little surprised, was when I read the "Why Helix":</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Elastic Path built Helix because existing API modeling languages, such as RAML, Swagger, and API Blueprint, while good for describing standard APIs, are not well suited to designing hypermedia APIs. Elastic Path Cortex, our patented API technology, utilizes Helix definitions and a Helix-compatible implementation, allowing our partners and customers to extend existing APIs and quickly create new ones.</em></p>
<p><span>After reading, I wanted to explore the portion of their description that states, <em>"Elastic Path Cortex, our patented API technology, utilizes Helix definitions and a Helix-compatible implementation, allowing our partners and customers to extend existing APIs and quickly create new ones."</em>, but specifically the<em> "patented API technology"</em>. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=pts&amp;hl=en&amp;q=inassignee:%22Elastic+Path+Software,+Inc.%22">Something a quick Google Patent search discovers as defined five separate patents held by Elastic Path</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Hmmmmmm.....</strong></p>
<p>I know you all think I'm some hippie dippie API dude, who doesn't get all this VC driven, business shit you are all calling startups, and innovation, and you are probably right. However, I'd argue that many of all you really do not get this Internet, or API thing either. This is a hard one for me, because I've worked with Elastic Path since way back in API Evangelist history, and I personally know and love their team. So its hard for me to call bullshit on this, but I have to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not all the way through the detail of the patents, but in my opinion, they should never have been approved. They go against everything that is the Internet, and why APIs work. The only thing I see unique in the patent titles, abstracts, and art, is the term "microkernel". Not sure exactly what that is, but the rest of it sounds like what we are all already doing with APIs to me--correct me if I am wrong?</p>
<p>Luckily patents are coming back onto my radar, thanks to my lovely partner in crime doing the research for her piece,&nbsp;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2016/01/12/patents/">Ed-Tech Patents: Prior Art and Learning Theories</a>. Her work, and this release from Elastic Path is encouraging me to <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">spend some fresh time going through my patent research</a>, and make sure that I am paying attention to this type of stuff in real-time. I started my dive last January, making it a perfect time to refresh my research in the area.</p>
<p>I swear, with the Oracle v Google, last years Swagger bullshittery, and now this, y'all are going to turn API into SOA, and then everyone is gonna be whining at me that I promised this API thing would work!! Luckily someone will come along with the next thing to sell you fuckers, make money, and y'all can fuck that up too. #IFuckingQuit!</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-trusted-apps-and-users.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was emailed by someone working in government, asking some pretty interesting questions around using an application showcase, to make trusted applications available to an ecosystem of partners. I'm not going to talk specifically about the agency, as I have not gotten approval to talk publicly, but I think the question is an interesting mix of several areas I am researching, that I wanted to explore a little further, in an anonymous fashion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a a heavily edited, summarized version of what was asked, but it essentially went like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There are 400 apps that want to get data from an organization but only some portion of them meet or exceed the governance criteria to be deemed &ldquo;trustworthy&rdquo;. &nbsp;This usually involves certain legal commitments are followed and other privacy requirements are satisfied--these 400 apps that will be evaluated, and if they qualify, they will be put into the an application registry. Another aspect of it is that rather than each of the 400 apps having to go to each of the partners to get authorized and access the partners API that it would be more efficient to rely on the application registry to determine if they can expose their APIs to that apps request(s) as well.</em></p>
<p>Application showcases, that share approved applications with an ecosystem is common, but what I found interesting about this agencies question is that they want to also use the application approval process, as a sign of trust for other partners, when it comes to accessing their own API resources. As I said, this conversation spans three key areas of what I'm seeing occur modern API ecosystems:</p>
<ul>
<li>3rd Party Applications (ie. approval, showcase, case studies, etc.)</li>
<li>Partner Programs (i.e. certification, access tiers, etc.)</li>
<li>Service Composition (ie. plans, monetization, rate limiting, etc.)</li>

<p><a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">Modern approaches to API planning</a>, and well thought-out <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API driven partner programs</a>, provide the approaches you need to approve partners (ie. companies), and the applications they build. Then your service composition, <a href="http://3scale.net">using API management infrastructure 3Scale</a>, is how you craft the partner tiers of access, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/easier-to-offer-ops-apis-to-your-devs-if-your-api-service-provider-has-apis/">provide the API infrastructure APIs to your partners</a> for knowing which applications, have which levels of access. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/03/what-is-api-service-composition/">I've written about service composition many times</a>, but my <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/">partner research is just getting going</a>, so I wanted to take a&nbsp;look at the API pioneers, as potential blueprints in these areas--let's start with Amazon's approach:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/">Amazon Certification</a></strong> (individuals)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/">Amazon Partner Network</a></strong> (groups, software)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see both the individual, and group level offer several layers of certification, depending on individual, as well as the software being sold (ie. government, hardware, AWS marketplace, SaaS, etc). &nbsp;For some more examples of partner programs, I am taking a look at&nbsp;<a href="http://certification.salesforce.com/">Salesforce with their certification program</a>, the <a href="http://cgi6.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SolutionsDirectory">Ebay&rsquo;s Solutions Directory</a>, with&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/general/official-partner-program">Twitter's official Partner Program</a>, over at <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/marketingpartners">Facebook with their Marketing Partners program</a>, and the <a href="http://developer.edmunds.com/certified-dev.html">Edmunds Certified Developer Network</a>, for a start.</p>
<p>I felt this conversation provided me an interesting look on certifying partners (companies, organizations, agencies, individuals), and the software integration(s) they produce (app showcase, directory, etc.), then using that as a trust driver for your API service composition for your own platform, but also extending that identity, trust, and authentication for your partners to use in their own API service composition.</p>
<p>The application showcase portion of this story is interesting, but I think the use of partner program certification, and extending this to your partners, so that they can use in their API service is unique. Something that is totally possible, i<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/27/which-api-service-providers-across-the-20-areas-i-track-on-have-apis/">f your API management, planning, and partner layers all have APIs</a>. You can then use your infrastructure APIs, provide facades for your partners to access users, applications, partner program details, and other aspects of API operations, in a seamless way using APIs. *mind blown*</p>

<p>API Evangelist has long been dedicated to helping the average business user understand all that is API. I saw early on in 2010, the potential of APIs, when used to empower the IT, or even shadow IT of the average business user. I think I've done well in this mission, except for one thing, the API Evangelist network is heavily focused on providing APIs, and much more lighter on topics and information around consuming APIs--something I will be working hard to shift over the next five years.</p>
<p>To help me tackle this, is my new partner <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a>. I do not partner with organizations, unless they help fuel my research, and Cloud Elements is helping me pushing forward several areas including <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">API aggregation</a>, <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API reciprocity</a>, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/30/here-are-the-top-api-stacks-i-will-be-working-to-define-in-2016/">pushing me to profile 50 of the top business sectors</a>. While these areas of my research will have lots of information for API providers, many of the companies, services, and tooling I profile in these areas will be about empowering API consumers, and even more importantly--all types of API consumers, not just developers.</p>
<p>Services like IFTTT and Zapier, make APIs accessible to the average business user because they allow them to move things around in the cloud using APIs. API service providers like Cloud Elements are allowing the average user to not just move things around in a way that protects their interest, and the interest of platforms (aka reciprocity), but they also all for aggregation, automation, and orchestration, of critical business "life bits" like documents, contacts, and images. This is why I seek out partners like them, to work in concert to better understand the space, but also tell stories that help average business user solve their actual problems. #winwin</p>
<p>You will hear me talk a lot about what <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a> is doing in 2016. Partly because they give me money, yes, but also because they are giving me money to operate, and spend my time researching how APIs can be put to work by the average business, and telling more stories that focus on API consumption. <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a>, and <a href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a> have helped me push forward my API provider focused research, and I look forward to helping balance the API consumer side of the scales through my partnership with Cloud Elements.</p>

<p>I struggle a lot with how I separate out my research areas--there are a lot of reasons why I will break off, or group information in a certain way. Really it all comes down to some layer of separation in my head, or possibly what I perceive will be in my readers head. For example, I broke off <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia into its own research project</a>, but now I'm considering just weaving it into <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">my API design research</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I conduct my research the way I do, is that it lets me spin out research, if I feel necessary, but I can easily combine projects, when I want as well. As I move API <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">aggregation</a> and <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">reciprocity</a> out of my "trends" category, and into my primary bucket of research, I'm consideration an addition of a 3rd area dedicated to just orchestration. Right now I'm considering aggregation staying focused on providing APIs that bring together multiple APIs into a single interface, and reciprocity is about moving things between two API driven services--I'm thinking orchestration will be more about the bigger picture that will involve automation, scheduling, events, jobs, logging, and much more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I enjoy my research being like my APIs, and keeping them the smallest possible units as possible. When they start getting too big, I can carve off a piece into its own area. I can also easily daisy chain them together, like API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">definitions</a>, and <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia</a> are. Some companies I track on will only enable API reciprocity at the consumer level, like IFTTT, where others <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">like Cloud Elements will live in aggregation, reciprocity, and orchestration</a>. I also think orchestration will always deal with business or industrial grade API usage, where my individual users can look to some of the lighter weight, more focused solutions, available in reciprocity.</p>
<p>Who knows? I might change my tune in the future, but for now I have enough curated stories, and companies who are focused on API orchestration to warrant the spinning off of its own research. Once added, I will link offf <a href="http://apievangelist.com">the home page of API Evangelist with the other 35+ research projects into how APIs are being put to work</a>. I'm hoping that like my research into API <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">monitoring</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">testing</a>, and <a href="http://performance.apievangelist.com">performance</a> has produced a critical Venn diagram for me, that API aggregation, reciprocity, and orchestration, will better help me understand see the overlap in these areas for both API provider, and consumer.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I feel pretty strongly that for the next wave of growth in the API sector, we need the majority of public APIs in use today, to have well crafted, as complete as possible, <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions in either OpenAPI Spec or API Blueprint</a>. Yes I know, we actually need all of these APIs to be crafted using hypermedia approaches, but until then we need them all to possess machine readable API definitions, making them discoverable, learnable, and consumable.</p>
<p>It is easy to get hung up on this being about <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a>, but API definitions are enabling almost every step along the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">35 areas of the API life cycle I am mapping out</a>. Historically API definitions have bee used for interactive API documentation, but more recently are additionally being used to light up other aspects of API integration, such as setting up your <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">API monitoring</a>, loading into the <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">API client</a> of your choosing, or lighting up a mock server for use in development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition enabling services and tooling throughout the life cycle, well crafted, complete API definitions is driving <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a> literacy. Many API developers and architects learn by reverse engineering the APIs they know, and a well crafted <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/">OpenAPI Spec</a> or<a href="https://apiblueprint.org/"> API Blueprint</a> provides a detail blueprint for enabling this experience. API definitions make it easier to learn about good, and bad API design, in terms of the APIs you actually care about--equaling a much more open mind.</p>
<p>I've been working to define API definitions as part of my API Stack work, for over a year now. You can <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack">access all the APIs.json + OpenAPI Specs + API Blueprint + Postman collections under the /data folder for the project repository</a>. Additionally, this repo is one of the sources of <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io which is an APIs.json driven open source API search engine</a>, which provides an <a href="http://apis.io/apiDoc">API for you to register and search for API definitions</a>.</p>
<p>In 2015, <a href="https://github.com/APIs-guru/api-models">I saw another strong player emerge, that I'm big on supporting--APIs.guru</a>. The open source API definitions repository is looking to be the Wikipedia of API definitions, providing a single place we can find, robust, complete, API definitions in a variety of formats. They have done a lot of work to seed the repository with 196 APIs, possessing over 4000 endpoints, but they are looking to take things to the next level, and will need our help to this Wikipedia of APIs become a reality.</p>
<p>The API Stack, APIs.io, and APIs.guru all need you to help contribute, and refine the API definitions in their indexes. Developers around the world are using these definitions in their work, and modern API tooling and service providers are using them to define the value they bring to the table. To help the API sector reach the next level, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">we need you to step up and share the API definitions you have with API Stack, APIs.io, or APIs.guru</span></strong>, and if you have the time and skills, we could use your help crafting other new API definitions for popular services available today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need help getting in touch with APIs.io or APIs.guru, there is contact information on both their sites. Alternatively, feel free to just ping me with the URL of your own Github repository, and I'll make sure your API definition index gets in sync with all of this new wave of open API repositories.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-open.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Another story I wanted to tell from <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/07/i-loaded-that-csv-into-a-database-now-let-me-expose-an-api-so-i-can-get-some-help/">my work to expose an API yesterday, so I could get help with it</a>, was focused around the service composition that I used. I feel like this is a powerful story, that should be told, and retold among API evangelists, across conversations with folks who are new to the API space, and the concept of putting APIs to work in their daily business worlds.</p>
<p>The largest concern I hear from people who don't fully understand API, is the perceived loss of control, from putting things up on the open Internet. When you don't understand <a href="http://3scale.net">modern API management infrastructure</a>, and the nuance of API service composition, what an API does can seem pretty scary. The first lesson around me exposing of an API, from the <a href="https://twitter.com/APIStrat">@APIStrat</a> speaker database, was about soliciting help from <span>Nicolas Greni&eacute; (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung?lang=en">@picsoung</a><span>)</span>, and the second lesson is centered around how I used a combination of public / private endpoints to make this work.</p>
<p>The first two endpoints or methods I published from my speaker databases, were simple GETs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/">http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/aO6zItrUhKEUexi7zNiUjOzzJ1230Rfno9P123DJRHNEuh4117/">http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/aO6zItrUhKEUexi7zNiUjOzzJ1230Rfno9P123DJRHNEuh4117/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All 351 speakers in our database are already public, <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/all-events/">on the schedules for each of the six @APIStrat events</a>, so there really is no reason why I would lock up the APIs to get this information--I am just returning JSON representations, in addition to the HTML I already do on the websites.</p>
<p>However, for the collaboration part with <a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung?lang=en">@picsoung</a> the POST, PUT, DELETE (aka Add, Update, Delete), I'm going to need to secure things a little more. <a href="http://3scale.net">Using my already in place, 3Scale API management infrastructure</a>, I have an access tier specifically for my partners like 3Scale, <a href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a>, and @picsoung already has a set of API keys at this API plan level. I simply put the three endpoints / methods for POST, PUT, and DELETE for the URLs above, into my "partner" level, and they require an appID and appKey for each API call--secured.</p>
<p>This is a simple, yet powerful example of how APIs work, and specifically the level of control that API service composition gives you. I can easily make the speakers across our six conferences available in a machine readable format for use in other websites, and mobile applications. With the same API, I am also able to open up write capabilities to the partners who I trust, enabling them to help me evolve my speakers information. I am able to publicly share my resources via an API, making HTML and JSON versions of it available, while also opening up important collaboration which will move my work forward, in a safe, and secure way.</p>
<p>This is APIs in action, and how they actually give you more control over the digital resources that are fueling your daily operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-evil.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I see a lot of APIs, and honestly I'm not excited about all of them. Some are public. Some are private. I am feeling that I could put the APIs I see into 3 different buckets: valuable, some value, and no value. Obviously there is going to be much more nuance to it that that, but this post is about the APIs that generate no value.</p>
<p>First, let me clarify--I am speaking value to everyone involved. This is my own personal measurement. Examples of APIs that offer no value, are usually about the exploitation of developers and/or end-users, while giving the lion share of value to the platform. I put a lot of Internet of Things APIs into this bucket, and other leading APIs from companies like Snapchat or LinkedIn. I'd also put APIs like facial recognition technology, some machine learning APIs, and APIs that may seemingly offer a lot of value to everyone involved, because of the opportunities for abuse, any value that has generated is cancelled out.</p>
<p>I' not going to point fingers at the specific API that triggered this post. I will just say that after reviewing an API, the opportunity for abuse is pretty huge, by the platform, as well as with 3rd party developers. It reminded me that I need to work to provide more <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">ethical best practices as part of my API design research</a>, reminding API architects to step back early on in the process, and consider the big picture--asking themselves should we be doing building this API in the first place.</p>
<p>We have what it takes to do almost anything we want, but I don't think we ask ourselves: "should we be doing this" enough. We aren't look at the big picture, and considering privacy, security, surveillance, and what the overall potential for abuse might be. When I am considering the potential for API abuse, I ask myself "what would Keith Casey (<a href="https://twitter.com/CaseySoftware">@CaseySoftware</a>) be able to do?" Keith is a wicked smart friend of mine, with a unique view on the world, which, well....gives him some unique super powers for causing trouble. As I'm reviewing existing APIs, or crafting my own, I just think about what kind of trouble could Keith get into if I gave him this API.</p>
<p>I poke fun at my friend, but this post comes from a serious place, and I know he'd agree. If you are an API architect, try to consider the wider potential for abuse using yout API resources. There are many wicked smart developers out there who aren't as stand-up as Keith, and could really cause some serious damage with the resources made available via your APIs. Make sure you have modern API infrastructure, and processes in place, that will give you visibility into how everyone is putting your resources to work, and that it is alignment with your business goals.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 0px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government-regulation-uncertainty.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I pulled the title for this post directly from <a href="http://dyn.com/blog/which-way-does-your-data-flow/">understanding the impact of cross-border routing of data during an era of emerging geographic restrictions</a>, from <a href="http://dyn.com/">Dyn</a>. I'm writing about this to add it to my list of numerous concerns for API providers, when it comes to internationalizing their APIs, for the global API economy--such as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/24/successful-patterns-for-multilingual-apis-and-documentation/">establishing&nbsp;successful patterns for multi-lingual APIs and documentation</a>, or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/05/your-api-access-replicated-into-multiple-regions-around-the-globe-for-additional-charge/">providing API access that is replicated into multiple regions around the globe</a>.</p>
<p>Dyn's perspective comes from a more regulatory level, which I think coming from a DNS provider is something that makes the story even more compelling. At any rate, I feel with the big data / surveillance culture that is thriving right now, regulatory concerns, when it comes to data and privacy will continue to be a natural response, and will increase, and continue to be more heavy handed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not a fan of regulation, I understand its purpose, but historically I have not been an advocate for. However there has to be a counterbalance to the bad big data behavior from tech companies, surveillance by tech companies and the government, and the increasing cyberbullshittery that is going on. I'd prefer this counter-balance be a human and people driven response, but I'm guessing it will end up being a wave of very emotional government regulatory responses, <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018365.asp">like we seen with Safe Harbor</a>, and beyond.</p>
<p>Its my opinion that extensive logging, software defined networking, and APIs coupled with OAuth controls is how we are going to orchestrate our operations in this new, extremely volatile, land-mine ridden regulatory environment that is unfolding. This is why I keep an eye on global DNS infrastructure providers like Dyn, <a href="http://dns.apievangelist.com/">as part of my DNS research</a>, so that I can map out all of their API operations, and include alongside logging, SDN, and other relevant APIs--the automation of cross-border data flows using APIs, so that you can mitigate regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<p>I see the concept of "data flow" playing a significant role in helping use define our digital self, both individual and organizationally. Similar to <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">bringing into focus what online services I depend on,</a> and having a better handle on where my valuable digital assetts are stored, I want to know where my data flows, and have some control over it as a business or as individual. I suspect this is something that more businesses, and god help us, hopefully more individuals begin asking for, and head off some of the regulatory headwinds that are in store for all of us.</p>

<p>I have been working to clean up the the web presence for the <a href="http://apistrat.com">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference</a>. We concluded the 6th edition of <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIStrat in Austin this last november</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat">check out the videos</a>), and in addition to this events website, I have five other sites to maintain, and make sure remain accessible. The first three sites have a custom database back-end, the next two had a WordPress + MySQL back-end, and the last edition uses Jekyll + YAML as its back-end(?).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this round of housecleaning I aggregated the schedule of speakers from all six events into a single spreadsheet, which ended up on my desktop as a CSV file. As I was talking this morning with the rest of the @APIStrat team about the 2016 schedule, I shared the CSV in Slack, as I also uploaded to a MySQL database (yeah I'm new / old school like that). I was talking with my partner in crime Nicolas Greni&eacute; (<a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung?lang=en">@picsoung</a>) shortly after, and he wanted to help me push forward the list of speakers, expand the speaker and company info, as well as connect it up with sponsor info.</p>
<p>I then responded, as Steve Willmott (@njyx) points out on Twitter (is nothing private these days!!!):</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">APIer's at work <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> "I may take you up on that sir. loaded into DB. Let me expose an API on it I&rsquo;ll ping you for some help" <a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung">@picsoung</a></p>
&mdash; Steven Willmott (@njyx) <a href="https://twitter.com/njyx/status/685165771203461121">January 7, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>I went ahead and exposed an API of all of the 351 speakers who have participated in @APIStrat since <a href="http://newyork2013.apistrat.com/">the first edition in New York in February 2013</a>--you can access the endpoints, publicly at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/">http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I also added the ability to pull a single speaker as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/aO6zItrUhKEUexi7zNiUjOzzJ1230Rfno9P123DJRHNEuh4117/">http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/aO6zItrUhKEUexi7zNiUjOzzJ1230Rfno9P123DJRHNEuh4117/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All you have to do is put in the speaker_id for each of the speakers. Now, anyone can pull the information on 351 of the speakers who have helped make @APIStrat a thing. Next I also want <a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung?lang=en">@picsoung</a>&nbsp;to be able to help me build upon the list of speakers. This is where APIs rock at making the web not just consumable, but also something anyone can program.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="ttp://apistrat.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://www.3scale.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/apistrat-logo.jpg" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Using the two paths provided above, I then added a POST, PUT, and DELETE for the @APIStrat speaker resource. I want <a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung?lang=en">@picsoung</a> to help me add, update, and delete from the speaker list. Now he can help me make sure all the information available is up to date. <a href="http://3scale.net">Since I have 3Scale API infrastructure in place</a>, and since <a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung?lang=en">@picsoung</a> is established as a "partner in crime", he has an API key which allows him to not just GET (which anyone can do), he can also POST, PUT, and DELETE--making my speakers resource programmable to only myself, and @picsoung, or anyone else who has "partner in crime" level access to the @APIStrat API.</p>
<p>I know my work isn't done, but I will hand-off to @picsoung for some feedback before I go any further. Steve's tweet reminded me of the potential for APIs to empower collaboration like this. I have a CSV list of speakers across six editions of @APIStrat, which I've uploaded to a database, and I need help improving. So...I published an API providing access to the list, but then using <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale I am able to also add add, update, and delete capabilities, in a secure way</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uploading the CSV to the database, exposing a read / write API, and crafting an OpenAPI Spec for the API (below), is about all I have time for today. I will hand off to <a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung?lang=en">@picsoung</a> for feedback, and then I can spend some time thinking about whats next. We want to add more details on the companies the speakers work for, and the APIs that exist behind this diverse spectrum of speakers.</p>
<p>As APIs should be, the speakers API for @APIStrat is a work in progress. We are just going to be a little more transparent about the journey. BTW....if you want some "partner in crime" API access, let me know. ;-)</p>

<p>I came across the <a href="https://www.privacyrights.org">Privacy Rights Clearinghouse</a>, while conducting a search that turned up the chronology of data breaches, <a href="https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breach/new">which provides details on&nbsp;4,725 data breaches that have been made public since 2005</a>. The website allows you to search for data breaches by type of breach, type of organization, and the year in which it occurred--some very valuable information.</p>
<p>In 2016, as breaches continue to be common place across almost all industries, we are going to need to take the chronology of data breaches up a notch. I would like to see an API be made available for the valuable database. As I do, I write stories about what I'd like to see in the space, and forward the link to key actors, and tell the story to the public at large, in hopes of inciting something to happen.</p>
<p>Making the data breach information available via API, would encourage more storytelling around the events, which could include much more meaningful <a href="http://d3js.org/">visualizations using solutions like D3.js</a>. Information about companies, could be included into other business search and discovery tooling, and more push notification networks could be setup that could keep industry experts more informed about what is happening across the sector.</p>
<p>Now that I am on the subject, it would make sense if all the privacy topics, and other resources available via the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse accessible through a simple API interface. If you work with the&nbsp;Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, and would like to talk about making this happen, feel free to reach out. If you are someone who would like to help work on this project, or possibly fund this work, also please let me know.</p>
<p>The type of information the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacyrights.org">Privacy Rights Clearinghouse</a> is aggregating is only going to become more important in the insecure cyber world we have created, and making it accessible for reading and writing via a simple API, would significantly help the organization make a bigger impact, and educate a larger audiences.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Jan 2016</span>
        <p>I am finding all sorts of interesting examples as I push forward my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans research</a>, where I study the API planning approaches employed by over 50 of the leading APIs. One of the items, on my API plan story list, comes from <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a>, the search API, who I think has <a href="https://www.algolia.com/pricing">one of the more sophisticated API plans</a> of all of the APIs I looked at this round.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the cool aspects I found <a href="https://www.algolia.com/pricing">was a "world-wide replicator" option on the pricing page for Algolia</a>. The feature is interesting to me because of the UX / UI approach employed, as well as the concept of offering API replication to different regions as a dimension of API plans. You have to admit the separate section, as part of API pricing, is pretty forward leaning, and not something you see often.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/algolia-world-wide-replication-slider.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>What is even cooler, is that when you move the slider, increasing the number of regions the API is available in, your price per package is adjusted to include the replication. I believe they apply just a flat rate increase for each plan level, but I could see this be something that has unique cost per region (ie. US being more expensive than EU). As the debate about in-country data storage and compute evolves, I think this will become pretty significant.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/algolia-world-wide-replication-slider-2_png.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The goal for the Algolia world-wide replication, is to decrease latency for end-users, when searches are made. Providing up to five separate regions around the globe, where your API can be deployed, as part of your Algolia API plan. While not something that could be accomplished by every API, the approach is in alignment with wholesale API movements I've talked about before.</p>
<p><a href="http://3scale.net">Using API infrastructure like 3Scale offers</a>, you could establish this type of variability in plan levels, that are tailored for containerized-enabled, world-wide replication similar to what Algolia offers. <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">I have added world-wide or regional replication as one of the API plan building blocks</a>, and will keep documenting other examples of this very technical, but potential business and politically driven aspect of the API plan line of the life cycle I am working to define.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Jan 2016</span>
        <p>As I look through the business models of leading API providers I am profiling, I'm increasingly seeing security as a selling point. When API providers break down their pricing into tiers, they are usually very good at breakdown down the elements of what goes into each plan--this is what I have been studying for last couple weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I come across security leveraged as part of API plans, it is rarely a part of the free or entry levels, and is something you usually see in the higher level paid plans, and enterprise tiers. Here is an example of this, <a href="https://www.box.com/pricing/">in a screen shot from the Box pricing page</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.box.com/pricing/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/box-plans-screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>These plans are part of the SaaS side of the Box operations, but Box are pretty unique in that they have separate pricing tiers for the SaaS side of their operations, and a related, but addition set of pricing for the API side of their platforms. However, Box's approach provide the best example of this in action, with add-ons beyond the plan based pricing, that were also very security focused.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.box.com/pricing/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/box-plans-screenshot-2.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Box is a document platform that services the enterprise, which includes numerous, very heavily regulated industries. It makes sense that they are emphasizing security. My focus is that security is leveraged as specific feature of individual plans, with an emphasis on it being present in the upper tiers, and with add-ons.</p>
<p>This really isn't news. It makes sense that an emotionally charged element like security is used as a component of planning and pricing. I'm just looking to document security as a component of API planning for my research, educate other platforms about the potential for this type of use, but I am also looking to better understand how different companies, in different industries are wielding it (or not).</p>
<p>I predict that security will increasingly be used as a component like this in SaaS and API planning. In the current, very insecure online environment we all are living in, individuals and companies will pay a premium for real or perceived security. My goal is to better discovery when security is wielded like this, and try to better understand when it is a real component of API planning versus when its just used as an emotional way to convince people to upgrade to higher level plans.</p>

<p>I was profiling the Facebook API as part of <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">my API Stack work</a>. While I only use a handful of the endpoints available to me via the Facebook API, as the API Evangelist, I feel like I should have an awareness of the popular social API. Additionally, the number of great stories I find dramatically increase with the number of API profiles that I complete.</p>
<p>One story I extracted from my Facebook API research is about providing a <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.5/test-user">dedicated test user API</a>. Using the test user API you can add, manage and delete test users, which you can use throughout the developing and testing of your API integration. Facebook is user- centric, but it seems like the concept applies equally to any other valuable resource made available via APIs today.</p>
<p>I'd file this under <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">virtualization</a>, when it comes to organizing as part of my overall research. Providing virtualization options for API consumers is something that is only going to grow with the Internet of Things, and privacy concerns. API providers should be looking at how they virtualize entire APIs using modern approaches to containerization, so they can be used in dev, qa, and production environments, but they should also be looking at providing data and content virtualization solutions like Facebook does with a <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.5/test-user">test user API</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/cli/">Amazon has a new blog dedicated to just their Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>. I use AWS as anchor for many of my API stories, but I also acknowledge that many API providers will never be at the scale of AWS, but nonetheless I am drawn to the regular streams of lessons available via the cloud platform, if you look in the cracks.</p>
<p>The new AWS CLI blog is one of these. I do not think all API providers should run out and start a separate blog for their CLI, but the existence of a dedicated CLI blog at AWS shows the significance of CLI to the API world. If you are looking to court the enterprise, and many other developer groups, a CLI should be a very relevant tool in your toolbox. If a platform interface is not also available via a CLI, you might be missing an entire segment of the developer community.</p>
<p>Like with my <a href="http://ide.apievangelist.com/">IDE</a>, and <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">SDK</a> research, I may be firing up a separate area for CLI. I regularly curated CLI focused conversation, services, and tooling during my monitoring, making it a good candidate for isolation into its own research project. Part of the reason in isolating into its own research, is that the topic will get regular attention from me, and a single repo for storing my research, which means the chances my understanding around the topic will increase greatly.</p>

<p><a href="https://octopart.com">Octopart is a search engine for electronic parts</a>. They have been on my API monitoring radar for some time now, because they have a <a href="https://octopart.com/api/home">very well done API</a>. Octopart was one of the first API providers I wrote about, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/31/giving-excel-power-users-the-api-driven-resources-they-need/">who were making their data available via their API, available in spreadsheets for business users, via a plugin</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reasons I am writing about Octopart this time, is much more mundane. They are just doing it right, and I wish all product websites, had an API presence like Octopart does. As soon as you land on the home page of the site, where you can search for electronics products, all you have to do is scroll down, and you immediately see a link for the API. There is also a prominent set of links in the footer, labeled products, that focus on the API, as well as the Excel and Google spreadsheet connectors built on top of it.</p>
<p>Octopart has a well designed API, that clearly plays a significant role in their overall existence as an online electronic parts company. Every time I read one of their blog post, or end up in their developer area looking at something, I can't help but think about how ALL product companies should be following Octopart's lead. It all takes me back to the year 2000, where I was working hard to convince companies of the importance of having a website, as I now work to convince companies of the importance of having an API. #dejavu</p>

<p>It is a new year, and we have a lot of work to do when it comes to defining APIs in the new year.

<p>In 2016, a name as been given to the specification--<a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a>. If you know me, you know how I feel on all of this, but in 2016, I am focusing on whats next, not what just happened, so I am just happy there is a name, not some intermediary WTF.

<p>If you are planning on doing anything cool with the OpenAPI Spec, please reach out and let me know. Now that we have forward motion with the specification, and a name we can ALL use, I will be assembling a new toolbox dedicated to the spec, and all the cool things y'all are doing with it. As I look forward across the 2016 API horizon, I have no doubt that the OpenAPI Spec will be essential to the next wave of growth in the API sector.</p>

<p>A road map for your API, is one of those essential building blocks that can go a long way in building trust with your API consumers. Sharing your plans, helps developers prepare for the future, and better plan for their own road maps, keeping everything potentially in sync.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my vantage point, a simple, up to date, easily found road map is a building block that benefits both API provider and consumer. Road maps help provider organize their plans, and figure out how they are going to communicate it with the ecosystem, then setting the overall tone for how API consumers will engaging with a platform--both good and bad.</p>
<p>During my regular monitoring of the space, I saw that Microsoft released a pretty slick "<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/roadmap/">Cloud Platform Roadmap</a>", which is yet another sign for me on how Microsoft is stepping up their cloud (API) game. Their interactive road map allows you browse the roadmap by areas like cloud infrastructure or Internet of Things (IoT), and see features that are&nbsp;recently available, public preview, in development, cancelled, or have been archived.</p>
<p>Beyond the core functionality of the road map, <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/server-cloud/archive/2015/01/30/increasing-visibility-for-our-customers-announcing-the-cloud-platform-roadmap-site.aspx">I'm impressed that they published a blog post telling why they did it, acknowledging that it will bring visibility into platform operations</a>. Additionally there is a prominent button, providing an email address where you can send your suggestions for the road map, providing evidence of how a roadmap can contribute to the overall feedback loop for an API platform.</p>
<p>Overall, I like the simplicity of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/roadmap/">Microsoft cloud platform road map</a>, and it is definitely a healthy building block I'd encourage other API providers to consider offering as well. I'm going to make sure Microsoft's roadmap is one of the examples I cite <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">along the API management line</a>, as part of my overall API life cycle map.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/16/defining-api-monitoring-apis-so-i-can-map-to-each-stop-along-the-api-life-cycle/">Last week I was playing with&nbsp;defining API monitoring APIs so I can map to each stop along the API life cycle</a>. I took three of the API monitoring services I use (APIMetrics, API Science, and Runscope), and like I do for other areas along the API life cycle, and for common API stacks, I profiled their APIs using the OpenAPI Spec. This is standard operating procedure for any of my research areas, in that part of profiling each company's operations, I profile the API surface area in detail.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/">For each of my research projects</a>, I will include this listing of each API endpoint available as part of the work. As I was adding one for my API monitoring research, I had a thought--I wanted to reorganize the endpoints, across the three API monitoring service providers, and group them by tag. So I started playing with a new way to look at the APIs available in any given APIs.json driven collection.</p>
<p>This is a listing of API resources available in&nbsp;<a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/apis.json">this projects APIs.json</a>, organized by tag.</p>

<p>If you mouse over each actual endpoint, it will tell you the host of the API it is for. I am just playing around. I have no idea what value this would present for anyone, except for just helping provide a new dimension for viewing the APIs involved. For me, this particular one helps me understand API resources across many providers, while also encouraging me to think more critically about how I tag the APIs I define using OpenAPI Spec.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/apisjson/bycollection.html">view the listing by provider</a>, as well as <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/apisjson/bytag.html">listing by tag</a>, for my <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com">API monitoring research</a>. I will be adding these two views to all of my core research areas, and the API stacks I define as I have time, but I thought it would be interesting to add to my own API stack, which is probably the most defined of all of my stacks--here is <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/apisjson/bycollection.html">listing by provider</a>, and <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/apisjson/bytag.html">listing by tag</a>, for <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">my API Evangelist stack</a>.</p>
<p>We'll see how this plays out as I roll out for more of my research. I am sure I will learn a lot along the way, by adding new APIs.json driven dimensions like these. I'd like to eventually have a whole toolbox of these types of views, and even some APIs.json and OpenAPI Spec driven visualizations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-diff.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>As the number of API definitions increases out there, I'm coming across many duplicates of APIs I already have in my collection(s). In 2016, I will increasingly need to be able to execute a diff on two <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a> or <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> files, and get back a programmatic, as well as a visual reference, which allows me to quickly understand the differences between each spec in detail.</p>
<p>In support of this API definition diff tooling, I can also see the potential for some sort of merging tooling, that would allow me to easily say yes or no, and merge various elements of either API definitions. I recently got sucked into using Ancestry.com, and they provide a nice way to merge discovered documents into your family tree, accepting or rejecting what you want--I would like to see this exist for API definitions.</p>
<p>As with every other other of the almost 1000 building blocks available across my API research, each element of the API life cycle should be available as an API, as well as lightweight, open source, micro tool. An API definition diff and merge would make to very viable API services, and if someone doesn't get around to building, I will probably get to work on a version of it for my own needs. I have a growing queue of API definitions I need to merge with my master stack, and not all of it is as straightforward as "accept all".&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/04/api-definition-origin-validation-and-attribution/">adding attribution</a> to my <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API definition research</a>, I'm adding diff and merge as building blocks. They'll provide a reminder for me (and anyone else), that attribution, diff, and merging at the API definition level is an important aspect of the API life cycle.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-attribution.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have done a lot of work hand crafting, and often scrape crafting, <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">machine readable OpenAPI Spec</a>, as part of the work on the <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a>. Creating a usable API definition is a lot of work, making it is a pretty valuable commodity, in contrast to my strong opinion that they should be readily available for EVERY API today. While there is still a HUGE AMOUNT of work to be done, I feel like the ball is beginning to move forward, when it comes to the number of publicly available API definitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the API economy to work at the scale we all have pictured in our head, the surface area of ALL APIs, and its supporting operations needs to be defined, and available to consumers and service providers. Every API should have an <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a>, <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections">Postman Collection</a> available for consumers to put to work. As we close 2015, I'm happy to say that I am optimistic about the amount of work others across the space are putting into API definitions, like the folks over at <a href="https://github.com/APIs-guru">API Guru</a>--who are discovering, improving upon, and validating API definitions in a variety of formats, <a href="https://github.com/APIs-guru/api-models#existing-integrations">all available on Github</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of work goes into crafting these definitions, and it is good to see them investing in this area. Their valuable index of almost 200 API definitions is being used to power <a href="https://any-api.com/">Any API</a>, and is complete with&nbsp;<a href="https://any-api.com/">a JSON index for the API collection</a>. Keep an eye on it, as it is growing every day--I know that I will be closely watching every commit to the open API definition repository. As I look through their collection, there are many APIs I already have, but there are many others I would love to build upon the work done by API Guru--just as I encourage others to do with my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack work</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this forces me to consider, as this new <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition layer of the API economy</a> evolves, and we are all borrowing, reusing, and building upon the work of others, where does API design attribution come in? In a post Oracle v Google API copyright case world, where APIs are copyrightable, how do we start moving forward with a healthier vision of defining and sharing of API designs, challenging the dystopian future handed to us by Oracle and our the federal courts. API design attribution is how we do this, where we give credit the sources of valuable API definitions.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/APIs-guru/api-models">While browsing the machine readable index for the APIs Guru collection</a>, I noticed that they had an x-origin collection avaiable for each API they define. Within this object, they describe the format, url, and version for the OpenAPI Spec file in the index is available, much like I do with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json indexes of APIs</a>. I have provided references to "swagger-original", as part of some of my APIs.json indexes, but many of them were hand crafted so there was no source, with only the static documentation acting as the source.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The approach by API Guru got me expanding on my own thoughts on this, where I want to site the potential source for any API definition in my collections, However in this fast growing API definition driven world, I am also looking to potentially cite multiple sources for any one API definition I have in my collection(s). If an API definition has an authoratative source, I want to have the URL indexed. If an API definitions has been enhanced or augmented through the work of others, I want to have those URLs indexed. In short, I need to attribute multiple sources, not just the origin as APIs Guru does.</p>
<p>I may vacuum up 5-10 separate OpenAPI Specs for any given API I have, looking for any details that I do not have with any of my own API definitions--each of these sources, if they contribute, append, or augment X amount to my API definitions, they should be cited. I just don't think there should be one authoritative source for any API definitions, in a world where sometimes API consumers better describe the APIs they depend on, than the API owners do. I want to attribute one, or many sources for any API definition I craft.</p>
<p>This process doesn't stop with existing APIs, I should also be able to attribute the API designs of others. If I borrow from the design of Twilio and SendGrid API designs (which I should without legal concerns), for my own custom messaging APIs, I should be able to attribute them for my inspiration in my API definitions. API design will be much like music, in that we will be building on each others riffs and beats, and we should pay respect where it makes sense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will play with a potential an object schema for my API attribution vision. Building on what APIs Guru is doing with their x-origin. First, I will turn it into a collection so I can reference multiple sources, then I will also go beyond just origin, and I'll call my object x-attribution, and add a property for determining what type of attribution it is. For now, I will add attribution as a building block for <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com">my API definitions research</a>, which will be something I will be rapidly expanding on into its own category, and maybe get to crafting an actual schema soon.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-definitions-gears.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Z (<a href="https://twitter.com/zdne">@zdne</a>) over at Apiary <a href="http://blog.apiary.io/2015/12/17/API-Blueprint-Future/">published a pretty interesting blog post before christmas</a>&nbsp;which highlights two important elements of profiling APIs using popular API definition formats. Z is key to the vision behind <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, one of the top 3 <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition formats</a>, that are fueling API design in 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Giving The Body Some Love</strong><br />One common complaint I've seen on forums, issue threads, and other places API developers hang out, is that OpenAPI Spec does not allow for properly describing the request body payload. I definitely agree with this, but is something that doesn't often impact me, as the type of APIs I am currently deploying, rarely employ a very complex body payload. However I do know some APIs that I've documented, where if you can't properly define the body, the API appears to have no value whatsoever, when described using an&nbsp;OpenAPI Spec.</p>
<p>It was good to hear Z state that, <em>"In 2015, we have spent most of the year building only one feature--the description of body parameters. This feature is also know as the MSON syntax."</em></p>
<p><strong>Acknowledging Media Types</strong><br />The next significant area Apiary is addressing with API Blueprint and MSON, is when it comes to supporting multiple media types, and making sure they are properly described in the API definition--<a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/mson">MSON</a> FTW!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Z talks about how, <em>"MSON isn't another syntax for JSON. MSON is agnostic to serialization media types. With MSON, I can describe the data and defer the decision whether they will be send as JSON, XML or HAL over the wire."</em></p>
<p>I will be learning more&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/mson">MSON</a>&nbsp;in January, and reacquainting myself with API Blueprint, as I document my APIs stack(s), but also specifically two of my APIs that provide JSON, HTML, and Siren media types. Hopefully this will allow me to also document the growing number of hypermedia APIs available across the space.<em><br /></em></p>
<p>Media types, and body are two areas that OpenAPI Spec (aka Swagger) is deficient. Something that gives Apiary a pretty interesting head start when it comes to two pretty fundamental building blocks of the web, and therefore APIs. I was going to start using vendor extensions, to begin playing around with content-type negotiation in my OpenAPI Spec&nbsp;files, but I might just invest my energy into sharpening my API Blueprint skills, and definition repository instead.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/01/03/thinking-about-the-monetization-layer-for-public-data/">Thinking About The Monetization Layer For Public Data</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">03 Jan 2016</span>
        <p>This is my walk-through of the concepts involved with the monetization of public data using APIs. In this work I am not advocating that companies should be mindlessly profiting from publicly available data, my intent is to provide a framework for organizations to think through the process of generating revenue from commercial access to public data, acknowledging that it costs money to aggregate, serve up, and keep data up to date and usable for the greater public good--if public data is not accessible, accurate, and up to date it is of no use to anyone.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/07/a-better-understanding-of-government-apis-and-their-consumers-before-considering-charging-for-use/">I have long argued that companies and even government agencies should be able to charge for commercial access to public&nbsp;data</a> and be able to generate revenue to cover operational costs, and even produce much-needed funds that can be applied to the road map. My work in this has been referenced in existing projects,&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/24/setting-a-precedent-when-charging-for-high-volume-access-to-government-apis/">such as the Department of Interior and Forest Service looking to generate revenue from commercial access and usage of public data generated&nbsp;by&nbsp;the national parks systems</a>. In my opinion, this conversation around generating revenue from publicly available digital assets should be occurring right alongside the existing conversations that already are going on around publicly available physical assets.</p>
<p><strong>Building Upon The Monetization Strategies Of Leading Cloud Providers</strong><br />My thoughts around generating revenue from public open data is built upon monitoring the strategies of leading online platforms like Amazon Web Services, Google, and others. In 2001 a new approach to providing access to digital resources began to emerge from Internet companies like Amazon and Salesforce, and by 2016, it has become a common way for companies to do business online, providing metered, secure access to valuable corporate and end-users data, content, and other algorithmic resources. This research looks to combine these practices into a single guide that public data stewards can consider as they look to fund their important work.</p>
<p>Do not get me wrong, there are many practices of leading tech providers that I am not looking to replicate when it comes to providing access to public data, let alone generating revenue. Much of the illness in the tech space right now is due to the usage of APIs, it is due to a lack of creative approaches to monetizing digital assets like data and content, and terms of service that do not protect the interest of users. My vantage point is the result of six years studying the technology, business, and politics of the API sector, while also working actively on open data projects within city, state, and federal government--I'm looking to strike a balance between these two worlds.</p>
<p><strong>Using Common Government Services As A Target For Generating Much-Needed Revenue</strong><br />For this research, I am going to use a common example of public data, public services. I am focusing in this area specifically to help develop a strategy for&nbsp;<a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral</a>&nbsp;but it is also a potential model that I can see working beyond just public services. I am looking to leverage&nbsp;<a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">my existing Open Referral work</a>&nbsp;to help push this concept forward, but at the same time, I am hoping it will also&nbsp;provide&nbsp;me with some public data examples that are familiar to all of my readers, giving me with some relevant ways to explain some potentially abstract concepts like APIs to the average folk we need to convince.</p>
<p>For the sake of this discussion things down and focus on three areas of public data, which could be put to work in any city across the country:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organizations</strong>&nbsp;- The business listings and details for public and private sector agencies, businesses, organizations, and institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Locations</strong>&nbsp;- The details of specific locations which organizations are providing access to public services.</li>
<li><strong>Services</strong>&nbsp;- The listings and details of public services offered at the municipal, county, state, or federal levels of government.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral is a common definition for describing public services organizations, locations, and services, allowing the government, organizations, institutions, and companies to share data in a common way,</a> which focuses on helping&nbsp;them better serve their&nbsp;constituents--this is what public data is all about, right? The trick is getting all players at the table to speak a common language, one that serves their constituents, and allows them to also make money.</p>
<p>While some open data people may snicker at me suggesting that revenue should be generated on top of open data describing public services, the reality is that this is already occurring--there are numerous companies in this space. The big difference is it is currently being done within silos, locked up in databases, and only accessible to those with the privileges and the technical expertise required. I am looking to bring the data, and the monetization out of the shadows, and expand on it in a transparent way that benefits everybody involved.</p>
<p><strong>Using APIs To Make Public Data More Accessible and Usable In A Collaborative Way</strong><br />Publicly available data plays a central role in driving websites, mobile applications, and system to system integrations, but&nbsp;simply&nbsp;making this data available for download only serves a small portion of these needs, and often does so in a very disconnected way, establishing data silos where data is duplicated, and the accuracy of data is often in question. Web APIs are increasingly being used to make data not just available for downloading, but also allow it to be updated, and deleted in a secure way, by trusted parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this example I am looking provide three separate API paths, which will give access to our public services data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>http://example.com/organizations/ -&nbsp;</strong>Returns JSON or XML listing and details of organizations for use in other applications.</li>
<li><strong>http://example.com/locations/ -</strong>&nbsp;Returns JSON or XML listing and details of organizational locations&nbsp;for use in other applications.</li>
<li><strong>http://example.com/services/ -</strong>&nbsp;Returns JSON or XML listing and details of public services&nbsp;for use in other applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>A website provides HTML information for humans, and web APIs provides machine readable representations of the same data, making it open for use&nbsp;in a single website, but also potentially multiple websites, mobile applications, visualizations, and other important use cases. The mandate for public data should ensure it isn't available on a single website&nbsp;but is as many scenarios that empower end-users as is possible. This is what APIs excel at, but is also something that takes resources to do properly, making the case for generating revenue to properly fund the operations of APIs in the service of the public good.</p>
<p><strong>The Business of Public Data Using Modern Approaches to API Management</strong><br />One of the common misconceptions of public web APIs is that they are open to anyone with access to the Internet, with no restrictions. This might be the case for some APIs, but increasingly government agency, organizations, and institutions are making public data available securely using common API management practices defined by the Internet pioneers like Salesforce, Amazon, and Google over the last decade.</p>
<p>API management practices provide some important layers on top of public data resources, allowing for a greater understanding and control over how data is accessed and put to use. I want to provide an overview of how this works&nbsp;before I dive into the details of this approach by outlining some&nbsp;of the tenets of an API management layer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Users</strong>&nbsp;- Requiring users to register, establishing a unique account for associated all API and public data activity.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>&nbsp;- Requiring users to define the application (the web, mobile, visualization, etc.) and other viable information regarding their access to the public data.</li>
<li><strong>Keys</strong>&nbsp;- Issuing of unique API keys for each application, requiring their inclusion in all consumption of public data via the API.</li>
<li><strong>Service Composition&nbsp;</strong>- Placement of public data resource (organizations, locations, services) into tiers, defining which APIs different users have access to&nbsp;and the scope of that access.
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource Specific -&nbsp;</strong>Allowing access to specific data resources to a select audience.</li>
<li><strong>Read / Write&nbsp;</strong>- Restricting write access to select users and applications.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Data Specific -</strong>&nbsp;Limiting which data is returned, filtering based&nbsp;on&nbsp;who is requesting it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limits&nbsp;</strong>- All APIs are rate limited, allowing for different levels of access to public data resources, which can be defined in alignment with the costs associated with operations.</li>
<li><strong>Logging</strong>&nbsp;- Each API call is logged, with required user application keys, as well as details of the request and response associated with each API call.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong>&nbsp;- The presence of a variety of visual layers that establish an awareness of who is accessing public data APIs, what they are accessing, and details on how and where it is being applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>These seven areas provide some very flexible variables which can be applied to the technical, business, and politics of providing access to public data using the Internet. Before you can access the organizations, locations, and service information via this example public services API you will need to be a registered user, with an approved application, possessing valid API keys. Each call to the API will contain these keys, identifying which tier of access an application is operating within, which API paths are available, the rate limits in existence, and logging of everything you consume and add so it can be included as part of any operational analytics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This layer enables more control over public data assets, while also ensuring data is available and accessible. When done thoughtfully, this can open up entirely new approaches to monetization of commercial usage by allowing for increased rate limits, performance, and service level agreements, which can be used to help fund the public data's mandate to be accessible by the public, researchers, and auditors.</p>
<p><strong>Providing The Required Level Of Control Over Public Data Access</strong><br />Understandably, there concerns when it comes to publishing data on the Internet. Unless you have experience working with modern approaches to delivering APIs it can be easy to focus on losing control over your data when publishing on the web--when in reality data stewards of public data can gain more control over their data when using APIs over just publishing for a complete download. There are some distinct ways that API providers are leveraging modern API management practices to evolve greater levels of control over who accesses data, and how it is put to use.</p>
<p>I wanted to highlight what can be brought to the table by employing APIs in service of public data, to help anyone make the argument for why providing machine readable data via APIs is just as important as having a website in 2016:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness</strong>&nbsp;- Requiring all data to be accessed via APIs which required keys to be used for&nbsp;<span>ALL</span>&nbsp;applications, combined with a comprehensive logging strategy, brings a new level of awareness regarding which data is accessed, and how it is being used, or not used.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>&nbsp;- While API keys&nbsp;are primarily used for logging and analytics, it also ensures that all public data resources are secured, providing tiered levels of access to 3rd parties based upon trust, contributing value to the data, and overall platform involvement--allowing data to be securely made available on the open web.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Control -</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;APIs act as central gatekeeper regarding how data is updated, evolved, and deleted, allowing for a centralized, yet also potentially distributed, and collaborative approach to ensuring public data is accurate, possessing a high level of quality control.</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Service -&nbsp;</strong>All API usage is governed by the legal terms of service laid out as part of platform operations, requiring all users to respect and follow terms of service if they expect to maintain their public data API keys.</li>
<li><strong>Governance</strong>&nbsp;- Opening up the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the public data which may include oversight from governing body or council, a defined set of procedures, and a plan to execute those procedures.</li>
<li><strong>Provenance</strong>&nbsp;- Enabling visibility into the origins, history, and oversight of public data, helping establish the chain of custody regarding shared use of valuable data across platform operations.</li>
<li><strong>Observability</strong>&nbsp;- Allowing for the observability of data resources, and its contributors and consumers using existing platform outputs and mechanisms, enabling high levels of awareness through the API management framework employed as part of platform operations, meeting service level agreements, and expected availability.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to discuss, and quantify this control layer of any public data being made available via&nbsp;APIs if we are going to talk about monetization. Having APIs is not enough to ensure platform success, and sometimes too strict of control can suffocate consumption and contribution, but a lack of some control elements can also have a similar effect, encouraging the type of consumption and contribution that might not benefit a platform's success. A balanced approach to control, with a sensible approach to management and&nbsp;monetization, has helped API pioneers like Amazon achieve new levels of innovation, and domination using APIs--some of this way of thinking can be applied to public data by other organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Enabling and Ensuring Access To Public Data For Everyone It Touches</strong><br />Providing access to data through a variety of channels for commercial and non-commercial purposes is what modern API management infrastructure is all about. Shortly after possessing a website became normal operating procedure for companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies, web APIs began to emerge to power networks of distributed websites, embeddable widgets, and then mobile applications for many different service providers. APIs can provide access to public data, while modern API management practices ensure that access is balanced and in alignment with platform objectives--resulting in the desired level of control discussed above.</p>
<p>There are a number of areas of access that can be opened up by employing APIs in the service of public data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal</strong>&nbsp;- APIs can be used by all internal efforts, powering websites, mobile applications, and other systems. The awareness, logging, and other benefits can just as easily be applied to internal groups, helping understand how resources are used (or not used) across internal groups.</li>
<li><strong>Partner -&nbsp;</strong>After internal access to data resources, access levels can be crafted to support partner tiers of access, which might include access to special APIs, read and write capabilities, and relaxing of rate limits. These levels often include service level agreements, additional support options, as well as other benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Public</strong>&nbsp;- Data can be made publicly available using the web, while also maintaining the quality and security of the data, keep the access as frictionless as possible, while ensuring things stay up and running, and of expected quality and availability.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy -</strong>&nbsp;Even with publicly available data there is a lot to consider when it comes to the privacy of organizations, locations, and services involved, but also the logging, and tracking associated with platform operations.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>&nbsp;- One important characteristic of API platform is transparency in the API management layer, being public with the access tiers, resources available, and how a platform operates--without necessary transparency, consumers can become distrustful of the data.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing -&nbsp;</strong>Ideally all data and all schema in this scenario would be licensed as CC0, putting them into the public domain, but if there are license considerations, these requirements can be included along with each API response, as well as in platform documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Platform Meta API -</strong>&nbsp;APIs do not just provide access to the public data, they also provide access to the API management layer for the public data. Modern API management allows for API access to the platform in the several important ways:<br /> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Users</strong>&nbsp;- Providing API access to user's data and usage.</li>
<li><strong>Apps</strong>&nbsp;- Providing API access to applicaiton level data and usage.</li>
<li><strong>Tiers</strong>&nbsp;- Providing API access to platform tiers and details.</li>
<li><strong>Logs</strong>&nbsp;- Providing API access to the platform log files.</li>
<li><strong>Billing</strong>&nbsp;- Providing API access to the platform billing for access.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong>&nbsp;- Providing API access to the analytics derived from logs, billing, and usage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Observability</strong>&nbsp;- An API management layer on top of public data makes data access observable, allowing platform operators, government agencies, and potentially 3rd party and independent auditors--observability will define both the control as well as access to vital public data resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a world that is increasingly defined by data, access to quality data is important&nbsp;and easy, secure access via the Internet is part of the DNA of public data in this world. API management provides a coherent way to define access to public data, adhering to the mandate that the data is accessible, while also striking a balance to ensure the quality, reliability, and completeness of the public data.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of promises made in the past about what open or public data can do by default&nbsp;when in reality opening up data is not a silver bullet for public services, and there is a lot more involved in successfully operating a sustained public data operation. APIs help ensure data resources are made available publicly, while also opening up some new revenue generation opportunities, helping ensure access is sustainable and continues to provide value--hopefully find a balance between public good and any sensible commercial aspirations that may exist.</p>
<p><strong>APIs Open Up Many Potential Applications That Support the Mission</strong><br />As doing business on the web became commonplace&nbsp;in the early 21st century, Amazon was realizing that they could enable the sales of their books and other products on the websites of their affiliate partners by using APIs. In 2016 there are many additional applications being developed on top of APIs, with delivering public data to multiple&nbsp;web sites being just the beginning.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web</strong>&nbsp;- It is common for websites to pull from a database. Increasingly APIs are being used to drive not just a single website, but networks, and distributed websites that draw data and content from a variety of sources.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong>&nbsp;- APIs are used to make data and content available across a variety of mobile applications, on different platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong>&nbsp;- Delivering data to buttons, badges, bookmarklets, and widgets that can be embedded across a variety of websites, and applications.</li>
<li><strong>Conversational</strong>&nbsp;- Using data in conversational interfaces like for bots, messaging, and voice-enabled applications.</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations</strong>&nbsp;- Including data in visualizations, showing API consumption, and platform usage around public data.</li>
<li><strong>iPaaS / ETL -</strong>&nbsp;Enabling the migration of public data to and from other external 3rd party platforms using traditional ETL, or more modern iPaaS solutions powered via the API.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong>&nbsp;- Notifying external systems of relevant events (location or service update) by pushing to URLs via what is called a webhook.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheets -</strong>&nbsp;Publishing of data to Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheet using the public data APIs, as well as spreadsheet APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just an overview of the number of ways in which a single, or multiple APIs can be used to deliver public data to many different endpoints, all in service of a single mission. When you consider this in support of public services, a bigger picture of how APIs and public data can be used to better serve the population--the first step always involved standardized, well-planned set of APIs being made available.</p>
<p><strong>The Monetization Requirements Around Public Data API Operations</strong><br />This is where we get to the&nbsp;portion of this discussion that is specifically about monetization of the operations around publishing and maintaining high-quality sources of public data. Before a sensible monetization strategy can be laid out, we need to be able to quantify what it costs to operate the platform&nbsp;and generate the expected value from everyone at the table.</p>
<p>What are the&nbsp;<span>hard costs that should be considered</span>&nbsp;when operating a public data platform and looking to establish some reasonable monetization objectives?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Acquisition</strong>&nbsp;- What one-time, and recurring costs are associated with acquiring data. This might include ongoing payouts to API contributors who are adding, updating, and validating data via the API.
<ul>
<li><strong>Discover&nbsp;</strong>- What was spent to discover data, and identify its use on the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Negotiate</strong>&nbsp;- What time to I have in actually getting access to something.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing&nbsp;</strong>- Are there licensing costs or fees involved in the acquisition&nbsp;of data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Development</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;What one-time, and recurring costs are associated with platform development.
<ul>
<li><strong>Normalization</strong>&nbsp;- What does it take me to&nbsp;clean up, and normalize a&nbsp;data set, or across content. This is usually the&nbsp;busy janitorial work necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong>&nbsp;- What is involved with validating that data is accurate correct, providing sources, and following up on references.</li>
<li><strong>Database</strong>&nbsp;- How much work is being put putting into setting up the database, maintaining, backing up, and delivering optimal levels of performance.</li>
<li><strong>Server</strong>&nbsp;- Defining the amount of work put into setting up, and configuring the server(s) to operate an API, including where it goes in the overall operations plan.</li>
<li><strong>Coding</strong>&nbsp;- How much work goes into actually coding an API. Ideally, open source frameworks are employed to reduce overhead, maintenance, and the resources needed to launch new endpoints.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Operational</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;What one-time, and recurring costs are associated with platform development.
<ul>
<li><strong>Compute</strong>&nbsp;- What costs are associated with providing server&nbsp;compute&nbsp;capacity to process and deliver public data via APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong>&nbsp;-What costs are associated with on the disk storage, for both the database and other images, video, and related objects.</li>
<li><strong>Network</strong>&nbsp;- How much bandwidth in / out is an API using to get the job done, as well as any other network overhead.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>&nbsp;- What percentage of API management resources is dedicated to the API. A flat percentage of API management overhead until usage history exists.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong>&nbsp;- What percentage of the API monitoring, testing, and performance service budget is dedicated to this API. How large is the&nbsp;surface area for monitoring?</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>&nbsp;- What does it cost to secure a single API, as part of the larger overall operations? Does internal resource spend time, or is this a 3rd party service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Understand The Value Being Generated By Public Data</strong><br />Now that we understand some of our hard costs, let's have an honest conversation about&nbsp;<span>what value is being generated</span>? First, public data has to offer value, or why are we doing all this hard work? Second, nobody is going to pay for anything if it doesn't offer any value. Let's stop for a moment and think about why we are doing all of this in the first place, and what value is worthy of carving off to drive&nbsp;monetization&nbsp;efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct Value Generation -</strong>&nbsp;What direct value is being generated by the public data platform operations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Usage</strong>&nbsp;- How is usage wielded as part of value generation? Is value about the increased usage of a resource, or possible value generated by a minimum usage of a resource? Usage is an important dimension of determining how value is generated as part of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong>&nbsp;- How is the value&nbsp;generated on a per user level?&nbsp;Are&nbsp;more users valuable? or&nbsp;possibly&nbsp;more targeted users? Teams, groups, and many other ways to determine how users impact positively or negatively the value generated from platform usage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong>&nbsp;- How can relationships between users, or companies be applied to value generated? Will access to more relationships positively or negatively impact how value is generated for the platform and consumers?</li>
<li><strong>Data Acquisition&nbsp;</strong>- Is the acquisition of data part of the generation of value via the public data platform, encouraging the growth of data.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>&nbsp;- Is value generated looked at on a per application basis? Does having multiple applications impact the value generate? Coming up with interesting ways to understand how applications impact platform value for everyone.</li>
<li><strong>Integrations</strong>&nbsp;- What external integrations are available? How can these be leveraged to enhance the value for consumers? Are some integrations part of base operations, where others are accessible at higher levels, or on a one-off basis.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;- Is access to support something that impacts the value being generated? Does access to support resources introduce the optimal levels of value consumers are looking for? How is support wielded within overall platform&nbsp;monetization?</li>
<li>Service Level Agreements - Are we measuring the number of contracts signed, and partner agreements in place? And how we are delivering against those agreements?</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong>&nbsp;- What revenue opportunities for the ecosystem around an API and its operation, sharing in the money made from platform operations. Obviously, anything beyond operating costs should be applied to expansion of efforts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Indirect Value -&nbsp;</strong>What are some of the indirect value being generated by the public data platform operations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Marketing Vehicle</strong>&nbsp;- Having an API is cool these days, and some APIs are worth just having because of the PR value, and discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Generation</strong>&nbsp;- The API exists solely for distributing links to&nbsp;the web&nbsp;and mobile applications, driving traffic to specific properties - is this tracked as part of other analytics?</li>
<li><strong>Brand Awareness</strong>&nbsp;- Applying a brand strategy, and using the API to incentivize publishers to extend the reach of the brand and ultimately the platform - can we quantify this?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>&nbsp;- How can analytics be leveraged as part of API value generation? Are analytics part of the base of operations, or are they an added value incentive for consumers, and platform operators.</li>
<li><strong>Competitiveness</strong>&nbsp;- Is the public data effort more agile, flexible, and competitive because it has an API and can deliver on new&nbsp;integrations, partnerships, and to new platforms easier, and more cost effectively?</li>
<li><strong>Public Service -</strong> Making data available for use on many different web, mobile, and other applications demonstrates a commitment to public service, and the good public data can do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While there may be other hard costs associated, as well as areas of value being generated, this should provide a simple checklist that any open data provider can use as a starting blueprint. Additional costs can be included on in these existing&nbsp;areas&nbsp;or added on as new areas as deemed relevant--this is just about getting the monetization conversation going.</p>
<p>There are two main objectives in this exercise: 1) understanding the hard costs and value associated with operations 2) assembling into a coherent list so that we can explain to others as part of transparency efforts. When it comes to the business of public data, it is more than just generating revenue, it is about being upfront and honest about why we are doing this, and how it is done--mitigating the political risk involved with doing business with public resources out in the open.</p>
<p><strong>Putting Together A Working Plan Involving Public Data</strong><br />With an understanding of the hard costs of providing a public data platform&nbsp;and an awareness of the intended value to be generated via operations, we can now look at what details would be involved in a plan for executing this monetization strategy. API management practices are architected for metering, measuring, and limiting access to data, content, and algorithmic resources in service of a coherent, transparent public data monetization strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a core framework of API management that can be applied to public data that can be used to drive monetization efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access</strong>&nbsp;- What are the default access levels for public data access via the API.
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Service -</strong>&nbsp;Public access to the platform via user registration, or 3rd party authentication like Twitter, Facebook, or Github.</li>
<li><strong>Approval</strong>&nbsp;- Access level(s) that require the&nbsp;approval of user or application before they are able to access platform resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tiers -</strong>&nbsp;What are the multiple tiers of access&nbsp;to&nbsp;all data resources available via API.
<ul>
<li><strong>Public</strong>&nbsp;- Define the default public access for the platform, with a free, limited access tier that is obtainable via a self-service registration without approval.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contributor&nbsp;</strong>- Providing a tier of access to contribute content, validate and management data on the platform.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service Provider&nbsp;</strong>- Providing a tier of access for service providers involved with public data operations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal</strong>&nbsp;- Access tier for internal groups, used by all websites, mobile applications, and system integrations.</li>
<li><strong>Partner</strong>&nbsp;- Tier(s) of access design for data, and other partners involved in the management&nbsp;of public data resources.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial</strong>&nbsp;- Access tier(s) for commercial usage of public data resources with higher levels of access for set fees.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Commercial</strong>&nbsp;- Access tier(s) for non-commercial usage of public data resources with specific access waving fees.</li>
<li><strong>Government</strong>&nbsp;- A set of API resources is available specifically for government access.</li>
<li><strong>Auditor</strong>&nbsp;- Access across APIs specifically designed for external 3rd party auditors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Elements</strong>&nbsp;- What are the core elements that make up the service composition for the monetization plan(s).
<ul>
<li><strong>Paths</strong>&nbsp;- Establishing plans based upon the availability and access to different API endpoints,&nbsp;<span>including platform meta API</span>.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Read / Write -&nbsp;</strong>Restricting read and write access to public data to specific tiers, limiting who writes data to only trusted applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Time Frames&nbsp;</strong>- What are the timeframes that&nbsp;impact&nbsp;the public data / API monetization plan(s) and consumption.
<ul>
<li><strong>Daily</strong>&nbsp;- What are the details for managing, guiding, and restricting plan entries each day.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly</strong>&nbsp;- What are the details for managing, guiding, and restricting plan entries in weekly timeframes.</li>
<li><strong>Monthly</strong>&nbsp;- What are the details for managing, guiding, and restricting plan entries on a monthly basis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Metrics</strong>&nbsp;- What is being measured to quantify value generated, providing a framework to understand monetization possibilities.
<ul>
<li><strong>API Calls -&nbsp;</strong>Each call to the API is measured, providing the cornerstone of monetizing access and contribution to public data--remember not all calls will cost, some will add value with contributions.</li>
<li><strong>URL Clicks -</strong>&nbsp;Each click on a URL served up via the API drive data and content is measured, providing details on value delivered to internal and external websites--URL shortener required for this.</li>
<li><strong>Searches -&nbsp;</strong>All searches conducted via the API are measured, providing details on what users are looking for.</li>
<li><strong>Users -</strong>&nbsp;Measure user acquisitions and history to keep track of the value of each platform user.</li>
<li><strong>Applications -</strong>&nbsp;Measure the number of applications added, with details of activity to understand value generated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Limits</strong>&nbsp;- What are the limitations imposed across all tiers of access as part of the API monetization plan.
<ul>
<li><strong>API Calls -</strong>&nbsp;How many API calls any single application can make during a&nbsp;specific time frame.</li>
<li><strong>IP Address -</strong> Which IP addresses you can request data from, limiting the scope of serving data.</li>
<li><strong>Spend -&nbsp;</strong>How much any user can spend during a given time period, for each user or application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong>&nbsp;- What prices are set for different aspects of the monetizing the platform.
<ul>
<li><strong>Tiers</strong>&nbsp;- What are the base prices established for each tier of API access.</li>
<li><strong>Unit</strong>&nbsp;- What are the default unit prices of per API call access for each tier.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;- What charges are in place for receiving support for platform applications.</li>
<li><strong>SLA</strong>&nbsp;- What costs are associated with delivering specific quality or levels of service and availability?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the moving parts of a public data monetization strategy. It allows any public data resources to be made available on the web, enabling self-service access to data 24/7. However, it does it in a way that requires accountability by ALL consumers, whether they are internal, partner, or the public at large. This API management scaffolding allows for the frictionless access to public data resources by the users and applications that are identified as worthwhile, and imposing limits, and fees for higher volume and commercial levels of access.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Speaking To A Wide Audience With This Public Data Monetization Research</strong><br />I purposely wrote this document to speak to as wide as possible audience as possible. In my experience working with public data across numerous different industries, there can be a wide variety of actors involved in the public data stewardship pipeline. My objective is to get more public data accessible via web APIs, and generating revenue to help fund this is one of my biggest concerns. I am not looking to incentivize people in making unwarranted profits on top of public data, this is already going on. My goal is open up the silos of public data out there right now, make them more accessible, while opening up the opportunity for delivering to a variety of applications, while also funding this important process.</p>
<p>I wanted to help anyone reading this to craft a coherent argument for generating much-needed revenue from public data, whether they are trying to convince a government agency, non-profit organization, institution, or a commercial company. Public data needs to be available in a machine-readable way for use in a variety of applications in 2016--something that takes resources and collaboration. APIs are not another vendor solution, they are the next step in the evolution of the web, where we don't just make data available for humans by publishing as HTML--we need the raw data available for use in many different applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My new partner in API crime <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a> is helping motivate me to spend more cycles in 2016 on defining specific stacks of APIs, as part of my ongoing API industry research. I am taking the approach I've honed over the last five years in <a href="http://apievangelist.com">my core research</a>, and continuing to push forward on specific areas of the API industry.</p>
<p>Cloud Elements calls their aggregated APIs -- Hubs, because they are working to aggregate them into actual usable APIs. My approach is meant to organize common API definitions, into specific groups. I do not go as far as aggregating APIs into a single API, and providing a platform, and tooling for you to actually work with the APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://cloud-elements.com/hubs/">Cloud Elements currently has 11 business API hubs defined</a>, where I'm looking to push the space forward by defining 50 stacks:</p>

<p>I am not in the business of pushing the overall number of APIs forward in the API space--this number means nothing to me in 2016. I am looking to better define what the most valuable APIs are, in some of the most meaningful areas of the Internet. Some of the areas I chose because they are core to web and mobile application development, others because they are important areas to the overall economy and society, with others just because they are frick'n cool!</p>
<p>You can see my earlier work in this area, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">present under the verticals section on the home page of API Evangelist</a>, with my early look at the <a href="http://payments.apievangelist.com/">payment API space</a>, and more recent <a href="http://email.apievangelist.com/">email</a>, <a href="http://sms.apievangelist.com/">SMS</a>, and <a href="http://mms.apievangelist.com/">MMS</a> research projects. I will step up the process, and apply it to these 50 research areas, establishing research projects, profiling the companies who are active, curated the news and tooling from across the space, while looking to get a handle on some of the common building blocks employed. As always my research will be openly available in near real time on each research project site, but there will be some resulting guides, and blueprints which I hold back to monetize--maybe partners like Cloud Elements, and others will help co-brand them, and make available for free.</p>
<p>I wanted to thank Cloud Elements for helping light this fire. We are still working out details of which areas they are interested in helping invest in, but their approach to hubs, and their general support of what I do via a sponsorship, has got this ball rolling. I have cleared my calendar, to ensure I have time to tackle this work in the first quarter of 2016. If there are other areas you'd like to see prioritized, let me know, I'm happy to bump up specific areas listed above, or add new items if they make sense.</p>

<p>There is not another team API team that so focused on API literacy, with as much expertise, as the API Academy team. If you have been to any of the leading API events like <a href="http://apistrat.com">APIStrat</a>, <a href="http://www.apidays.io/">APIDays</a>, <a href="http://www.apicraft.org/">API Craft</a>, and <a href="http://restfest.net/">RESTFEst</a>, you've seen their team in action, and known what they are bringing to the table.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>) is making sure we are all on the correct path.</li>
<li>Ronnie Mitra (<a href="https://twitter.com/mitraman">@mitraman</a>) is pushing the concept of API design forward.</li>
<li>Matt McLarty (<a href="https://twitter.com/MattMcLartyBC">@MattMcLartyBC</a>) with the big enterprise API architecture picture.</li>
<li>Irakli Nadareishvili (<a href="https://twitter.com/inadarei">@inadarei</a>) is paying attention to the overall API vision.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have learned a great deal of what I know about API design and architecture from these individuals, during my tenure as the API Evangelist. When it comes to the business or politics of APIs I'm on solid ground, but when it comes to API design, and API architectural considerations at scale--I will always defer to the API Academy.</p>
<p>The team informed me, that they are looking for someone to join their team. Someone worthy. Which is no small task. I can barely count on two hands, the number of people who I would recommend for the position, sadly many are already happily working on existing projects. Good thing there are many folks I do not know as well across the space, who are API leaders--if you are one of these people, and thrive on teaching others about API design and architecture, I suggest you ping Matt McLarty over at the API Academy...they need your help!</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Dec 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-work-in-progress.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">I am stopping and collecting some of my thoughts, as I work through my API stack.</a> I'm thinking about the more difficult aspects of defining APIs, this time it is for the APIs I depend on to operate my own company. I am working to define the APIs I depend on from over 30 companies, partly to help me better understand the APIs I use, but also partly as theater here for API Evangelist.</p>
<p>To profile APIs, I use OADF and APIs.json as my machine readable definition formats. Not all APIs are created equal, so it takes different approaches to crafting their OADF, from doing it by hand for the easier ones, to scrape scripts that take consistent (static) documentation, and generate an OADF version. As I do this work, here is where the hard work is (will be) in all of this.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surface</strong> - Finding and documenting the surface area (endpoints + headers + parameters + security). There is just no way to automate this, you only know what you know.</li>
<li><strong>Response</strong> - Documenting the response, and schema using Charles Proxy. The first version of my API definitions rarely have the response modeled, as I depend on Charles Proxy plus a custom API I developed for generating JSON schema from HAR files.</li>
<li><strong>APIs.json </strong>- Bring together with an APIs.json index, which is fairly automated for me from my central API monitoring system, publishing a single, machine readable index of all the APIs available, as well as the wider API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> - As I complete around 30 of these, I realize that I will need some sort of machine readable, APIs.json driven menu, which puts a list of APIs in a certain order, and maps responses, to following request parameters, so I can daisy chain APis together for more automated tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Updates</strong> - Like knowing the surface area of an API, we only know what we know, and as Rumsfeld says, there are also the known unknowns, as well as the unknown unknowns. I see updates of API definitions, that are done externally being a constantly evolving process, which will never be perfect.</li>
</ul>
<p>The more APIs I define, the easier some of this gets. However, there will be areas that are going to always require the trained eye of an API expert, comparing definitions to live documentation, and keeping an ear to the ground for any updates. Ideally all of this work gets done by API providers themselves, but until all the benefits are evident, it just isn't going to happen. I am sure there will always be some API providers who never see the value of properly defining the valuable APIs they operate, but my mission is to reduce those numbers</p>
<p>Once I am in API definition mode, I find it hard to do anything else--it just takes over a dedicated portion of my brain, requiring an intense focus. Luckily there is also a certain amount of satisfaction, when you have a "complete" API definition for a popular API. When you see what is possible, once an API is properly defined, the quest to achieve a proper definition can become a little addictive. While i do enjoy doing this, there are simply too many APIs for one person to do, and I will need the help of other passionate API consumers, as well as providers to get the job done properly.</p>

<p><a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">As I conclude the first phase of profiling the APIs that I depend on</a>, I am thinking about my API usage at scale, and some new questions are arising, that I wasn't thinking about before. I find my API consumption, and API integration thinking historically has been on an individual API basis, which something that I hope to evolve upon in 2016.</p>
<p>Here are a handful of questions that have arose in my notebook, as I worked to profile these APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where do I login / register for a service?</li>
<li>What are the security definitions?</li>
<li>Where do I get support?</li>
<li>Where do I get updates?</li>
<li>How do I manage my keys / tokens?</li>
<li>What are the details of applications I have created?</li>
<li>What are my rate limits? Plan levels available to me?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Where am I at with my rate limits? Overall consumption?</li>
<li>What am I spending across my API usage?</li>
<li>Do I have plan B for any of these? Even possible?</li>
<li>What SDKs do I depend on for integration?</li>
<li>What are my code, content, and data licensing concerns?</li>
<li>Am I adhering to branding requirements appropriately?</li>
<li>Can I increase my API usage? Are there new fetaures I am not using?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the questions that I wrote down, as I profiled the surface area of each of my APIs. <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">I'm just creating OADF, API Blueprint, and Postman Collections, that allow me understand each endpoint, and the parameters across this almost 35 APIs I use</a>. The next phase of my work involves profiling the security and data definitions for these APIs--a process which I'm sure will surface even more questions.</p>
<p>I am not confident I will be able to answer all of these questions in the near future. Many API providers just do not make it easy for me, resulting in the addition of another manual process, which in a world of limited resources means it probably won't get done. Even with the added work, I still want to ask these questions, and spend time thinking about my API usage at scale, in preparation for a future where I am depending on not just 3-5, or 30-50 APIs, but 300-500 public APIs to get business done.</p>

I tend to not subscribe to the concept of predictions, and instead focus on what change I personally would like make within the API space, and this strategy is key to me achieving this vision.</p>
<p class="p2">First, let's start with what do I do? I track on the world of APIs, with eye towards how we can better execute on the tech, business, and politics of APIs, based upon a better understanding of approaches established by existing API providers, and the features being offered by service providers who target the space.</p>

<p class="p2">Originally I saw these research projects as just various lines along the API life cycle or journey, but increasingly I'm also seeing these as just the "first" stack of API resources that I study. Meaning, in 2016 these aspects of the API journey are themselves increasingly API driven--API deployment, management, monitoring, and many other areas are being automated via APIs.</p>
<p class="p2">Over the last five years, I've conducted my research by studying the approach of successful API providers like Amazon, SalesForce, Google, Twitter, and the longer tale of lesser known government, university, and utility APIs available today. Along the way, these APIs have started organizing themselves into logical groups for me, some based upon the industry they operate in, while others are more about specific business or developmental goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">I call these groupings "stacks"--they also go by other names like hubs, industries, categories, but one important aspect of stacks for me, is the ability to mix and match to meet various objectives, as if the APIs were legos. Some of these objectives are more individual or consumer-focused, with others being more commercial or industrial, giving me as much flexibility as I can in assembling meaningful stacks of useful API driven resources for any possibility.</p>
<p class="p1">With my core API life cycle and journey research coming into focus so nicely in 2015, I am also working to do the same with other API stacks in 2016--here are the main areas I'm focusing on out of the gate:</p>
<ul>
<li>social</li>
<li>messaging</li>
<li>users</li>
<li>storage</li>
<li>compute</li>
<li>documents</li>
<li>commerce</li>
<li>payments</li>
<li>photos</li>
<li>videos</li>
<li>music</li>
<li>audio</li>
<li>voice</li>
<li>search</li>
<li>content</li>
<li>language</li>
<li>news</li>
<li>travel</li>
<li>mapping</li>
<li>places</li>
<li>businesses</li>
<li>links</li>
<li>events</li>
<li>weather</li>
<li>movies</li>
<li>advertising</li>
<li>accounting</li>
<li>shipping</li>
<li>government (city)</li>
<li>government (state)</li>
<li><a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">government (fed)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://home.apievangelist.com">home</a></li>
<li><a href="http://automobile.apievangelist.com">auto</a></li>
<li>wearables</li>
<li>energy</li>
<li>space</li>
<li>healthcare</li>
<li>environment</li>
<li>education</li>
<li>libraries</li>
<li><a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">university</a> (faculty)</li>
<li>university (student)</li>
<li>sharing economy</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The how and why I craft each stack varies. Many of these stacks I consider to be the essential aspects of the modern Internet experience, like compute and storage, or photos and videos, while others are more business sector focused like energy, healthcare, and education.</p>
<p class="p1">As I dive into a stack, the chances of it expanding and evolving increases significantly. You can see this with my&nbsp;<a href="http://email.apievangelist.com/">email</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://sms.apievangelist.com/">SMS</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://mms.apievangelist.com/">MMS</a>&nbsp;research, or with my&nbsp;<a href="http://financial-news.apievangelist.com/">financial news</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://news.apievangelist.com/">news</a>&nbsp;research. While I try to capture any individual area, the chances it will spawn entirely new research areas, or share affinity with other existing areas are pretty great.</p>
<p class="p2">Ok, so what actually happens in all this "research", "monitoring", and what not? The value from the exhaust...I move things forward using several working models:</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Analyst Model -</strong>&nbsp;Generation of&nbsp;short form (blog posts), a project area (on Github Pages), and industry guides (HTML &amp; PDF) in each area of research. You can see this in action for the 35 lines (stacks) for the API lifecycle, and the handful of topical stacks I've done in messaging, news, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Companies -</strong>&nbsp;What companies are involved?</li>
<li><strong>Individuals -&nbsp;</strong>When relevant, what individuals are involved?</li>
<li><strong>APIs&nbsp;</strong>- What APIs exist in an area, complete with OADF + API Blueprint + Postman + APIs.json.</li>
<li><strong>Building Blocks -</strong>&nbsp;Common elements derived from features, and API resources.</li>
<li><strong>Tooling</strong>&nbsp;- What open source tooling is available beyond services.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities</strong>&nbsp;- Where are the gaps in what is being done vs. what is needed?</li>
</ul>
<p>While the majority of my research is publicly available, and openly licensed, in some sectors I will keep guides, and building blocks private, essentially available behind a paywall. All my partners are welcome to co-brand any of my public guides, and I am actively looking for sponsors of specific areas of research when it comes to doing initial research, to cobranding content and putting behind lead gen.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Strategy Model -&nbsp;</strong>Individual and industry level guides for others to follow, when planning and crafting their own strategies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building Blocks -&nbsp;</strong>Individual building block examples for companies, such as rate limits for AWS EC2, or SendGrid email.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Operational Bluprints -</strong>&nbsp;Blueprints for API operations, example would be cloud computing, SMS provider, video provider.</li>
<li><strong>APIs (Definitions) -</strong>&nbsp;OADF, and APIs.json collections that provide a machine readable blueprint for use in strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Journeys -</strong>&nbsp;Walk though of series of analysis and building blocks, in specific areas, with specific outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like the exhaust from my analyst model, some of my strategy work will be publicly available, and openly licensed, but this is the area where i will keep a little more information behind a paywall, requiring some action, or money to access my hard work and expertise.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>APIs in Infrastructure Stack -</strong>&nbsp;Design, development, and management of focused API that deliver value somewhere along the API life cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retail&nbsp;</strong>- Design, development, and management of APIs that deliver on specific stops along the API life cycle, made available as self-service resource.</li>
<li><strong>Wholesale&nbsp;&nbsp;-</strong>&nbsp;Design, development, and management of APIs that deliver on specific stops along the API life cycle, made available as on-premise resource.</li>
<li><strong>Journey -</strong>&nbsp;APIs in support of strategy journeys, allowing users to build strategy, and revisit and evolve strategy, using custom designed APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">This is a new area for me in 2016, but will allow me to better serve gaps that I identify in the overall API life cycle. I will not be launching APIs to compete with regular API providers in the space, and keeping my work focused on APIs that deliver API infrastructure resources.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Tooling for Infrastructure Stack -</strong>&nbsp;Design, develop, and operate JavaScript tooling, that runs as micro-apps on Github pages, running locally and / or using API infrastructure I've deployed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single Page Apps -</strong>&nbsp;Develop, operate, and evolve simple JavaScript apps that support the API life cycle, using my Github Pages model for deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Monetization -</strong>&nbsp;I will be playing with different models of access ranging from open, free, to paid, and advertising support options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Development of these types of applications for revenue, like API design, deployment, and management will be new for my operations, and an area where I will also focus on applications that support the API life cycle. Like APIs, all apps will do one thing, and do it well, with a very modular approach to operations.</p>
<p>The analyst portion of my operations is 100% based upon my own work, and is something I will not be scaling, relying on my own process, APIs, and tooling to scale. However when it comes to publishing of guides, strategy blueprints, and API and tooling deployment, I will be aligning myself with specific partners across the space. These partners will bring proven value to specific areas of the API life cycle I am working to bring to life in my research, analysis, and content, API, and tool creation.</p>
<p>As always, the more I do, the more I learn, and the more this plan will evolve--this post is just meant to be a guide that will help me get started in 2016.</p>

        <p>The existence, membership, and activity around local API Meetup groups is one of the overall health indicators in the API space. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/20/definition-of-api-craft/">I've long been a proponent of local API meetups</a>, helping jumpstart the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/18/api-craft-san-francisco/">early API Craft gatherings</a>, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/05/13/my-talk-tomorrow-night-at-the-dallasforth-worth-api-professionals-meetup/">helping new Meetup groups get off the ground</a>.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@APIStrat</a>, we use these numbers to help us decide where to put API conferences on, as on the ground support is crucial to making the event a success. I also consider the activity around these local Meetups a sign of how well the space is doing when it comes to outreach and evangelism across the entire industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I missed an API Meetup in your community, please let me know. If you'd like to start an API Meetup in your community, also please reach out, as I may be able to help you jumpstart your efforts with speakers, sponsors, and attendeess. However, ultimately you will have to do all the hard work of finding venues, and getting the word out locally, which if you do right, can be a very rewarding journey in my opinion.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/12/23/a-little-hack-to-help-me-better-define-method-based-apis-using-oadf/">A Little Hack To Help Me Better Define Method Based APIs Using OADF</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">23 Dec 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-technology-of-apis.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>A handful of the most iconic APIs out there, which I also happen to depend on for my own operations, are some of the more frustratingly designed APIs I know. There are many API design offenses we all commit, but one of the most frustrating for me is when you use a single URL, and depend on a single parameter, for accessing everything an API has to offer.</p>
<p>A couple of my favorite APIs, Flickr and Amazon EC2 both employ this approach. A single URL, and a single parameter for working with a wealth of API driven resources. This is a classic mistake of the technologist, delivering what you need, but making it difficult to actually learn about an API. This approach to API design delivers upon the functionality desired, but makes very difficult to document using common approaches available to us like OADF, and API Blueprint.</p>
<p>When it comes to Amazon EC2, and Flickr, there is so much more value to be articulated in the API design by itself. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr organizes their API methods by grouping them on the main page for the API</a>, and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/OperationList-query.html">Amazon just groups each method for Amazon EC2 on their documentation page</a>--something <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html">you can get in a single list if you like</a>, if you prefer. It doesn't' take much work to expose the richness available within these APIs, but when documenting using OADF, it can be hard to articulate the value brought to the table by each resource.</p>
<p>Amazon and Flickr both rely on all API calls utilizing GET, but rely on a query parameter to define each unique API call. When you document using OADF, this ends up being a single API endpoint, with a parameter, and any number of parameters to pull out the value an API offers. I needed to define each endpoint as /?method=XXXX, while still allowing each underlying parameter to be defined as a collection for each endpoint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that each parameter gets appended, using another ?, resulting in /?method=XXXX?variable1=XXXX. This design flaw, just appends the next variable to my method, messing with the whole mojo of the API call. To hack it, all I did was add a sort of shock absorber set of variables to each method call, with the first parameter working in concert.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/method=XXXX&amp;k=1?l=1&amp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In both AWS and Flickr scenarios, k, and l variables are just concatenated and absorbed, and every variable that follows is processed as you'd except. I chose the two variables for two reasons, one they are letters in the middle of the alphabet (reducing chance they will be used), and also the fact that they are my initials. It is a stupid little hack, but it seems to work (so far), for the APIs I am looking to define.</p>
<p><a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">This little hack has helped me to better document AWS EC2 and RDS, as well as Flickr</a>. I know of some other APIs out there, that I've neglected documenting because of this design flaw. Now that I have a little hack, I can better design using this little hack, and hopefully represent a little more of the value that exists within--which is the gateway to a heightened API awareness in my opinion.</p>

<p>I'm down in the detail of how we craft our API plans, looking at the approaches of almost 100 different providers, and <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/playing-with-a-json-representation-for-the-plans-for-many-of-the-leading-apis/">working to establish a common schema for cataloging the plans of these popular APIs</a>. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/dialing-in-your-api-pricing-down-to-the-endpoint-and-verb-level/">I have already talked about dialing in your API pricing down to the endpoint and level,</a> but was something I wanted to take a little bit further.</p>
<p>In my previous story, I talked about how mature API providers charge different rates for POST, and PUT requests, than they did for GET requests. Using this scenario, what if we wanted to incentivize and reward behavior through variable rate pricing at the HTTP verb level, to give developers more ownership over an API, including better access and pricing structures the more they contribute.</p>
<p>Lets use a standard business directory like say Crunchbase as a model. Everyone wants this data, and you only get so many GET requests, based upon the rate limits limits they've set. What if I was given access to more GET requests, based upon the number of POST and PUT requests I made? Meaning the more data I had added, and updated, the more access I was given when pulling data. Something I think could incentivize developers to be more involved, and improve on the overall quality of content or data via an API.</p>
<p>Of course, there would be ways people could game this, but I'm pretty sure you could identify the bad actors using modern API management approaches. You would also need other checks and balances, and quality control elements to make this a reality, but I wanted to focus on the service composition aspect. Could you incentivize internal, partner, or even public API developers to take more ownership of a resource, and help make it better, by applying variable rate controls at the GET level, that are influenced by controls at the POST, and PUT levels?</p>
<p>Something to think about. It is also something I will keep an eye out for more, as I'm making my way the portals, documentation, and pricing pages of APIs that I review. It doesn't seem like something that would take much work. I know this would be possible with my 3Scale API infrastructure, which allows me to configure pricing on a plan, as well as customized individual basis. It would not take much to adjust this rate based upon rate limits met, exceeded for specific API calls, or <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">other influencing metric I decided</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2015</span>

<p>There are more <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/companies.html">HTTP client tools</a> out there than I can shake a stick at (I've reached that point, I'm shaking sticks at things), and in 2016 I predict there will be even more entrants into the space. <a href="http://apis.how/gwbjyujag1">I'd say Postman was a pioneering force in the evolution of the HTTP client when it comes for web API space</a>, but is <a href="http://apis.how/ohgw3uqjt0">something that it is beginning to collide with API design tooling from Apiary</a>, as well as being <a href="http://apis.how/syulwzictt">morphed by new players like Stoplight.io</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe I am playing with more of these environments than the average API consumer is, because of what I do for a living, but I have to say, I am getting tired of "importing" my API definitions. Don't me wrong. I am stoked that all tools support the importing of <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">machine readable API definitions like OADF, and API Blueprint</a>, but I cannot help&nbsp;always looking to what should be next, and I want to be able to just run each API, in my HTTP client of my choice.</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/">For all of my own APIs, I provide a Postman icon, and link to a Postman Collection</a>. It just gives you quick access to the machine readable currency that all services I depend on speak, OADF, API Blueprint, and Postman Collection. However, I still have to import it into Postman, or other HTTP API client, or service I will be using. While this is a good start, and is something I recommend other API providers do, I think we can still do better.</p>
<p>If you are operating one of the HTTP API clients, or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/04/api-client-tool-garage-hub-playground-studio-workbench-and-builders/">planning one of the next generation&nbsp;API cleints, tools, garage, hub, playground, studio, workbench, or builder</a>, can you please provide a "run in XXXX" embeddable button please? I would like to see pretty little icons throughout API portals, and the service providers we depend on across the API space, that empower me run any API via the client I depend on every day.</p>
<p>Think the Twitter and Facebook share buttons, but for API integration, and the currency is OADF and API Blueprint definitions. I appreciate all you HTTP API client providers considering my crazy requests. If done right, I think it could result in some potential new users, depending how you'd handle the process for users who clicked, but didn't actually have an account with your platform yet--anyway, food for thought. #onward</p>

<p>I am continuing to build on the subway map exploration work, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">that I talked about at @Defrag and @APIStrat last month</a>, and have a more static version of my API life cycle explorer ready, which I'm simply calling the API journey. <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/journey/index.html">I have only rolled this out for my API plans research</a>, but so far I'm happy with the results, something that shouldn't be too difficult to light up for <a href="http://apievangelist.com">the other 30+ areas I'm researching</a>.</p>
<p>There is quite of bit of research that goes into the work that I publish, and the subway analogy is allowing me to share more it, making more parts of it more accessible, in ways I was never able to before. Currently you can take the journey through each of the stops along the API plans portion of my research, and learn about in details about some of the common patterns I'm seeing across the space.</p>
<p>For each stop I provide a title, and description for the stop, but if I have related organizations, tools, links, and even specific APIs or questions to ask at this stop in the life cycle for any API. My goal is to take the building blocks from leading API platforms, and the features offered by companies offering services to the space, and make accessible to anyone who wants to learn for their own operations.</p>
<p>The narrative for my API plans journey isn't 100% there, and some of the stops are lacking in description, as well as related organizations, tools, and other links. However it gives me an excellent framework to further flush out my research, while also sharing it with my readers, in a potentially interactive way. Eventually I'd like for you to be able to actually select the pieces that are important to you, and save it as a customized list at the end--soon!</p>
<p>For now, it is helping me flush out the narrative around my research, and connect the dots a little more, when it comes to relationships within. All of this will contribute to the overall subway experience I am playing with. Soon, I want will be connecting up different stops, with the other related stops on other lines within the life cycle. If I talk about virtualization in my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans research</a>, it should link to the related area, or stop on the <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">API virtualization research</a> line--soon!</p>
<p>Anyways. I will fire up the journeys for each of <a href="http://apievangelist.com">the other 30 research areas over the next couple days</a>. Then I will work to make sure the narratives are a little more coherent, and show as much of the research behind as I can, at each stop along the way. Oh, another thing. Right now I have a complete journey, I am playing with an essential version, as well as dimensions that focus on the technical, business, or political stops along the life cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am curious to see what this looks like when applied tomy other areas of research, like API management, or maybe API design.</p>

<p>I am going through each of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">35+ areas of the APi space that I monitor</a>, working to bring alive <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/playing-with-different-subway-journey-experiences-for-my-api-life-cycle-explorer/">the over 900 stops along the API life cycle</a>, that I have&nbsp;identified through my research. I'm still working through prototypes for my life cycle explorer, but <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/journey/beta/">the current version has organizations, tools, links, and questions, along with the title and description of each stop of the life cycle journey I am trying to bring into focus</a>.</p>
<p>Part of my approach in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">identifying the different lines, areas, and stops along this life cycle</a> involves taking a look at the approach of leading API providers, as well as service being offered by companies selling their solutions to these API providers--giving me two sides of the API life cycle coin. In the last couple months I have also found another way to identify potential building blocks, and round off the ones I have, through the API definitions of leading API providers.</p>
<p>All I do, is craft an OADF file for each of the API service providers I track on, within each area of my research. I'm spending time tonight working on my <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">API monitoring research</a>, so I look at three of the service providers I track on, who have APIs. The OADF specs are not complete, but provide me a baseline definition for the surface area of each API, something I'll round out with more use. Here are the endpoints I have from each provider so far.</p>

<p>When you compare the definitions for these API service providers, you are comparing apples to oranges, even though they exist in the same layer of the API space. To me, having them defined, will allow me to slowly weave them into <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">my master list of common building blocks for API monitoring</a>.</p>
<p>What really excites me, is that for each potential stop along the API monitoring line, I might be able to actually link to specific API endpoints, and even down to the verb level. For example, I could link to the endpoint for creating a new test for API Science, APIMetrics, and Runscope, with a single button or widget.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find the API definitions for API service providers to be more interesting them some of the features they showcase via their site. I will be continuing to identify the API service providers that I track on who have APIs, and defining them using OADF. <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/apis.json">You can find the APIs for my API monitoring research available in the projects APIs.json file</a>, as well as <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/companies.html">each individual APIs.json and OADF files listed on the API monitoring service providers page</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Dec 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-plan.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>How to monetize APIs is on of the top questions I get from companies, right after concerns around security and control. I have separated my research into two main buckets, the <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">first is focused on the questions I should be asking around API monetization as I'm planning my strategy</a>, with <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">the second focused on the actual plans for the operations of leading API providers</a>. There is a lot of overlap between the two, but I guess API monetization is more strategy, and API plans is more about operations.</p>
<p>When I started my <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization research</a>, it was very focused on how do you make money from your APIs, resulting in the poorly crafted title. I'm not making the same mistake with my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans research</a>, which is meant to help define a wide range of motivations for providing APIs. I think every API should have an API monetization plan, to cover the costs of acquisition, deployment, and management in a sensible way, and all APIs should have a plan--not all APIs need to have pricing.</p>
<p>This is why I labeled my research into API plans the way I did, instead of just focusing on API pricing. Not all APIs have a straightforward API monetization strategy that can be translated into "pricing", from the dark side of platforms that are just content farms, to the brighter side where platforms are focused on the social good. There are many motivations behind API operations, this is why <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/playing-with-a-json-representation-for-the-plans-for-many-of-the-leading-apis/">I'm trying to come up with some common ways to reference these motivations in a machine readable way</a>.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plan research</a>, as I'm rapidly evolving the <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks that go into planning your API operations</a>. I am also <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/playing-with-a-json-representation-for-the-plans-for-many-of-the-leading-apis/">publishing some common, machine readable definitions from leading API players like AWS, Twilio, and more</a>. All of this is very alpha work, so it might seem cluttered at first, but I am working to slice it up into a 101, 201, and 301 series, as well as some sections that are dedicated to learning, with others more focused on strategy and then execution.</p>
<p>There is a lot of work left to be done before I can compare the pricing of cloud storage APIs like Amazon and Microsoft, or messaging like Twilio and Tropo, but in the short term, the ability to find APIs that depend on donations like <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/">Court Listener</a>, and easily identify the data and content farms like Crunchbase and AngelList, who don't have real business models that API consumers can benefit from, is important to my operations.</p>
<p>Ultimately there are two primary motivations here--one, getting a machine readable way to discover and compare APIs and the resources they are providing. Second, I want to provide a way for API providers to easily understand the common patterns available across the API sector, and provide tooling they can use to craft the API plan that works best for them, based upon the successful plans already being put to work across the space.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-solution-discovery.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>During my API discovery session talk at <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIStrat Austin this last November</a>, I talked about what I see as an added dimension to the concept of API discovery, one that will become increasingly important when it comes to actually moving things forward --- discovering solutions that are API driven vs. API discovery, where a developer is looking for an API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might not seem that significant to developers, but SaaS services like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, <a href="http://apis.how/om0bbjpmec">DataFire</a>, and <a href="http://cloud-elements.com">API hubs like Cloud Elements</a>, bring this critical new dimension to how people actually will find your APIs. As nice as ProgrammableWeb has been for the last 10 years, we have to get more sophisticated about how we get our APIs in front of would-be consumers. We just can't depend on everyone who will put our API to work, immediately thinking that they need an API--most likely they are just going to need a solution to their problem, and secondarily need to understand there is an API driving things behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Of of many examples of this in the wild, could be in the area of tech support for your operations. Maybe you use Jira currently, because this is what your development team uses, but with a latest release you need something a little more public facing. When you are exploring what is possible with API reciprocity services like Zapier, and API hubs like Cloud Elements, you get introduced to other API driven solutions like Zendesk, or Desk.com from SalesForce.</p>
<p>This is just one example of how APIs can make an impact on the average business user, and will be the way API discovery happens in the future. In this scenario, I didn't set out looking for an API, but because I use API enabled service providers, I am introduced to other alternative solutions that might also help me tackle the problem I need. I may never have even known SalesForce had a help desk solution, if I wasn't already exploring the solutions Cloud Elements brings to the table.</p>
<p>As an API provider, you need to make sure your APIs are available via the growing number of <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API aggregation</a> and <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">reciprocity providers</a>, and make sure the solutions they bring to the table are easily discoverable. You need to think beyond the classic developer focused version of <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a>, and make sure and think about API driven solution discovery meant for the average business or individual user.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Dec 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-link.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>As part of evaluating 50+ companies, and their business approach to delivering APIs, I came across the Box platform. As I am looking through this diverse slice of API companies, I am looking to better understand the motivations behind providing APIs, and how sophisticated the monetization or overall planning are for their operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For most APIs, there is either no evident monetization strategy, the strategy is directly coupled with API access, or indirectly part of larger monetization strategy around existing devices, products, advertising, software as a service, or any other type of service. When it came to Box, they have a clear <a href="https://www.box.com/pricing/">SaaS pricing model</a>, as well as <a href="https://developers.box.com/pricing/">one specifically for their API ecosystem</a>--of course they are both intertwined, but the fact there are separate dimensions I felt made it worth highlighting.</p>
<p>Box has obviously put a lot of thought into their business model. In addition to having a separate set of plans for their SaaS, and developer areas, they have the developer page broken down into packages by Box platform, content, and view--which I don't fully grasp yet, and will continue to evaluate. Out of the 50+ companies I looked at, Box was the only to have such a significant separation between the SaaS and developer layers, whie also being very tightly coupled, leading to me putting aside for further consideration.</p>
<p>This latest sprint in my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plan research</a> was limited. I am guessing that the more companies I find that operate like Box, the more this will all come into focus. I'm guessing at Box central there is a command and control center with a master plan on the wall of how the SaaS side of things works with the API side, as well as a breakdown of the tiers that is based upon their operational experience over the years.</p>
<p>The best I can do from the outside is try document the patterns across SaaS and API pioneers like Box, and understand the role in plays in the API landscape. While I do see a number of successful patterns across successful API driven platforms, I do not see the holy grail of API business models, due to the number of individual resource contracts (aka documents), and specific industry constructs (aka regulation).

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/12/apis-in-the-most-mature-sectors-have-pricing-apis/">I'm looking at the pricing APIs offered by some of the API providers that are further along in their API journey</a>. This is just one example of how API providers are offering more operational level APIs to their developers, giving them control over their own integration, allowing programmatic control over account settings, billing, rate limits, and pricing.</p>
<p>I've talked about the need to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">allow for more automation</a> of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">modern API life cycle</a>, allowing API consumers to better manage their consumption across the many APIs they are depending on. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/30/making-sure-everything-you-offer-as-an-api-service-provider-is-portable/">This is why I'm spending a greater amount of time focusing on API service providers in the space practicing what they preach, and making simple, easy to use APIs available for the services they offer</a>.</p>
<p>When API service providers do this, it make it easier for API providers to extend API driven operations to their consumers. The fact that my 3Scale API management infrastructure has an API, allows me to proxy and deliver a pricing, plans, and rate limit API to my API consumers. All of these elements are present in the service composition 3Scale provides me, and the fact that they have an API allows me to extend it as part of my own API stack to my consumers.</p>
<p>This does not stop with just the API management line of my API life cycle. I can provide programmatic access to my API monitoring, because <a href="http://apis.how/h1h2mnxnc4">API Science</a> and <a href="http://apis.how/8nlsropidv">Runscope</a> has APIs, and to my SDKs via <a href="http://apis.how/ix4raakqkd">APIMATIC</a>, and multi-format versions of my API definitions using the <a href="http://apis.how/okfoexmpcm">API Transformer API.</a> Every stop along my API life cycle involves my API consumers, and in addition to me being able to automate my API operations using APIs, my developers should be able to automate their API consumption as well.</p>
<p>The moral of this story I guess, is that if you are providing services to API providers--have all of your services available via an API. Once you have done this, start thinking about how your customers will be needing to extend these services to their own consumers. Thank you for helping me understand and manage my API operations, but also assist me in helping my developers better manage their own API integration--using APIs. #thanks</p>

<p><span>I am spending a significant amount of time looking through the pricing pages for leading API providers, working to get a sense for some of the common approaches to API monetization in use across the space. Along the way I am also finding some simple and unique approaches from API providers that I wanted to share as bit-size API planning stories here on the blog.</span></p>
<p>As the API service composition of leading providers evolve in the space you see platforms getting more granular in not just how they control access to their API resources, but also how they incentivize consumption. When I say granular, I am talking about API pricing for APIs available down to the endpoint, or even HTTP verb level. Here is a description, straight from Amazon S3:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/"><em>PUT, COPY, POST, or LIST Requests = $0.005 per 1,000 requests ,GET and all other Requests = $0.004 per 10,000 requests, with delete requests being free</em></a></p>
<p class="p1">This approach represents a sophisticated view of API <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">planning</a> and <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">monetization</a>. Companies who are earlier on in their API journey often only use their GET verb, afraid of the repercussions of opening up PUT, POST, or DELETE. This is where API service composition comes into play, and gives you greater control over your resources, while also opening up access, and incentivizing the type of behavior that is beneficial to both API provider and consumer.</p>
<p><span>I've come across a number of providers who are taking this approach, and will link to them more within my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plan researc</a>h. I have a whole list of bit-size API monetization, pricing, and planning stories queued up. I will try to space them out, alongside other stories, but you will just have to suffer a little as I spend time expanding on my&nbsp;<a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans</a>&nbsp;research areas.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>

<p>As I was working to understand the coupling between the <a href="https://www.box.com">Box SaaS business model</a>, and the one applied to their API, I noticed an interesting element, <a href="https://www.box.com/pricing/">that was part of their enterprise API plan--custom terms of service</a>. At first glance it doesn't seem like much, but making elements of your TOS dynamic, allowing them up to be used as a metric within your API plans, opens up a whole world of possibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to note, this option is only available in the enterprise plan, which means only those with the most resources get this opportunity, but I still think its presence is meaningful. Right now, most terms of service and privacy policies are immovable shadows that guide how we do business and conduct our personal lives online, so the ability to think of them more dynamically, and one that could be tied to specific API access plans has huge potential. Unfortunately in the true Silicon Valley spirit, only some of this potential will be good, much of it will be in the name of exploitation, and the shifting of how power flows.</p>
<p>I have terms of service listed as a potential metric in my API plans research--we'll see where this goes, as my work evolves. I have a whole list of bit-size API monetization, pricing, and planning stories queued up. I will try to space them out, alongside other stories, but you will just have to suffer a little as I spend time expanding on my&nbsp;<a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans</a>&nbsp;research areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am seeing more operations focused API tooling emerge lately, like Stoplight.io, and as I'm <a href="https://datafire.io/">adding API reciprocity platform DataFire</a> to <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">my list of integration, automation, and interoperability providers</a>, I'm asking myself -- where is the API reciprocity platform designed specifically for managing API operations?</p>
<p>I am talking about the <a href="http://apis.how/mqashcq6gb">Zapier</a>, but just for API providers and consumers. With Datafire, I see things have a little more business and operations edge, than I've seen from more consumer offerings like Zapier. What I am hoping for, is someone to build a platform that lets you automate, integrate, and orchestrate all of your API focused operational needs across the cloud.</p>
<p>This new platform will automatically setup monitoring using <a href="http://apis.how/hobnzhnazs">API Science</a> or <a href="http://apis.how/8nlsropidv">Runscope</a>, when a new containerized microservice fires up. I could have recipes for automatically <a href="http://apis.how/zu8ty0v34u">registering public APIs.json indexes</a>, with <a href="http://apis.how/pufzfljcge">APIs.io, the open source API search engine</a>. Whenever a new developer registers via my <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">3Scale API infrastructure</a>, I could profile them on FullContact, and queue up their Twitter, LinkedIn, and Github profiles for me to engage with as part of my evangelism efforts.</p>
<p>I could go on and on, regarding tasks that I need automated across my API operations, and about how the services that I employ are providing me with APIs to manage things. All of this is making the potential for integration, interoperability, automation, transformation, and most importantly reciprocity within my API operations increase pretty dramatically. Hopefully someone will follow the lead of Zapier, and newer offerings like DataFire, and bring a solution to the table that will help alleviate some of the challenges we face daily, in the operations of our APIs.</p>

<p>I am spending a significant amount of time looking through the pricing pages for leading API providers, working to get a sense for some of the common approaches to API monetization in use across the space. Along the way I am finding some simple approaches from API providers that I wanted to share as bit-size API planning stories here on the blog.</p>
<p><a href="https://auth0.com/pricing">After recently landing on the pricing page for identity service provider Auth0</a>, I saw that they included a simple message and link to the latest blog post about API pricing changes. It is a simple, subtle, yet very prominent approach to making sure your API consumers are aware of pricing changes that may impact their integration. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/04/educating-api-developers-with-each-login-over-at-cloudelements/">I recently wrote about providing a messaging area to reach developers upon platform login</a>, but this approach from Auth0 is about providing relevant messaging no matter where you are at in the developer portal--not just at login.</p>
<p>Couple of lessons for me, extracted from this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Prominent FMA - </strong>Providing a prominently placed, flexible messaging area, can help make sure your API consumers stay up to speed on the latest, when it comes to platform operations.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Pricing Storytelling - </strong>Telling the story around each change in pricing is a critical aspect of operation. Publishing a story on your blog, syndicating out through your social channels, and prominent placement via a FMA is key.</li>
</ol>
<p>This help rekenforce the fact that we should make sure to regularly communicating out our decisions around API monetization. Also making sure there is a saturation factor to our messaging, and that it is available via our blogs, Twitter, LinkedIn, and any other relevant page or channel used to reach API consumers.</p>
<p>I have a whole list of bit-size API monetization, pricing, and planning stories queued up. I will try to space them out, alongside other stories, but you will just have to suffer a little as I spend time expanding on my <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a>, and <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans</a> research areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://history.apievangelist.com">A lot can be learned from the pioneers of the API space</a>. Companies like Amazon and Twilio have been used as a model by many providers, and are something I reference often across my research and storytelling. These providers have been playing the API game for a while, so they have a wealth of experience to bring to the table, but they also are working with well defined, and highly valuable API driven resources which we can learn from.</p>
<p>I'm neck deep in evaluating the pricing of modern APIs, and Amazon and Twilio both provide a wealth of things to consider when it comes to <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a>. One of the common patterns that has emerged for me, is the presence of pricing APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-price-list-api/">AWS Price List API</a></strong> - In order to meet the needs of these customers and to foster the development of even more tools that focus on cost management, budgeting, and the like, we are launching the AWS Price List API.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/pricing">Twilio Pricing API</a> </strong>- The Pricing REST resource provides a simple API to pull real time, account-specific pricing for Twilio's messaging, voice and phone number products.</li>
</ul>
<p>As Amazon says on their page, "Many AWS customers and partners have been asking for a programmatic way to access prices for AWS services. Current customers and partners would like to make sure that their budgeting, forecasting, and analytics tools are able to analyze AWS prices without having to resort to scraping our web site." These types of API resources provide the rest of us with a glimpse at what the future possibly holds for our own APIs.</p>
<p>The world of cloud computing, voice, and messaging APIs are significantly more mature than other areas being served by APIs, but how the leading API providers are monetizing their APIs, and develop tooling for their consumers, gives us elements we should all be considering for our own road maps. I hope you are ready for a time, where the resources you are serving up via your API, are as well defined, and &nbsp;as competitive as cloud computing resources is right now.</p>
<p>it is easy to think about our APIs within the silo of our community, but when you begin to think about API consumers who will be using not just 2-3 APIs, but 20-30, or even 200-300 APIs, the importance of there being a pricing API to assist with cost management becomes very clear. For API providers, all aspects of our developer facing solutions should be API driven, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">allowing API consumers to automate their applications, keys, usage, and other vital aspects of API integration and consumption</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Dec 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-rss-icon.png" alt="" width="190" align="right" /></p>
<p>A blog RSS feed is still my number one way to monitor what is happening across the API space. I also use RSS from <a href="https://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alerts</a> and <a href="http://www.talkwalker.com/en/social-media-intelligence/">TalkWalker</a> to monitor a variety of leading API industry keywords. RSS is an important information gathering format, and I wanted to help some of my non-developer followers, understand how they can aggregate RSS feeds across a variety of topics, clean up, and publish a centralized API for all feeds.</p>
<p>To take advantage of this advice, you will need to have three separate accounts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a></strong> - API reciprocity provider, helping you move your bits and bytes around online.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://accounts.google.com/">Google</a></strong> - Online spreadsheet solution, which can be used to deploy APIs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a></strong> - API deployment and management as a service provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have accounts with these three services, you can take advantage of the features each brings to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pull RSS From Providers</strong> - Using Zapier, you can setup Zaps, which will allow you to connect RSS feeds, and route them to your Google Sheets. Setup a recipe for each RSS feed you will want to pull, store, and make available later.</li>
<li><strong>Google Sheet Content Store </strong>- Google Sheets provides you a data store, which your Zapier recipe will route all new RSS posts to. Depending on how many feeds you pull, and aggregate, you can setup one or many documents, and worksheets.</li>
<li><strong>Publish Central API -</strong> Using Restlet, you can setup what is called an entity store, which pulls the content of your spreadsheet(s), and stores them locally for publishing as an API. Once deployed, you can then setup a web API, which provides all content pulled via RSS, as a single API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, many developers are going to ask me, "why the hell would you do this"? First, this isn't for you--it is for folks without programming experience. This post is meant to be the outline, for an actual API integration how-to series I am working on, and is about introducing non-developers to what is possible with Zapier, Google Sheets, and Restlet.</p>
<p>My goal, is to help establish a robust toolbox that non-developers can put to work for them, and take more control of their worlds. Publishing APIs using the wide variety of approaches available to us via Zapier, Google, and Restlet, puts a lot of power and control into the hands of the average business user. Once I get a handful of API deployment examples, I will work on providing more examples of how these business users can then put that API to work in their own world.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Dec 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-minimum-viable.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>There are some pretty good examples (in my opinion), of well defined API service providers across the API landscape right now-- companies, who are selling services specifically to API providers. You know how you can tell a good provider? They do one thing, or just a handful of things well, it is well presented, and they also have an API -- who woulda thought that? Companies selling services to API providers should also do so via an API!</p>
<p>I am most definitely biased in showcase these companies, but a couple examples of this in action can be found with <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC</a>, <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a>, <a href="/admin/blog/3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a href="https://securedb.co/">SecureDB</a>, and <a href="https://www.apiscience.com/">API Scrience</a>. These are all companies that I support, but I support them because they offer valuable services to companies who are operating APIs, and they do it in a simple, well thought out way, complete with an API.</p>
<p>When you are crafting the strategy for the API service provider you would like to launch, here are my recommendations of what you should be including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Website</strong> - Simple, modern, and informative website for your customers to discover, and on-board with the services you offer.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - Have a genuine, active Twitter account that actually engages in conversations with community.</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - Establish an active, and meaningful Github presence via user account or organization, and make it your open work bench.</li>
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - Provide a thoughtful, active, and informative blog to comunicate with the community, your customers, and the public.</li>
<li><strong>API</strong> - If you are selling APIs to API providers, you need to make sure and be drinking the kool-aid with an API of your own.</li>
<li><strong>SaaS</strong> - Follow the principles of software as a service. I do not want to deal with old ways of purchasing and licensing software.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong> - Offer tiered pricing, so that we can kick the tires, and small companies (or groups) like myself can actually afford what you are offering.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong> - Make sure you are there to support me as an API service provider--I am depending on you to scale my business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there are many other elements I could also recommend, but I think this is a minimum viable API service provider definition. This isn't rocket science, or my unique view of the space. This is how API service providers should be operating as we go into 2016, and reflects the successful providers I keep an eye on.</p>
<p>The most telling characteristic for me in all of this, is when an API service provider does not have an API. I fundamentally believe that a service provider cannot help me be successful with my API operations, unless they also execute their own successful API strategy. When you look through the website of someone trying to sell you a service, and you cannot find a publicly available API -- turn around and go look for another provider.</p>
<p>As I think about the most valuable services in the space, and the ones that are helping me operate my business, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2015/12/03/if-i-cannot-scale-it-on-my-own-or-use-a-service-provider-i-do-not-scale-it/">beyond what I can scale on my own</a>, they are often small companies, focusing on a specific problem set. 3Scale focuses on API management, while Runscope and API Science focus on API monitoring, and APIMATIC addresses my SDK needs. Ultimately in 2015, I need my API services just like need the rest of my digital resources, as simple, intuitive, easy to use APIs, so that I can orchestrate them as I see fit.</p>

<p>I spent the weekend adding a <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren media type</a> to my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/buildingblock/">API building blocks API</a>, in support of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">my API life cycle map</a>&nbsp;work. Every time I dive into using Siren, and begin applying hypermedia constraints to my API design, I'm pleasantly surprised by what I learn. I am not a hypermedia evangelist, I am just trying to share what I learn, as I go evolve, and hopefully add to some of the existing knowledge that is floating around out there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This work on my building blocks API is still very much a work in progress, when it comes to my own understanding of hypermedia, but also how I can use it to craft a more meaningful story around API(s). The first major benefit I realized, was instead of just have a basic JSON representation of my API building blocks, I was immediately forced to consider some very important dimensions around the JSON data I was serving up.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Properties -</strong> What are the properties of the collection returned, or individual data sets.</li>
<li><strong>Entities -</strong> What are the actual structured objects that I am returning, and how do they relate.</li>
<li><strong>Actions - </strong>What actions can be taken around my data, and how can a developer engage with it.</li>
<li><strong>Links - </strong>What relevant links about the entities, and the information it contains are present.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before this, I would just have a JSON array or object, which is essentially what I have under properties now, but now that I'm using Siren, I also have other meaningful relationships between my data present as entities. I also can provide relevant actions and links that any developer will potentially need, when they are working with the data provided.</p>
<p>For me, this evolution is significant. It isn't just about alleviating my version control challenges, or providing &nbsp;the perfect client (well I do have some client ambitions in doing this), it is just about helping think more deeply about the relationships between all of my data, as well as the meaningful actions that can be taken with it. It takes me well beyond about ticking off a checkbox, that I've vomited up JSON instead of HTML, and pushing me to think more critically about my data, and how it will actually be used.</p>

        <p>If you were at <a href="https://twitter.com/defrag">@defrag</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@apistrat</a> in November, you know that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">I am working to better understand the often complex world of APIs using the Subway map concept</a>. My goal is to better understand the overall API life cycle, as well as the life cycle of individual APIs, and how I can articulate, strategize, and execute on it all, using a subway experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://restlet.com/http-status-codes-map">It made me happy to see the folks over at Restlet playing with the same concept</a>&nbsp;(we didn't coordinate on it honestly), to help articulate HTTP status codes, which is a very important topic for the space, and we need more education tools, and stories around it. Using the subway map analogy, Restlet provides a representation of the five areas of status codes, providing a simple way to explore them, and find a description of each individual status code.</p>

<p>The subway map they provide is currently a static map, but this is one of the biggest potential areas in using this analogy for me, is that with the right JavaScript + JSON voodoo, you can make it real-time, and interactive. This is something I'm working on to bring the entire lifecycle to the forefront this month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nice work Restlet team, I enjoy these efforts by providers to help educate the space, especially when they do it in creative and fun ways like this.</p>

<p>I started API Evangelist, because I saw a huge deficiency in the overall API conversation--nobody was talking about the business of all of this, and how you actually make money doing this emerging web API thing. Over time, I also discovered that very few people were also studying, and discussing the politics of APIs. Sure, when something flares up around terms of service violations, or there is an acquisition that the community dislikes, we discuss it, but we have to talk about the political issues in real-time, not at polarize-time.</p>
<p>From my vantage point, the business and politics of API operations, internal as well as external influences, continue to be the number one things that negatively impact API operations, over anything technical. Let's just look at a couple examples of this in action:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Money -</strong> How are you going to operate an API without any money? Either from paying customers, or internally from other sources.</li>
<li><strong>Doers -</strong> If your business has been built on traditional sales and support models, evolving consumers to a doers mentality will not be an easy.</li>
<li><strong>Competing Interests -</strong> Various groups within an organization competing for budget, attention, and any other way regular current operations impact your API vision.</li>
<li><strong>Management Change -</strong> Your CTO had your back, and the new one not so much. It could be about lower level or mid-management support, all the way to the top. When the champions leave, API programs often dry up on the vine.</li>
<li><strong>Industry Regulation -</strong> Silicon loves to be in denial of the larger world, and the regulatory frameworks that are in place across many industries--once you grow big enough, or operate in the right space, this will become clearer.</li>
<li><strong>Scope</strong> - How big are things? Software? Teams? Systems? Processes? There are many things that are big in the enterprise and even small businesses, that will resist decoupling and unbundling. People just do not think of things in small, bite-size chunks--it just isn't what they've been taught.</li>
<li><strong>You</strong> - Your vision might not be a fit for a business, organization, or industry, and you may be coming to the table with unrealistic expectations of what APIs can do.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of the common business and political roadblocks you will encounter doing APIs. I do not care how solid your API design, and deployment strategy might be, when you come up against many of these currents listed above, the tech does not always win. I've seen API effort, after API effort fail because of these common challenges, that we all face.</p>
<p>For us technologists, it can be easy to sit at our corners, and craft a vision of the perfect world we want, but often it is oil, in a water filled world. I am not saying your API vision can't make change, but you have to equipped to understand that 75% of your efforts in the enterprise, organizations, and government agencies will be about culture, politics, and business--not technical.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Dec 2015</span>
        <p>I am spending some time taking another look at my "<a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">client research</a>", which started out as just about Postman and PAW, but now contains ten separate services I'm and bundling into this area of research. As with all my research areas, these project repos shift, evolve, split and marge with time, as the API space changes, and my awareness of it grows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I &nbsp;completely understand the term "client" doesn't provide an adequate label for this bucket of research, but for now, it will have to do. As I add a couple of new services to the bucket, and made my way through some of the existing ones I had, I wanted to step back and look at what they were offering, but more importantly the message that went around quantify what tehse companies were offering.</p>
<p>When it comes to what I call "lines along the API lifecycle", I saw these areas represented.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-client-lifecycle-1.png" alt="" width="80%" align="middle" /></p>
<p>This is where the API client line potentially intersects with all of these other API life-cycle lines. However, When you start to analyze the features or building blocks offered by these service providers, you begin to see each stop along along the API client line, which becomes pretty critical to other areas of the API lifecycle.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-client-lifecycle-2.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>I know that what I am saying might not be completely clear, it isn't for me either. That is why I tell stories, to try and find the patterns, and learn how to articulate all the moving parts. I'm still trying to figure out what to call my research, alongside all of these API service providers working to define just exactly what it is they are selling as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-client-lifecycle-3.png" alt="" width="80%" align="middle" /></p>
<p>The more time I spend with <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">my API client research</a>, the more all of this comes into focus. The problem is that these companies are rapidly adding in new features, in demand to what their customers are needing, which keeps me on my toes, as well as increases overlap with other lines that I track on along the API life-cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wanted to take a moment, update my research, and take another look at the companies, and tooling at play.</p>

<p>This is another one of those topics I talk a lot about, but only found few examples of me talking about on the blog--API service composition. If you aren't familiar with the concept, it is the art of taking digital resources (aka APIs), and mix and match them in different ways, until you find the right approach to delivering APIs, that provides value for both provider and consumer.</p>
<p>API service composition is about taking the basic building blocks of any web API, the URL, path, and VERBS (ability to get, add, update, and delete), and put them into as many different configurations as you think makes sense. Limiting who can access, how much they use, restrict by time frame, and crafting different pricing for different users or groups, require trial periods, setup costs, and even restricting to specific countries. API service composition is all about taking your APIs, <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">and if you are using modern API infrastructure like from 3Scale</a>, you can compose any service you desire, serving it up to anyone, in a secure way, using the open Internet.</p>
<p>This is the magic of modern API-driven solutions, when an API can be any digital resource, from simple data and content, to media like images, audio, and video, all the way to an increasing number of devices like fitness trackers, thermostats in our homes, and even our cars. When you have all of these resources at your finger tips, and the ability to compose them into any possible package, to satisfy any group of consumers--you have unlimited potential.</p>
<p>This is why so many companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are jumping on the API train. When you do APIs right, you gain a new level of control over the increasing amount of digital resources that are dominating our lives. API service composition is the key to all of this, and is one of the parts of the journey I enjoy the most--composing meaningful API service that offer value to consumers, and have the potential to change how business, industries, and even government can work.</p>

<p>I'm working my way through some of the low hanging fruit in my API notebook, when it comes to stories, and found a story thread I was working on regarding automating API key management. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/14/storing-api-keys-in-the-private-master-github-repository-for-use-in-github-pages/">I'm personally storing my keys, across the private master branch for my API reps, because I don't have any super-sensitive data, and it helps me manage across hundreds of APIs, in a central way</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">I've talked about the need to automate API key management in the past</a>--with the number of APIs we are using, to reach the level of security we will need, the lower level of keys will need a global refresh and management process. This level of keys most likely won't ever result in large scale security breaches, but will cause plenty headaches for both API providers and consumers.</p>
<p>If you use one of the following API management solutions, they provide you with an API for managing your API keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs"><strong>3Scale</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://apigee.com/docs/management/apis"><strong>Apigee</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://tyk.io/v1.8/rest-api/api-key-management/"><strong>Tyk</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>This will help you manage your keys, if you are an API provider, but doesn't do a lot for you to manage your API keys across providers, as an API consumer. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">Amazon provides a key management solution</a>, but at first glance it appears to be something you can use to manage keys across your AWS infrastructure (am I wrong?)--which makes sense for supporting AWS objectives. ;-)</p>
<p>When I wrote my last post on the growing need for API key management solutions, I received a number of email and DMs, which yielded two pretty interesting open source key management solutions, <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vault">Vault</a> and <a href="https://github.com/square/keywhiz">Keywhiz</a>. I'm going to evaluate these solutions for their viability as a back-end for an API driven, API key management solution, but I have a lot more work to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also working with a partner of mine, <a href="https://securedb.co/">SecureDB, and consider the possibility fo developing an encrypted API key management solution</a>, which then would be accessible via their secure API. They are looking for some interesting solutions like this to be developed on their platform, so if you are a developer, and looking for a viable micro startup idea--let me know.</p>
<p>As with everything in my world, the concept of automating API keys using APIs, and managing of keys across API platforms, is a work in progress--stay tuned!</p>

<p>I've done this a couple of times now. I took&nbsp;<a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>, and created my Screenshot API, and used&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> to create my Image Manipulation API. These are two openly licensed software solutions, which I took, and am using as an API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are my licensing considerations? If I keep my server side code licensed according to the specifications, am I fine? PhantomJS is licensed under BSD, and ImageMagick is Apache 2.0. Does the licensing extend itself to the commercial services I would potentially offer via an API interface? There are lots of questions to satisfy, before I move forward--I guess I am looking for a precedent.</p>
<p>I am evaluating at a number of openly licensed software solutions right now to deliver a variety of stops along the API life-cycle, ranging from design, to deployment, virtualization, and much more. As always, I am trying to better understand the layers involved, and how software licenses, patent, and potentially copyright might apply.</p>

<p>As I came across, I was also considering <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">different access plans across my APIs</a>, with some of the plans allowing for updating existing content in the system--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-bad-actors-on-both-sides-of-the-api-fence/">the topic of abuse of API access was on my mind</a>. I'm curious if ORES could be applied to any sort of content or data post via a PUT / PATCH API request?</p>
<p><span>Even if it didn't 100% out of the repo, maybe it could it be evolved to help manage the PUT / PATCH layer of API operations, allowing platforms to open up a little bit more, and open up more of their HTTP verbs, to a wider audience. Something like this could go a long way to helping API providers secure, and stabilize their API operations, and loosen service composition restrictions a little further.</span></p>
<p><span>Just a thought, as I'm kicking the tires of some of the open source API offerings I come across. Seems like to me, there is an opportunity for someone to deploy these open solutions as a service, and help API providers open up a little more.

<p>I have been learning about hypermedia over the last three years now, and only earlier this year, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/11/applying-a-little-hypermedia-is-helping-me-tighten-down-my-api-design-and-tell-a-better-api-story/">I began playing with Siren to help me craft a better experience around my API industry news and link curation API</a>. My motivations in going down this hypermedia road was never about easing my client side pain, or helping me with future versions of my API--I am just not that sophisticated of an operation.</p>
<p>I started playing with hypermedia to help evolve the experience around the API news I was curating each week, making it so you could browse week by week, month by month, but also by topic, company, author, etc. I'm still trying to figure it out all out, and honestly the project is currently in the ditch after hitting the wall this fall, and not really giving a shit about the flow of API news. (I am better now, thx!)</p>
<p>Now in December, I'm trying to take my building block API, which provides access to over <a href="http://apievangelist.com/list-of-things-i-am-thinking-about-tonight.html">600 of the common patterns I've tracked on across the API space</a>. These are the features offered by API service providers, and the competitive advantage brought to the table by the successful API providers I keep an eye on, and they are all potential stops along the API life-cycle I am working to define.</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">My API building block API</a> is a pretty standard content API, providing each element broken down by category, and type, with other supporting details. However, now I need to be able to plot them on a subway map, with an endless number of configurations, and dimensions to the journey. Via my building block API, I need to return any single stop along the API life-cycle, but along with it I need to provide the next stop in the line, the previous stop (paging 101), but then if I hit a transfer station, or other element, I need to offer an unlimited number of dimensions.</p>
<p>While I am concerned with the behavior of my client, it isn't the normal hypermedia-focused arguments I usually hear. I need to be able to deliver a subway-like transport experience for over 600 stops along the API lifecycle, for any possible API you can image. A simple API design just isn't going to cut it, I need a request and response model that can dynamically deliver the API life-cycle transport experience that I am looking to extend to my users.</p>
<p>I wish I had thought this out more, when I first got started designing my building block API. ;-(</p>

<p>Most of the tooling and services I come across in the API space, are designed for developers. As I play with more services, and put tools to work, trying understand their role in the API space, some take a lot of work to figure out, while others are pretty clear--it will be these tools and services that the masses of business users adopt, as part of the API evolution that is occurring online currently.</p>
<p>There are just a handful of services out there right now, that I think are mainstream ready, and are something that the average business user of the web, should be playing with right now--here are three of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a></strong> - Deploy API from a Google Spreadsheet.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.blockspring.com/">Blockspring</a></strong> - Use APIs in a Google Spreadsheet.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.form.io/">Form.io</a></strong> - Deploy an API as form, via Single Page App.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other services and tools out there that will help you deploy and consume APIs, but these stand out, because they help the average business user solve real world business problems they are facing, without needing to write code. They also anchor there solutions in existing tooling that are ubiquitous, and part of every day business operations--the spreadsheet and the form.</p>
<p>Developers might care about the technical details of APIs, and evangelists like me might be able to convince some of the average business users of the potential of APIs, but before we can bring the masses on-board, we will need the right tools. Restlet, Blockspring, and Form.io have the potential to be these tools, and help the "normals" become active participants in the API economy, but more importantly find the (API driven) solutions they need for the problems they face every day.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Dec 2015</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-virtulization.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>This conversation has come up over 10 times this month, at <a href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag</a>, <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">APIStrat</a>, and online conversations via Skype and GHangouts. The concept of API virtualization solutions. I am not talking about virtualization in the cloud computing and Docker sense, although that will play a fundamental role in the solutions I am trying to articulate. What I am focusing on is about providing sandbox, QA environments, and other specialized virtualization solutions for API providers, that make API consumers worlds much easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've touched on examples of this in the wild, with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/05/api-sandbox-and-simulator-from-carvoyant/">my earlier post on&nbsp;API sandbox and simulator from Carvoyant</a>, which is an example of the need for virtualization solutions that are tailored for the connected automobile solution. Think of this, but for every aspect of the fast growing Internet of Things space. The IoT demand is about the future opportunity, I've talked about the current need, when I published, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/11/i-wish-all-apis-had-sandbox-environment-by-default/">I Wish All APIs Had Sandbox Environment By Default</a>.</p>
<p>I see envision 1/3 of these solutions being about deploying Docker containers on demand, 1/3 being about virtualizing the API using common API definitions, and the final 1/3 being about the data provided with the solutions. This is where I think the right team(s) could develop some pretty unique skills when it comes to delivering specialized simulations tailored for testing home, automobile, agriculture, industrial, transportation, and other unique API solutions.</p>
<p>We are going to need "virtualized" versions of our APIs, whether or not it is for web, mobile, devices, or just for managing APIs throughout their life cycle. You can see a handful of the <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com/">current API virtualizations out there on my research in this area</a>, but I predict the demand for more robust, and specialized API virtualization solutions is going to dramatically increase as the space continues its rapid expansion. I just wanted to put it out there, and encourage all y'all to think more about this area, and push forward the concept of API virtualization as you are building all the bitch'n tooling you are working on.</p>

<p>I get regular links sent to me, and foiks telling me that freemium API access is a bad idea. That it doesn't help your API sales funnel, and was something that was just a thing, for a brief moment in time. The folks who always bring me these stories, are not API consumers, they are business folks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree, there are some really bad examples of freemium in play across the API space, and with the bad behavior we see from API consumers, I fully understand why stories make their rounds--leaving a bad taste in the mouths of API providers for freemium access.</p>
<p>The disconnect that allows this to happen in my opinion, is <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/30/how-do-i-price-my-api-resources/">folks not thinking through their monetization, plans, and pricing in an API centric way</a>. Folks approach it as a across the board monetization approach, and do not think of it as a tool to apply on a resource by resource basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Freemium is just one tool in your toolbox, and should evaluated at every step in the monetization planning for your APIs, and used, or not used, based upon your well planned on-boarding funnel for your API consumers.</p>
<p>Consider educational access to your API resources (also one tool in your toolbox), which is a common offering from API providers. You wouldn't offer this in all scenarios, it just doesn't make sense, but you aso wouldn't just dismiss it as a bad idea--you keep in your toolbox for when it makes sense.</p>
<p>I see API operations let by business folks dismiss freemium as a bad idea because they don't experience on how it influences in the on-boarding process, but I also see API operations let by developers dismiss the need for traditional sales approaches, and hurt themselves in similiar ways.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">I recommend iterating through the list of common API monetization building blocks I've aggregated from leading API providers,</a> for each resource you are planning to release. <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">If you have a modern API infrastructure provider like 3Scale</a>, you will be able to define individual plans, using a variety units of value, at different rates, rooted in who you are targeting with your API resources--make sure you have as many tools as possible in your toolbox, don't throw any away.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Dec 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-sharing.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>My <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a> began as a news site, and evolved into a directory of the APIs that I monitor in the space. <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">I published APIs.json indexes for the almost 1000 companies I am trackig on, with almost 400 OADF files for some of the APIs I've profiled in more detail</a>. My mission around the project so far, has been to create an open source, machine readable repo for the API space.</p>
<p>I have &nbsp;had two recent occurrences that are pushing me to expand on my API Stack work. First, I have other entities who want to contribute monitoring data and other elements I would like to see collected, but haven't had time. The other is I that I have started spidering the URLs of the API portals I track on, and need a central place to store the indexes, so that others can access.</p>
<p>Ultimately I'd like to see the API Stack act as a public repo, where anyone can grab the data they need to discovery, evaluate, integrate, and stay in tune with what APIs are doing, or not doing. In addition to finding OADF, API Blueprint, and RAML files by crawling and indexing API portals, and publishing in a public repo, I want to build out the other building blocks that I index with APIs.json, like pricing, and TOS changes, and potentially monitoring, testing, performance data available.</p>
<p>Next I will publish some pricing, monitoring, and portal site crawl indexes to the repo, for some of the top APIs out there, and start playing with the best way to store the JSON, and other files, and provide an easy way explore and play with the data. If you have any data that you are collecting, and would like to contribute, or have a specific need you'd like to see tracked on, let me know, and I'll add to the road map.</p>
<p>My goal is to go for quality and completeness of data there, before I look to scale, and expand the quantity of information and tooling available. Let me know if you have any thoughts or feedback.</p>

<p>While it will never be 100% complete or perfect, I finally have <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">my API stack</a> in a way that lets me add, evolve, scale, and deprecate the endpoints as I need. I've been centralizing all of my APIs, <a href="https://github.com/Kin-Lane">underneath a single Github organization</a>, with each API as a single repository.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each API has from one to around 50 endpoints, existing in its own repo, with the master branch set to private, and the gh-pages branch existing as a public repository, and contains the public face of the API (aka portal). This approach is giving me standardized way to manage my fast growing API stack, in a way that I know how to find anything, anytime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the API itself runs on a series of AWS EC2 instances, the private repository is the blueprint for its operation, with server side code, database backups, and details of its overall configuration. The public, or Github Pages branch of the API, acts as the public portal, with docs, client code, OADF file, and of course an <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/apis.json">APIs.json file</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">Within my master API Github organization I have 33 separate API repos</a>, with a single master public page, which acts as the central index of all APIs, with a single portal portal with APIs.json file. I use this page to navigate to all my APIs, and I rely on Github heavily to manage the public, and private side of my API operations (emphasis on public).</p>
<p>Now that I have my house somewhat in order, when I'm looking to start a new API, I simple create a new repo, add an APIs.json, and OADF file, and begin crafting the API resource that I need. Every other <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">stop along the API life cycle from deployment to deprecation</a> uses this central Github repo, and it's API definitions, as its central source of truth and operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still have a lot of housekeeping left to do, to get things in order, but I can't help myself, and I keep adding new APIs. I'm hoping I can keep automating my API lifeycle using this approach, allowing me to tackle a growing API stack, while staying a one person operation.</p>

<p>I am continuing my series on helping non-developers realize they can publish, and put APIs to work, without having an API expert in their pocket, using <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheets</a>, and <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a>. Its no secret that Restlet is an API Evangelist partner, and they are my partner because they are the easiest way to deploy a web API--something I am trying to help the "normals" understand the untapped potential of.</p>
<p><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">As I finish up my @APIStrat conference again</a>, for the sixth time, I'm reminded that I need to harvest the essential Twitter exhaust from the conference, otherwise if I wait too long, I won't be able to get it. You see, Twitter limits what you can grab from the Twitter API by either time, or number of Tweets, so I can only gather X amount of Tweets, and if I wait too long, I'm often out of luck. It is critical that I do this right away, and depending on how loud the Twitter exhaust is, I need to do it while the event is still going on.</p>
<p>To start, you obviously need a Twitter account, but you will also need a Zapier, Google and Restlet account. Then using Zapier you can gather the following Twitter data points, and send to a Google Sheets:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Mentions</li>
<li>New Followers</li>
<li>New Favorites</li>
<li>New Tweets</li>
</ul>
<p>How you store these in Google Sheets is up to you, but I recommend breaking each data point down as its own sheet, and even by separate time-frame like day, week, or month. It helps to keep things broken up into smaller chunks, when you are using Google Sheets as a data store--tricks of the trade!</p>
<p>Zapier gives you everything you need to setup the Zaps that route mentions, followers, favorites, and your tweets to the Google Sheet(s), and once they are there, you can clean up, edit, and organize as you see fit. Next Restlet comes into the picture, allowing you deploy an "entity store" from your Google Spreadsheet. Once you have your entity store connected to the Google Spreadsheet, using their simple wizard, you can then deploy as a web API--Restlet walks you through the entire process, no code necessary.</p>
<p>What you do with your API is up to you, but the important part for me, is I have the references to the Tweets and followers from Twitter that are important to me. When I need to reference the mentions for an event back in 2013, I can do it. When I need to create a special outreach list to anyone who Tweeted at our most recent event, I can do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simple API solutions, using Zapier, Google Sheets, and Restlet, are empowering to the average business and organizational user who is looking to just get their work done, track on what is important to them, but in an API-centric way which will then allow the information to be then used in web and mobile apps, but also spreadsheets, widgets, and other API driven goodies.</p>

<p>I've seen something at an ever increasing pace lately, situations where very intelligent software engineers hit a wall, and realize they do not understand the fundamental building blocks of HTTP, and the web that we are all using daily. It makes my heart ache, because I remember when I found myself in the same place, and still suffer from the deprivation I experienced.</p>
<p>Whether it was my time programming in Microsoft-land, Drupal, WordPress, or any other Web 2.0-land, I eventually realized how much was hidden from me behind the curtain. When you bundled this with the fact I'm a fairly privileged white male software engineer who can be fairly clueless about what is around me, I missed a lot. Something I still find myself recovering from in 2015, even after five years of exclusively studying web APIs--you know, the ones that use HTTP for transport?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not stupid, but with my lazerfocus &trade;, I often miss a lot. I feel that many of the smart people I know suffer from a similar illness, but do not have the fortitude for transparency, or the humbleness to accept, that will allow them to move on. Programming language dogma, and platform or framework dependencies can be a powerful thing, but they can also do a lot protect us from what we need to learn to actually be successful, and grow.</p>
<p>At this point, i question everything. What I know. What a platform might be hiding from me, to sell back to me as feature, and what is the bigger picture of the Internet that I use everyday, and often take for granted.</p>

I will also be studying the portability of services that are being sold to API providers, and pushing for more import / export features like Runscope offers.</p>
<p>I will be tracking on the API definitions used by service providers like Runscope, across the 26+ areas I monitor, and trying to better understand the JSON schemas they are using to encourage the portability of their services. The API definition, response, and request models put forth by companies, tells a lot about the service they offer in my opinion, and I'd say the overall portability of services is another strong characteristics I will be keeping an eye out for.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-bad-actors-on-both-sides-of-the-api-fence/">As I think about the bad behavior that occurs on the API consumption side of API operations</a>, I'm considering ways that I can help API providers address these problems when they arise within their ecosystems. What can you do when bad actors have access to your APIs? Also more critically for some providers, what can you do to prevent bad actors from on-boarding with your API program at all?</p>
<p>I strongly believe that companies should be as public with their API efforts as possible, but when it comes to which developers you let in, and which ones you don't, I'm finding I'm becoming more conservative in my thoughts--as long as you are transparent about the process. I'm still forming all of my thoughts around this (hence the blog post), and I'm sure is something that will keep evolving as I continue to push forward my awareness of the API space.</p>
<p>When I see a new sign-up for my own APIs, I like to be able to verify who the new consumer is. I like to see a real name, and potentially a company name, but also when I Google the combination, I like to see an active Twitter, LinkedIn, or Github account. It is easy to tell real people, from personas that live n the shadows, and I prefer verifiable people use my APIs.</p>
<p>If you are a public API consumer, I do not think it is unreasonable to ask you to maintain some sort of public presence, to verify who you are, and what you do. I know for many enterprise developers this is insanity, which is why I put LinkedIn profiles in the mix--I do not expect everyone to be super popular on Twitter, and a die-hard Github user. However, in 2015, you really should consider!</p>
<p>As I'm going through my own API on-boarding process, trying to make smoother (it isn't the best right now), I am considering how I will articulate what behavior I expect of my API consumers--in plain English. This post is just part of my iteration, putting my thoughts out to the universe, getting feedback when I can, but ultimately knowing that I am the sole decision maker when it comes to setting the tone in my own API community.</p>
<p>What tone are you setting? Do you verify your API consumers? What is the bar you set for a place at the table?</p>

<p>I am continuing to push my research around API <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">monetization</a>, <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">plans</a>, and <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/">partners</a> forward, whilep preparing for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">my API lifecycle keynote at @Defrag and @APIStrat</a>. Along the way, I am also exercising some of my API pricing and planning strategies with my partner in crime at <a href="http://apiware.io">APIware</a>, as we think through some new products that we are developing.</p>
<p>How I approach pricing for API products, is on a resource by resource basis, <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">considering all of the API monetization tools in my toolbox</a>. For example, when i launch two new API endpoints for <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/11/27/adding-a-new-alpha-endpoint-to-explode-api-oadf-into-separate-files-for-each-unique-endpoint/">exploding API definitions</a>, and <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/11/27/adding-a-new-alpha-endpoint-to-tell-me-how-big-my-api-endpoints-are/">telling me how big my APIs are</a>, I quickly run down my list of monetization building blocks to see which areas will apply to these new resources. The reality is, until these APIs leave an alpha stage, they will just exist in my internal consumption tier.</p>
<p>Even though these APIs aren't ready for prime time yet, I am already thinking through which of my API monetization building blocks will apply. Will I charge for access? Are they available in the freemium tier? Do I offer only a trial version of them? Ultimately it all comes down to who I will be targeting with these resources, and in this case it will be primarily hardcore API architects--something that helps me define how I will price these resources, and which service tiers I make them available in.</p>
<p>When it comes to generating revenue from APIs, rarely are there a one size fits all solution. You should be considering each resource based upon the value it brings to the table, who you are targeting with this resource, and <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">weighing all the tools in a modern API monetization toolbox</a>. Remember the business of APIs resembles the technology of APIs, where you do things in small chunks, and you iterate, until you find the optimal value proposition that works for the platform, and your consumers.</p>

        <p><a href="https://api.foxycart.com/docs"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/foxycart-api-screenshot.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am still catching up on my feeds, and open browser tabs, and one tab that has been open for a couple of weeks is <a href="https://medium.com/@lukestokes/why-your-colleagues-still-don-t-understand-hypermedia-apis-1a5a2cf82540">Why Your Colleagues Still Don&rsquo;t Understand Hypermedia APIs</a>, by Luke Stokes (<a href="https://twitter.com/lukestokes">@lukestokes</a>) of <a href="http://www.foxycart.com/">FoxyCart</a>. The post is very thought provoking for me, and represents what I feel is the very pragmatic front of the hypermedia movement, from someone who has helped move the concept of a hypermedia API from academic discussion to reality, with the <a href="https://api.foxycart.com/docs">FoxyCart API</a>.</p>
<p>His challenges at the end of his post really set the stage for me:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>So how do we find a balance between idealism about what Hypermedia API documentation systems &ldquo;should&rdquo; be and what they practically are? How can we move the whole ecosystem forward by encouraging client developers to code to link relationships instead of hard-coded URLs? How do we help pave the way for the future but not look like unsophisticated outsiders in the process? What pragmatic steps should we take to be like the other cool kids using standard documentation presentations while at the same time saying, &ldquo;Um, yeah, don&rsquo;t do that. Don&rsquo;t code to the URL, code to the link relationship instead.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>For me, his questions illuminate the canyon between where the API community is currently with API design, and the vision of where we should be going with our API design practices. The more I play and learn with hypermedia, the less I see it as the lofty vision for the future, and the more I see it as a set of practical design patterns that will make my API work more meaningful.</p>
<p>The shortcomings of API definitions like Swagger (now OADF), is that it was designed for documenting your API, after it was already designed--awesome, but not remotely about API design. Where the concept of hypermedia is all way back the other direction, where you have to put some serious thought into your API design, before you ever roll up your sleeves to write code--big gap between these worlds.</p>
<p>J<a href="http://apiary.io">akub, Z, and the Apiary.io</a> team has done some amazing work to bring the mainstream conversation closer towards API design, much than hypermedia folks had ever done--until recently. What Luke asks, reflects the work we have left to bridge the divide, and emphasizes that it has to be something that scales. This is why Swagger was successful, because it provided the section of the bridge that API architects needed to solve an immediate problem that on the table, at scale--documentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is, the masses are pretty short-sighted, and often unwilling to the heavy learning and lifting needed to "code to link relationships, instead of hard-coded URLs". Unfortunately we will need more tooling to help us build more sections of the bridge (beyond Swagger), as we won't be able to it all at once. I think the important thing with this tooling, is we need make sure with each section of the bridge that we build, we are also educating API architects, and client developers around HTTP, media types, link relations, and other empowering hypermedia concepts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, Luke got me pumped with his questions. I do not know what the answers are either, but I want to lend a hand to help figuring it out, and will be asking these questions over and over in my head, showcase solutions that y'all are working on, and tell stories here on the blog, until we make some progress.</p>

<p>I'm neck deep in government open data again, and as we are gearing up for the presidential election, you really begin to see the potential for accurate, real-time election data via APIs. There are a number of leading election-related APIs at the federal level like we have from the&nbsp;<a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/api/">Sunlight Foundation</a>, and you see the emergence of high value APIs out of government like the&nbsp;<a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/07/08/openfec-api/">Federal Election Commision (FEC) API from the 18F</a>, but with the amount of money in politics, and scope of what is at stake, I can't help but feel there is a huge opportunity out there for more election APIs.</p>
<p>Seems to me that there is an opportunity for some API savvy activistpreneur to step up at the city, county, state, and even the federal level. I'm not just talking about election districts, candidate, and other common building blocks of elections we experience, but real-time sentiment, superpac spending, and other influential information that if availablle for distribution via APIs, could shift the balance one way or another. It would take a healthy assessment of the current landscape, but I think you could identify some low hanging fruit to get started with.</p>
<p>One you get going on the API journey around election data, if you do it right, you will learn a lot, and discover other valuable content or data sources, and see patterns that the rest of might not see. The use of social platforms over the last 8+ years of elections was all API driven, and is just the tip of the iceberg--an API dedicated to elections seems like a huge opportunity to me, in coming months and years.</p>
<p>Let's get to work!</p>

<p>I've always been a strong advocate for the API consumer, which is one of the primary motivations for me working to define best practices that API providers can follow across their operations. The majority of my negative experiences, when it comes to APIs, has been as an API consumer, not as an API provider.</p>
<p>As I do this API Evangelist thing longer, and longer, the bad behavior by API consumers becomes more clear to me, and I'd say rivaling much of the bad behavior by API providers that I have seen, and in some cases helping actually drive it. I do not have any bad actors in my API community, but through conversations I have had with leading API providers, I'm hearing some pretty crazy stories.</p>
<p>Badly behaved API consumers range from signing up for multiple accounts, rather than paying for higher levels of access, to trolling within the community, treating other developers badly, platform owners horribly, and just being a shitty API community citizen. You will never truly understand how badly API consumers can behave, until you've operated an API platform, and had a large number of consumers putting an API to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I will always keep my critical stance towards API providers, as I feel they often set the tone for a community, I am increasingly more understanding when platforms have to tighten things down, and get more critical when it comes to the public availability of API resources. In the end, I will always push for more public transparency around every aspect of API operations, but I am increasingly advising companies to have a tight grip on their API service composition, and what resources developers get access to, before they prove they are trustworthy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Nov 2015</span>
        <p>I recently told the story of how I view the API life-cycle, based upon my research across the space, at the <a href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag Conference in Broomfield, CO</a>, and at my <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in Austin, TX</a>. I spent two weeks pushing my research forward in preparation for these talks, and wanted to take a moment to gather my thoughts, and share the narrative of my talk.</p>
<p>When I first gave this title and abstract for both the Defrag and APIStrat keynotes, I called it "the 17 stops along a modern API lifecycle". After pushing my research forward, to support these talks, it became 26 stops, then those became what I am calling "lines", resulting in me just call the talk "the API life-cycle".</p>
<p>I use my public speaking as a vehicle for my API research, helping me polish my work, and ultimately pushing me to craft better narratives around my work, but most importantly, make it more coherent, and make sense to the average individual. One way that I do this, is to root my stories in history, build upon the earlier work in the tech space, and anchor them to other relevant areas of our everyday lives.</p>
<p>Everything I do as the API Evangelist is built on the hard work of men and women who came before me.</p>
<p>From the 1940s...</p>

<p>Getting us to the current decade, where I saw the potential of delivering the compute resources we needed for the mobile devices, that were quickly becoming ubiquitous in our daily personal as well as business lives. Designing, deploying, and managing APIs in support of mobile was the catalyst for my research as the API Evangelist in the summer of 2010.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/compute-2010s.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>As the API Evangelist, all that I do is map out what I am seeing across the API space, mapping out what API pioneers like Amazon and Salesforce are doing, as well as how recent API darlings like Twilio, SendGrid are executing on their API operations. I take this awareness, and map it against the services that leading API service providers are offering, in hopes of establishing a more coherent view of the overall API space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I conduct my research in hopes of helping API providers better understand how to establish a more successful strategy, but with a focus on being able to articulate this not just internally, but with developers, partners, and potentially the public at large. APIs are important. They are increasingly the pipes that are driving our personal, and professional worlds, and it is important that we do them as well as possible, so that they benefit everyone involved.</p>
<p>In 2015, I feel like I am the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Beck">Henry Beck of the API space</a>. If you aren't familiar with his work, he was one of the original minds behind a different way of thinking about mapping, designed for public transportation, that is still used today to describe major transit operations in cities around the globe.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/henry-beck.jpg" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p>In 1933, Henry Beck created a map of the London Underground, that was decoupled from earlier ways of mapping and communicating around transit resources, in a way that was focused on how the resources would be experienced by end-users, evolving beyond a focus on the transit resources themselves, and their location in our physical world.</p>
<p><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/clivebillson/tube/tube.html"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/Beck_Map_1933.jpg" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Earlier approaches to mapping out the subway reflected traditional mapping techniques, and were bound to legacy physical elements like roads, rivers, mountains, and buildings. While maps like this one from 1889, were technically accurate, they didn't always convey an increasingly complex subway system to end-users as they experienced it.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/1889small.jpg" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Even into the new century, subway maps were plotted along roads and rivers, leaving them coupled to legacy elements, and ways of thought,&nbsp; ignoring the fact that end-users of the subway were not thinking in these terms as they put the transit system to use. Riders just wanted to know how they needed to get where they were going, and not be burdened with these legacy elements they often do not even see.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/1902small.jpg" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>By 1915, public transit engineers like Henry Beck were rethinking how they mapped the transit infrastructure, in a way that helped them better communicate their increasingly complex infrastructure internally, but most importantly, in a way that helped them communicate externally to the public.</p>
<p>In 2015, this is what I feel like I am doing. Mapping out all the stops along the increasingly complex API life-cycle, in a way that helps API providers better understand their own life-cycle, but also like the subway map infrastructure, in a way that helps them communicate to consumers, and end-users.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/api-lifecycle-tag-cloud.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>At this point in my research, I am asking myself how&nbsp; I take the 26+ common areas of an API life-cycle and create standardized lines, that I could possibly be communicated in a common way, using the subway map analogy. As I approach the end of 2015, I have&nbsp;809 building blocks, in 149 categories, across these 26 common areas--I need a more universal approach to plotting these out, and the subway map is providing me with one possible way of doing this.</p>

<!-- End Generated---> <!-- Begin Layers 1-->
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem I am facing, is how do I properly map out these lines, in a way that reflect the role the play in an overall life-cycle? This is the difficult place I find myself currently, but will be working to solve using the subway map tools I am developing. They beauty of this analogy, is that I will be able to create multiple iterations over time, as well as be able to fork, and evolve maps for different platforms--similar to how multiple cities use the same subway map for their cities unique infrastructure.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-15.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<!--Begin Layer 2 -->
<p><br />Even once I find a rhyme and rhythm to mapping out the lines, stops, stations, and flows for my version of the API life-cycle, how will I do the same for the actual APIs themselves? I will need each API to follow a version of the API lifecycle, but also potentially possess its own, entirely separate journey, unique to a single API or potentially a stack of APIs.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-resources-15.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p><br />Eventually I envision a world where I don't just have my entire API life-cycle mapped out, as well the journey involved with each of my APIs, and the API collections I define, I want a real-time visualization for my entire infrastructure. I want to see where each API is on the API life-cycle, as well as see where each of my API consumers, and even API users are on their own journey.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/london_underground2-interactive.gif" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This might seem like a pretty tall order, but when you take a closer look at things, you realize that over 75% of the elements present in my API life-cycle definition, also has an API. <a href="http://3scale.net">My API management with 3Scale has an API</a>, and my <a href="http://apiscience.com">API monitoring with API Science has an API</a>. I'm increasingly choosing API service providers that have an API, because I need them to be a real-time contributor to my overall API lifecycle.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-15.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p><br />With my API infrastructure being API driven, I can now think of my API life-cycle subway map in API terms. I can dynamically plot out each API I operate as a journey, depicted as its own subway line, and also make sure each API interacts with its respective API life-cycle journey--all using APIs. *mind blown*</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-resources-15.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p><br />But wait there is more! It gets even better--it just so happens that <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/index.html">I also have an API for the subway map</a>. It is just an alpha version, but using this API, I can dynamically plot out the map of each area of my API life-cycle, as well as for each individual API, and its own journey on the life-cycle.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/Subway-Map-API.png" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>I'm not sure where all of this API life-cycle mapping will go. I'm hoping it will help me think through the API life-cycle, in the context of my overall API industry research, as well as my own APIs that I operate. I am hoping the process will help me decouple the way I approach my APIs from some of my legacy ways of thinking, built up over the last 25+ years a software architect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am hoping I will start to see my APIs in a new light, breaking away from thinking about them in a linear way, through the lens of the applications I build on top of them, as well as the resources they are developed from. I want my APIs to be decoupled from much of their legacy constraints, and reflect more how they will be consumed by developers, and experienced by end-users.</p>
<p>I am not under any illusions that this process will be easy, and it will probably take a great deal of time, and iterations, much like it did for early subway architects, when it came to mapping out early transit infrastructure.</p>

<p>Until finally, I'm hoping I will find a way to describe my own API life-cycle, and APIs, in a universal way, that could work for other API providers, and even API service providers. It took over 15 years of iterating on early London Underground maps, before they finally landed on this design in 1933.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/Beck_Map_1933.jpg" alt="" width="85%" /></p>
<p>Beck developed an approach to mapping transit infrastructure that would also work for defining complex transit infrastructure over almost a century later. The approach he helped define, is still applied as part of how we map out, as well as communicate transit infrastructure, around the globe in 2015. I hope I can apply some of the same principles to begin defining the virtual API infrastructure we are increasingly depending on in 2015.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/tubemap.gif" alt="" width="85%" /></p>
<p>While Ian Bogost was tweeting in jest about using a subway map for all written and visual communications, the tweet was very timely and relevant for me. It came across my Twitter timeline, just as I was crafting my subway map keynotes for Defrag and APIStrat. While I do not favor the subway approach for "all written and visual communications", I do think it has potential for "discursive synthesis" of the potentially complex API infrastructure that we are building in 2015.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/ian-bogost-twitter.png" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>Through my work, I am hoping to establish a sort of subway map line "toolbox" for communicating around the API life-cycle that I have spent the last five years defining. I am looking for this toolbox to give me a way of communicating&nbsp; and collaborating with others in a way that reflects common API industry approaches, while also being able to customize for specific platform needs.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-key.png" alt="" width="660" /></p>
<p>In addition to having a toolbox that reflects a modern API life-cycle, I am hoping the subway map approach gives me a set of tools I can use to visual the life-cycle of every individual API within my control. I desperately need a common way visualize my APIs, as well better understand where they exist within my overall API life-cycle.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-key-resources.png" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p>Having a common way to describe and communicate around transit infrastructure is critical to society operating, and the global economy. I feel pretty strongly that having a common way to describe and communicate around the API infrastructure we are increasingly depending on is just as critical&nbsp;critical to society operating, and the global (API) economy.</p>
<p>We need an approach that reflects how companies around the globe are already operating their APIs, acknowledging the value of existing successful patterns of interoperability, established by the Amazons and Twitters of the world, but also allows for the flexibility, customizablity, and unique needs of individual companies, and industries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The standardization, as well as uniqueness of what I'm talking about can be seen in the beautiful array of subway maps for major cities around the globe. These amazing maps meet the transit needs of each cities, while also embracing the principles laid out by early transit planners like Beck.</p>

<p>My storytelling at events like Defrag and APIStrat, as well as on my blog, always reflects where I am at with my research. Next I will be crafting more meaningful version of subway maps for each area of the API life-cycle, as well as an overall view showing all&nbsp;809 building blocks, in 149 categories, across the 26 areas I track on as part of my research.</p>
<p>I am anticipating that I will hit some areas where the subway map analogy fails me. I am already thinking about some ways of augmenting API specific elements on the approach, to help me better communicate specifically about API infrastructure. An example of where I'm bending this, is the concept that an individual API can have its own map, and line, as well as be a passenger on other lines--I just need to come up with a sort of wormhole station connector element that helps communicate this relationship and / or transition.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com">As always, you can find my research on the home page of API Evangelist</a>. As I complete subway maps for each of the 26 areas, as well as the overall map, I will make sure they are available as part of the navigation between each areas of my research. I am hoping to also use some JavaScript magic, in conjunction with the subway map analogy, to make navigating my research more of a journey, than just clicking around my site.</p>

<p>I just read <a href="https://medium.com/@TomSteinberg/the-pill-versus-the-bomb-what-digital-technologists-need-to-know-about-power-b1aede7facc9#.y28fb5vb6">The Pill versus the Bomb: What Digital Technologists Need to Know About Power</a>, by&nbsp;Tom Steinberg (<a href="https://twitter.com/steiny">@steiny</a>), and I'm reminded of the important role APIs will (hopefully) continue to play in helping provide a transparent window into some of the power structures being coded into the algorithms we are increasingly relying on in this digital world we are crafting.</p>
<p>In this century, we are seeing a huge shift in how power flows, and despite the rhetoric of some of the Silicon Valley believers, this power isn't always being democratized along the way. Much of the older power structures is just being re-inscribed into the algorithms that drive network switches, decide pricing when purchasing online, via our online banking, and virtually ever other aspect of our personal and business worlds.</p>
<p>APIs give us a window into how these algorithms work, providing access to 3rd party developers, government regulators, journalists, and many other essential actors across our society and economy. Don't get me wrong, APIs are no magic pill, or nuclear bomb, when it comes to making algorithmic power flows more transparent and equitable, but when they are done right, they can have a significant effect.</p>
<p>If APIs are a complete (or near complete) representation of the algorithms that are driving platforms, they can be used to better understand how decisions behind the algorithmic curtain are made, and exactly how power is flowing (or not) on web, mobile, and increasingly connected device platforms--API does not equal perfect transparency, but will help prevent all algorithms from being black boxes.</p>
<p>We may not fully understand Uber's business motivations, but through their API we can test our assumptions. We may not always trust Facebook's advertising algorithm, but using the API we can develop models for better understanding why they serve the ads they do. Drone operators may not always have the best intentions, but through mandatory device APIs, we can log flight times and locations. These are just a handful of examples that APIs can be used to map out digital power.</p>
<p>All of this is one of the main reasons that I do API Evangelist. I feel like we have a narrow window of opportunity to help ensure APIs act as this essential transparent layer for ALL API operations across industries. As the established power structures (eye of Sauron) turn their attention to the web, and increasingly APIs, their powers of transparency are becoming more diminished. It is up to us API Evangelists, to help make sure APIs stay publicly available to 3rd party developers, government, journalists, end users, and other key players--providing much needed transparency into how algorithms work, and how power is flowing on the web and mobile Internet.</p>

<p>It can be easy to stumble across the base URL for one of my APIs out on the open Internet. I design my APIs to be easily distributed, shared, and as accessible as possible--based upon what I feel the needs for the resource might be. You can find most of my APIs, as part of my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">master stack</a>, but there are other APIs like my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/screen-capture/">screen capture API</a>, or maybe my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/screen-capture/">image manipulation API</a>, that are often orphaned, which I know some people could use some help identifying more of the resources that are behind API operations.</p>
<p>To help support discovery across my network of APIs, I'm going to be supporting requests for Content-Type: application/apis+json for each endpoint, as well as an <a href="http://apisjson.org">apis.json file</a> in the root of the API, and supporting portal. An example of this in action, can be seen with my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/blog/">blog API</a>, where you can look into the root of the portal for API (<a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/blog/apis.json">kin-lane.github.io/blog/apis.json</a>), and in the root of the base URL for the API (<a href="http://blog.api.kinlane.com/apis.json">blog.api.kinlane.com/apis.json</a>), and for each individual endpoint, like the (<a href="http://blog.api.kinlane.com/blog/">blog.api.kinlane.com/blog/</a>) endpoint, you can request the&nbsp;Content-Type:&nbsp;application/apis+json, and get a view of the APIs.json discovery file.</p>
<p>It will take me a while to this rolled out across all of my APIs, I have worked out the details on my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/blog/">blog</a>, and <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/">API</a> APIs. Providing discovery at the portal, API, and endpoint level just works. It provides not just access to documentation, but the other critical aspects of API operations, in a machine readable way, wherever you need it. It is nice to be on the road to having APIs.json exist as the media type (application/apis+json), something that isn't formal yet, but we are getting much closer with the latest release, and planned releases.</p>
<p>Next, I will push out across all my APIs, and do another story to capture what things look at that point. Hopefully it is something I can encourage others to do eventually, making API discovery a little more ubiquitous across API operations.</p>

<p>I am back home in Los Angeles, after another great edition of <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice--this time in Austin, TX</a>. I have had a few day to decompress, and took a day to reboot my brain by <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/23/sharing-235k-api-definitions-with-the-english-language-api-recipe-book/">crafting 235K+ API definitions for the English language</a>, resulting in some time to reflect on what happened last week in Austin.</p>
<p>First of all I want to thank <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>. Without the API infrastructure provider, APIStrat would not happen. Second I want to <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/sponsors/">thank all the sponsor s who get involved</a>, without your support the conversation wouldn't happen. Third, I want to thank the speakers and attendees for making it such a meaningful conversation.</p>
<p>I tend to use that word, "conversation" a lot when describing APIStrat, but I feel pretty strongly that it is the conversation that occurs at APIStrat that helps move the entire API community in a very meaningful way. The conference always renews my energy, and strengthens my relationships with other important folks in the space that I rely on for my research and storytelling.</p>
<p>Thank you so much to everyone who came to Austin last week and participated, and special thanks to Steve and the 3Scale team for investing so much into the API community, while asking for so little in return.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Nov 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-copyright.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I needed a side project to reboot my mind after @APIStrat this last weekend, so I opened up my notebook and picked a project that I've been meaning to give some attention to, one that would help me clean my slate, and let me get back to my regular work levels. The project I picked is one that I came up with a little over a year ago, but recently had flushed out my vision further, as I hung out at my favorite watering whole drinking an IPA.</p>
<p>It took me several iterations before I landed on a name for this project, but my working title is <a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/">the English Language API Recipe Book</a>. I find myself in an awkward position these days, when it comes to the concept of API copyright, which is something I have taken a firm stance on with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/22/what-we-can-do-to-make-a-difference-in-the-wake-of-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-case/">my work around the Oracle v Google ava API copyright case</a>, and the release of the <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API licensing format API Commons</a>, but is something, in the end, I just do not believe in.</p>
<p>You see, in my opinion, API definitions should NOT fall under copyright. Like recipes and menus, API definitions should not be open for anyone to use. To help me make my point, I wanted to craft <a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/">the English Language API Recipe Book</a>, publishing an open API definition for almost every word in the English dictionary. I found a reasonably complete list of every English word, and auto-generated an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">Open API Definition Format (OADF)</a> specification for each of the 235K+ words.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each API definition, I cover the base GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs for each word, providing a basic query via a parameter, and return a name, and description as the basic underlying data model. I am already playing with other variations of database models, and have also generated another dimension for each word, by again iterating through each word, and adding it as a secondary level resource. I am also playing with other relationships, and ideas for expanding the dimensions of this recipe book, but wanted to get this first version out the door.</p>
<p><a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/english-language-dictionary-notes.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Overall, I just want to show how easy it is to programmatically generate API definitions, and add this English Language API Recipe Book to my already growing number of API definitions, <a href="http://theapistack.com">from popular APIs that I include in the API Stack</a>. Through this work, I wanted to emphasize, that no matter how much work you put into the naming, ordering, and design of your API definitions, they are not creative works that you should lock up and defend--your API definitions should be open, easily accessible, shared, and designed for reuse.</p>
<p>While I do not think any of the 235K+ API definitions should have copyright applied, I will putting all of these into public domain, using a Creative Commons license, as act two of this production. This is more theater than anything, but using API Commons, I will make sure every word in the English dictionary, crafted as a basic web API, is available for anyone to use, anytime, anywhere (as it should be, DUH). I recently stated in a keynote, after launching API Commons, that I was going to be the "Johnny Fucking Appleseed" of publishing openly licensed API definitions, out in front of slower moving corporations like Oracle--the English Language API Recipe Book is just the beginning of this.</p>
<p>Next up, I will be crafting a series of OADF API definitions for <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a> and use <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> to bundles as a more meaningful collection. I will be using these data models to further automate the English Language API Recipe Book, and establish additional dimensions to this collection. <a href="https://github.com/english-language-api-recipe-book">You can find the English Language API Recipe Book on Github</a>. I have published as a Github organization, with a separate sharded repository for each letter of the alphabet, containing a separate OADF definition for each word in the dictionary, and indexed using APIs.json to index each letter, <a href="http://english-language-api-recipe-book.github.io/master/apis.json">as well as for the overall recipe book collection</a>--making it all machine readable by default.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Nov 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-licensing-stack.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/22/what-we-can-do-to-make-a-difference-in-the-wake-of-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-case/">I've spent a lot of time thinking through the licensing we apply to APIs, as part of my work on the Oracle v Google API copyright case</a>. The licensing around APIs is still in flux, with the current precedent being that APIs are copyrightable. Even though I do not believe this stance, I encourage API designers to make sure and apply one of the more liberal Creative Commons licenses to your API definitions, taking a pre-emptive stance in the conversation.</p>
<p>In my experience most API providers, let alone consumers and the public at large, do not understand the separation between an APIs definition, and the code that runs the API, and often even the code that consumes an API. To help us visualize the separation, as well as think through the licensing implications of each layer, <a href="http://licensing.apievangelist.com/">I have setup a specific research project that addresses API licensing</a>, in hopes of spending time regularly researching the topic, as well as telling stories that help people navigate how to license their APIs.</p>
<p>Here is how I'd break down the five most common layers of the API licensing stack, and some ideas for how you can apply licenses to these layers of API operations.</p>
<p><strong>Server Code -</strong>&nbsp;For many APIs, your server code will be your secret sauce and kept proprietary, but for those of you who wish to open source this critical layer, here are some options. To help you navigate the licensing, I recommend using&nbsp;<a href="http://choosealicense.com/">Github's Choose a License</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache</a></strong>&nbsp;- The Apache License is a free software license written by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). The Apache License requires preservation of the copyright notice and disclaimer.

<li><strong><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GPL</a></strong>&nbsp;- The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL) is the most widely used[6] free software license, which guarantees end users (individuals, organizations, companies) the freedoms to run, study, share (copy), and modify the software. Software that allows these rights is called free software and, if the software is copylefted, requires those rights to be retained.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a></strong>&nbsp;- The MIT License is a free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It is a permissive free software license, meaning that it permits reuse within proprietary software provided all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data&nbsp;</strong>- Serving up data is one of the most common reasons for deploying an API, and the&nbsp;<a href="http://opendatacommons.org/">Open Data Commons</a>, provides us with some licensing options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/">Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)</a></strong> &mdash; The PDDL places the data(base) in the public domain (waiving all rights).</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/">Attribution License (ODC-By)</a></strong> &mdash; You are free to share, create, and adapt, as long as you attribute the data source.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Content -</strong>&nbsp;Separate from the data, APIs are being used to server up short, and long form content, where liberal&nbsp;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Common</a>&nbsp;licenses should be considered.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a></strong>&nbsp;- This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0">CC BY-SA</a>&nbsp;-</strong>&nbsp;This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to copyleft free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a></strong>&nbsp;- Use this universal tool if you are a holder of copyright or database rights, and you wish to waive all your interests in your work worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>API Definition -&nbsp;</strong>The part of the discussion be defined (unfortunately) by the Oracle v Google Java API copyright legal battle, and in light of the ruling, I urge you to consider one of the more liberal&nbsp;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Common</a>&nbsp;licenses.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a></strong>&nbsp;- This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Client Code -</strong>&nbsp;Separate from your server side code, you should make sure all of your client side code SDKs, PDKs, and starter kits have an open source license applied-o-remember you are asking them to potentially integrate this into their business operations. Again&nbsp;I recommend using&nbsp;<a href="http://choosealicense.com/">Github's Choose a License</a>&nbsp;to help you navigate this decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache</a></strong>&nbsp;- The Apache License is a free software license written by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).

</ul>
<p>This list does not reflect all of the licensing opportunities available to you. These reflect the licensing options that I recommend you consider, as part of your API operations. I want as many APIs to thoughtfully consider the licensing for their entire API stack, and I'm kick-starting these research to provide a short, concise guide for API providers to consider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I get my way, every layer of the API stack will be licensed as openly as possible, however I add some extra concern for the <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition layer</a>. I know many of my readers will argue that this is just code, and should be licensed along side your server side code, but this is not true-modern API definitions are increasingly available as JSON, YAML, Markdown, that is telling a very important story that is having a significant impact on how we do business, and live our personal lives--a story that should be able to retold and echoed across the digital landscape, without licensing restrictions.</p>
<p><a href="http://licensing.apievangelist.com/">My API licensing research</a> is just getting going. I will be rounding it off with examples of the approach used by leading API providers, news and stories I curated from across the space, as well as more&nbsp;<a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>&nbsp;tooling that helps you define the licensing for your API, and share in a machine readable way.</p>

<p>I wish I had more time to spend on designing, and deploying APIs the way I desired. Without any real funding of individual APIs, I can only go so far with them, which usually doesn't go beyond the minimal viable API. However, even with this reality, I have two APIs I would love to see done right, and keep nagging at me.</p>
<p>One API is my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/curated/">curated news API</a>, which I currently have a pretty bare bones JSON definition to represent each news article I curate from the API space (date, title, author, body, url). As I have time, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/11/applying-a-little-hypermedia-is-helping-me-tighten-down-my-api-design-and-tell-a-better-api-story/">I've been trying to craft a Siren representation of this same resource</a>. The opportunities for exploration of my archive of curated API news going back to 2011 is pretty huge (in my opinion).</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/audio/">I've also been having delusions of a hypermedia enabled version of my audio API</a>, which I use store audio files I find, create, or publish. It is a CRUD version of what I'd like to see, but recently I've been thinking of ways I could craft a more audible version of API Evangelist, but in order to do it right, I need a hypermedia enabled API experience.</p>
<p>For me, ,this takes hypermedia beyond many of the discussions I have been exposed to, moving my motivations into the realm of user experience, and not about building a client that will rule them all, or just as a matter of principle--I just want to deliver the right experience. How do I allow consumers of my audio API to define their own experience? How do I craft some experiences, based upon my view of the API space--as I see the world?</p>
<p>This is where hypermedia goes beyond the technical, and moves into the experiential realm where I'm hoping that I can manifest some more money to pay for tehse API designs to become a reality. ;-) Thank you for your support!</p>

<p>When I started API Evangelist in 2010, I tracked on one area--API management. Over the years this expanding to be about API deploy, and design, and most recently monitoring and discovery. As I approach the end of 2015, I've expanding this to be 30 separate areas of research.</p>
<p>I have almost 200 projects I'm pushing forward in one way or another, but these 30 years reflect the API space I am working so hard to make sense of in 2015. While all of my research is a work in progress, I have these core projects as part of my regular monitoring, and I will be updating as much as possible.</p>

<p>While this may seem like a lot of areas to keep track of, I'm finding it easier and easier to do, as it all continues to come into focus for me. I also have other research areas I'd like to merge in here, and maybe some other areas I'd like to to migrate out of existing research, into new areas.</p>
<p>As I'm preparing for my keynotes at Defrag in Colorado, and APIStrat in Austin this month, I'm refreshing all of my research, and trying to use my work to craft a hopefully interesting talk, while also sharing some nuggets of wisdom from the vantage point I enjoy.</p>
<p>All of my research is licensed CC-BY, is machine readable by default, and runs on Github, so if you have any questions you can submit an issue, or ping me directly. If you are feeling adventurous you are also welcome to fork any of my work and incorporate it with your own work, or even submit a pull request and contribute your own thoughts to my research.</p>
<p>As always you can find <a href="http://apievangelist.com">this working list of research on my the home page of API Evangelist</a>--thanks for tuning in!</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Nov 2015</span>

<p>I read a lot of blog posts, and press releases about open data these days, and when I find a dataset I think offers a lot of value, or is just interesting enough to help push forward, I either try to incorporate into my <a href="http://adopta.agency/">Adopta open data work</a>, or I just put it out to my followers to see if anyone can help.</p>
<p>As I was monitoring the space yesterday I came across the&nbsp;<a href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/">Ranking Digital Rights 2015 Corporate Accountability Index</a>, which <em>"evaluates 16 of the world&rsquo;s most powerful Internet and telecommunications companies on their disclosed commitments, policies, and practices that affect users&rsquo; freedom of expression and privacy."</em>--<a href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2015/download/">I saw there was an excel and CSV versions of the report</a>, but I didn't see an API, so I tweeted out:</p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>

<p>Victor Olex (<a href="https://twitter.com/agilevic">@agilevic</a>) from <a href="http://www.slashdb.com/">SlashDB</a>, turned around an API endpoint in a matter of a couple of hours. Here is what Victor sent me:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span class="s1">I took your Twitter challenge and created the API for Ranking Digital Rights data. The data model does not include scores for individual lines of business, but it does have all qualitative data needed to make sense of it.

<p>These are very resource oriented API endpoints, meaning they look like the raw resource they are generated from, but it demonstrates the value of using cloud services like SlashDB to do a lot of the heavy lifting for you when deploying an API. Getting an API up and running, so that you can start building web, mobile, data visualizations, and other tooling is an important first step--then you can also start iterating on, and begin the process of defining the next generation endpoints.</p>
<p>As you can see the SlashDB interface allows me to dill down using the URL, referencing the databases, relationships, and other resources that are exposed. What I like about SlashDB, is it lets you navigate the resources and relationships through the generated HTML pages, and then retrieve the XML or JSON you will need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next steps for me, is I'd like to craft a simple Github Pages hosted landing page, and define a base set of meaningful API endpoints that would allow potential API consumers to quickly understand what is contained in the the&nbsp;<a href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/">Ranking Digital Rights 2015 Corporate Accountability Index</a>, and hopefully incentivize someone building something cool on top of it.</p>
<p>Thanks to&nbsp;Victor Olex (<a href="https://twitter.com/agilevic">@agilevic</a>) and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slashdb.com/">SlashDB</a>&nbsp;more doing this important work--you guys rock!!</p>

<p>I am a big advocate for making sure the on-boarding process for developers is as friction-less as possible. Developers should be able to signup, and login without anything getting in their way. This is why normally I wouldn't suggest adding anything unnecessary to to signup and login process, but <a href="https://console.cloud-elements.com/elements/jsp/login.jsp">I saw something over at Cloud Elements that I thought was interesting</a>.</p>
<p>First, let me know that Cloud Elements gets bonus points because they <a href="https://console.cloud-elements.com/elements/jsp/login.jsp">emphasize signing in with your Github or Google account.</a> I am a big fan of keeping all my API accounts linked to my Github profile--it just makes sense to me. I'd love it if API providers allowed me to store keys, SDKs, and other resources within my private Github repository, that I use across all the APIs I depend on. (I'm sure someone will tell me not to do this, but nobody has yet to convince me of why)</p>
<p><a href="https://console.cloud-elements.com/elements/jsp/login.jsp">What really caught my eye logging in,</a> was the updates they provided at the bottom of the login screen. There was an image, with a simple message telling me that v1 of the Cloud Elements API was sunsetting, with a simple "Read More" link, so I can get more details. I like this concept of adding these type of critical updates to the login screen for developers.</p>
<p>I am going to add a flexible messaging area to signup and login screen, as part of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">my suggested on-boarding building blocks</a>. Developers may not be regularly logging into their API developer portals, so I wouldn't depend on this channel for everything, but in addition to the blog, Twitter, and other channels, it might make sense as a way to share important information with API consumers.</p>

<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">I've had a handful of suggested building blocks when it comes to authentication, as part of my API management research</a>, but after taking a look at the <a href="https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-scopes">OAuth Scopes page for the Slack API</a>, I'm going to add another building block just for listing out OAuth scopes.</p>
<p>For platforms who provide OAuth, scopes are how access to users content and data is being broken down, and negotiated. When it comes to industry levels, OAuth scopes are how power and influence is being brokered, so I'm going to start tracking on how leading providers are defining their scopes--I am sure there are some healthy patterns that we all can follow here.</p>
<p><a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/14/the-future-of-public-private-sector-partnerships-being-negotiated-at-the-api-oauth-scope-level/">I have had the pleasure of sitting in on OAuth negotiations between major utility providers, as part of my work with the White House and Department of Energy</a>&nbsp;in the past.&nbsp;This work has given me a glimpse into the future of how access and sharing of data will be negotiated in the future, with OAuth scopes and APIs playing a central role.</p>
<p>It will take me some time to standardize how I gather, store, and publish the OAuth scopes for each API, but I can get started by bookmarking any provider who shares their OAuth scopes, and encourage other API providers to do, by suggesting a formal OAuth scopes page as one possible building block you should consider when crafting your API strategy.</p>

<p><a href="http://apimetrics.io/2015/11/03/apimetrics-second-api-performance-report-social-networks/">APImetrics just released their second API Performance Report for Social Networks</a>, aggregated from data they have been gathering from monitoring social networks since 2014. APImetrics is publishing the report to "..understand the impact these APIs were having on social media based on geographic location and specific cloud service provider."</p>
<p>I'll let you read the report yourself, I just wanted to highlight the importance of this type of API monitoring from 3rd party services like APImetrics. The other providers I watch closely like <a href="http://apis.how/8nlsropidv">Runscope</a> and <a href="http://apis.how/h1h2mnxnc4">API Science</a> also monitor 3rd party APIs like this, but I think publishing formal reports on a regular basis like APImetrics is doing, is healthy for the space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually, I would like to see an aggregate location where all API monitoring service providers can publish their data, in a common format, and the larger API community could process, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/31/how-are-we-going-to-create-the-standard-and-poors-and-moodys-for-the-api-economy/">help establish an API rating solution that we can all take advantage of</a>. Historical, and real-time data will be key to establishing the open rating system that we need.</p>
<p>I would say that social, cloud, and messaging apps kind top the list of APIs we should be monitoring and rating, but eventually it would be nice to have this be commonplace for any public API in the space. Part of helping us evolve the <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a> conversation, is establishing a baseline for rating the good APIs from the bad ones, and work like the social network report from APImetrics helps us get closer to this possible future.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/27/api-monitoring-should-be-baked-into-your-api-strategy-by-default/">I love that AWS is baking monitoring testing by default in the new Amazon API Gateway</a>. I am also seeing new service from AWS, and Google providing security and testing services for your APIs, and other infrastructure. It just makes sense for cloud platforms to incentivize security of their platforms, but also ensure wider success through the performance and load testing of APIs as well.</p>
<p>As I'm reading through recent releases, and posts, I'm thinking about the growth in <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">monitoring</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">testing</a>, and <a href="http://performance.apievangelist.com">performance</a> services targeting APIs, and the convergence with a growth in the number of approaches to API <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">virtualization</a>, and what <a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com">containers</a> are doing to the API space. I feel like Amazon baking in monitoring and testing into API deployment and management because it is in their best interest, but is also something I think providers could go even further when it comes to investment in this area.</p>
<p>What if you could establish a stage of your operations, such as QA, or maybe production testing, and the compute and bandwidth costs associated with operations in these stages were significantly discounted? Kind of like the difference in storage levels between Amazon S3 and Glacier, but designed specifically to encourage monitoring, testing, and performance on API deployments.</p>
<p>Maybe AWS is already doing this and I've missed it. Regardless it seems like an interesting way that any API service provider could encourage customers to deliver better quality APIs, as well as help give a boost to the overall API testing, monitoring, and performance layer of the sector. #JustAThought</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Nov 2015</span>

<p><span>When planning the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference, the team works very hard to make the speaker and session line up reflect what we see across the API space. The conference is meant to be an open, non-vendor and non-product focus, discussion about what individuals and companies are facing when it comes to being API providers, as well as API consumers.</span></p>
<p><span>When we closed the call for papers for APIStrat this year, it was clear that API consumption would be one of the sessions, but &nbsp;as we progressed in the process of locking down talks it was clear that API consumption should be something that we should move to the main stage. To help highlight the importance of this discussion, I wanted to ask Mark Boyd (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/mgboydcom"><span>@mgboydcom</span></a><span>), the conference chair for APIStrat his thoughts on why we did this:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>This year has seen two major API consumption challenges: For API providers looking to continue their growth, 2015 has often been about putting their API in front of non-dev users and making their API accessible to a wider audience. We're seeing an increasing use of tools like Google Sheets and slackbot integrations trying to make API functionality available to people who don't code. For businesses and enterprises generally, the increasing use of external APIs has meant more challenges for dev teams in aggregating APIs and using multiple APIs consistently. Each API they are using might come with different terms of service, differing rate limits, different terminology for the same subject matter, and different ways of measuring units. For example, most API consumers I hear from are frustrated that each API they use seems to have a different way of measuring and displaying time formats!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr"><em>As APIs keep growing in mainstream business use, there becomes a tipping point in scaling the API economy where it starts adding complexity rather than removing it. We think that 2015 is that tipping point and we need to start solving how end users can consume APIs without it creating new challenges for them. We've got some of the best minds who are thinking through how to solve these issues - Mark Geene from Cloud Elements, Paul Katsen from Blockspring, Taylor Barnett from Keen IO, Kirsten Hunter from Akamai, Noam Schwartz from Similar Web, and Todd Sundsted from SumAll have all navigated their way through making their APIs accessible to others or building an abstraction layer so that all the APIs they are consuming are working in unison. This will be a great panel session for API providers who want to make it easier for their developer community to consume their APIs, and great for API consumers to learn some of the tools and tricks that can make it easier to integrate external APIs into their own work.</em></p>
<p>I think Mark nails it. For me, this session moving to the main stage demonstrates that APIs are going mainstream, as more, and more of the "normals" are tuning into the API conversation. <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/schedule/">The API consumption panel at APIStrat this month includes</a>:</p>

<p><span>All of these panel participants are API providers, service providers, as well as consumers -- making for a pretty potent discussion about APIs. These companies are all very aware of the challenges API consumers face, because they are doing it at scale. If you are an API provider looking for the best advice on how to streamline use of your API, these are the people you want to tune into.</span></p>
<p>As part of the storytelling around @APIStrat, I will be digging deeper into each of these companies, and profiling what they contribute to the API space. APIStrat is a little over two weeks away,<a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/registration/"> so make sure you are registered</a>, before all the tickets are sold--<a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/schedule/">take a look at the schedule</a>, and make sure you are main stage to listen to Mark, Paul, Taylor, Kirsten, Todd, and Noam discuss API consumption in Austin.</p>

<p>Many of you that have attended any of my talks, have heard me tell the audience about the importance of sharing your API stories. As an API provider it is the most important tool in your toolbox, above and beyond any technical or business advantage you have. I'm spending more time lately, gathering up the things I say over and over in my talks, and other in-person conversations, and craft simple stories that echo these little nuggets of wisdom on the blog.</p>
<p>If you do not tell the story of what your API is doing, nobody will know--it really is that simple. The drumbeat from your blog, should echo the activity that is going on via your API. Your day might be filled with a hectic stack of activity from your view, but your API consumers, analysts, and storytellers like me, we do not see any of this activity, and we all need to hear about your day on your blog, amplified by your active Twitter account.</p>
<p>I can tell you that the APIs who are doing interesting things, and are telling the story of these things, end up on my blog, and in the major tech blogosphere much more often, than those that do not. I'm not telling you to craft amazing essays about your operations, I'm just asking that you blog daily, or every couple days, on the often mundane, but potentially highly valuable stories from the trenches of your API operations--it is something that, the more you do, the easier it wil gets.</p>
<p>While the goal of blogging is to communicate externally with your API consumers, and the public at large, my secondary motive is to expose you to a very beneficial by-product of blogging in this way. When you get into a rhythm where you are working through your ideas, operations, and API road-map, in such a public way, you develop a very different view of your platform, one that is closer aligned with your community, and potentially the industry you are looking to play a role in.</p>
<p>I want you to share your API stories, but more importantly I want your API to be successful, and regular telling stories to your community, and the public, will increase these odds significantly in my experience.</p>

<p>As I explore through API portals, looking for the successful approaches to APIs, I'm increasingly seeing formal partner programs, <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/index.html">resulting in me expanding the topic as its own research area</a>. My objective is to keep track of how the APIs I track on operate their partner programs, resulting in the list of organizations I reference in my research. I also want to try and identify what some of the common building blocks of API partner programs are, in addition to the news stories that I have curated about partnerships--which is the fuel of my research.</p>
<p>I have recorded 31 separate partner programs, which I found through the course of my API monitoring and research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are all companies who have formal partner efforts that provide a higher level of access to their API. There are many companies who feel their developer programs is a partner program, but what I am looking for is a partner program that looks to certify developers, and give them more benefits through deeper participation with a platform.</p>
<p>After looking through these companies I've recorded a handful of what I'd consider to be some of the common building blocks of these API partner programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is just a start, after I spend more time looking through these programs, and learning more, I will evolve further. As I do with my other areas of research I will publish all of this as a white paper when I can. You can stay in tune with the <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/news/">API partner related news I find on the research site under news</a>, the <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/companies.html">official company partner programs I've flagged under organizations</a>, and <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">the common elements I have recorded under building blocks</a>--it will change as I have time, so check back regularly.</p>
<p>Next, I think I will look at the types of partnerships that these platforms are offering, and study the relationship between their partner programs, and their general API access. If I can, I will also track on which partners are showcased as part of each program, to try and get a vibe for which companies are working hard at establishing partnerships across the space. There is quite a bit of curated news to still go through and make sense of all the partner related activity I have been coming across for the last couple years. It is always hard to get my research up to speed with how much information I have curated over time, and the more I research, the more information I seem to collect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you know of any partner programs I don't have listed, feel free to let me know.</p>

<p>I have a notebook of story ideas I can do from any moment, but I find that I foten need some sort of inspiration to kick them off properly. I got that this afternoon in a Tweet from Leah Bannon, reminding me how important it is for me to have stories for non-developers.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Tools that make it easier for non-devs to do stuff with APIs are the most under appreciated and awesome things in tech right now imho</p>
&mdash; Leah Bannon (@leahbannon) <a href="https://twitter.com/leahbannon/status/661340438377463808">November 3, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>There are many tools available right now that let's anyone publish an API, you just have to know the right tools, and right process to get the results you need. Thanks to Zapier, <a href="http://apis.how/mqashcq6gb">you can connect to the API driven services of a wide variety of cloud tools, and using Google Spreadsheets and Zapier</a>, you can easily store data and content, to be used in a simple API--all without writing any code.</p>
<p>The most useful example of this, is using popular form services like <a href="http://apis.how/dp1jeyo2dm">Wufoo</a>, <a href="http://apis.how/a6shmgr13k">Gravity Forms</a>, <a href="http://apis.how/hatabecuhu">Typeform</a>, and <a href="http://apis.how/cxz1whvjh7">Survey Monkey</a>, you can collect just about any information you want, crafting exactly the form and fields you want, then using Zapier you can route the form results to a Google Spreadsheet. Once you have your Google Spreadsheet, <a href="http://apis.how/5ytnitnakm">you can then easily publish an API, complete with documentation using Restlet's cloud API deployment, and management services</a>.</p>
<p>I'm going to save the detailed how-to for a future post, but I wanted to kick-start, what I hope to be an ongoing series, of simple exmaples of how non-developers can consume and publish their own APIs, without being a programmer. My goal is to help encourage anyone to understand the value of aggregating valuable data and content using Google Sheets, and then allowing it to be put to use anywhere, by deploying an API with Restlet.</p>
<p>If you need help with this example, let me know and I will expedite my next how-to post.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-plan.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have some really amazing resources exposed as APIs. Everyone is doing it these days, and I have some good ones, now I just need a plan. You know, actually, I need several plans, that will help me expose these resources to the right people, while remain as much control as I need, and also generate revenue from these resources, tailored to whoever I am offering them to.</p>
<p><strong>Starting With The Essential API Building Blocks</strong><br />I want to allow anyone to access my valuable APIs, however I want to control exactly how much they can access, and even limit it to a free trial, and a small amount of calls upon the API. I am going to call this Plan A, also known as my freemium layer, meant to just wet the appetite of any potential API consumer. I ow have a basic level of access to my API resources, that anyone can sign up for 24/7, yet I get to dictate exactly how many hits on the API they can make, and who gets access.</p>
<p><strong>Moving Beyond Plan A For My API Strategy</strong><br />Plan A only gets me so far, I need to also be able to establish additional plans that help me cover the costs of my operations, and hopefully also generate some revenue from API access and usage. I need to be able to establish any number of plans that I will need to be successful. Each additional plan that I offer, lets call them plan B, C, and D, should have the ability to sign-up 24/7 without approval, possess a trial version option if necessary, and allow for charging of setup costs to get going--if I so choose.</p>
<p><strong>Defining Usage Metrics That Are Meaningful To Me</strong><br />All of my plans will start with these elements, but then should allow me to set any other metric I desire. I want to track on API call, by message, according to bandwidth consumed or stored, the time period in play, the scope of compute being applied, and much, much more. Any of my plans should be able to to measured in these units, or anything else I want to define. If an API plan provides access to a blog, product catalog, the requirements might be different than when I provide access to images, videos, podcasts or other heavy objects. I should be able to define the metrics, and set a price per metric that can be applied to each APIs I am making available.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing Limitations For API Access</strong><br />Each of my plans should have well defined units of operations (metrics), cost per unit, and volume pricing, but also should possess limitations of what can be accessed. I need to restrict some plans to a daily amount, limit server loads by only allowing a certain amount of requests, bandwidth, per second, minute, hour, day, week, or month. If I want, I should be able to leave API access open ended. How I define the access for each of my API plans, should be tailored exactly for my intended audience for each plan, with an infinite number of plans possible.</p>
<p><strong>Which APIs Methods Are Available In Each Of My Plan(s)</strong><br />No plans are created equal. Which API resources, and methods, and verbs, are available in any given plan is again, tailored to the intended audience of each plan. My Plan A allows limited reading from just a handful of resources for everyone, while my Plan C allows for reading and writing from a variety of API resources, designed for a specific group of partners, defined by me. My public facing plans encourage consumption of specific resources that I have crafted, while my partner plans encourage two way usage, incentivizing my partners to add, update, and curate information available via the API resources I have made available.</p>
<p><strong>All The Variables I Need To Compose The Plans I Need</strong><br />I can create as many APIs, and individual methods, and package them up into plans, and measure their access by call, bandwidth, storage, time period, compute, and other critical metrics. It is within my control to set limitations, and volume levels of access across these metrics, charging exactly what I need to incentivize API usage, while also covering the costs of my operations, and bring in a healthy bit of revenue in the door as well--I have a full toolbox of what I need to orchestrate my API driven business model(s).</p>
<p><strong>Provide The Features My Consumers Will Need Along With Each Plan</strong><br />Along with the access of API resources within each plan, I need to also bundle other features, like support, service level agreement (SLA), and other resources that consumers will need to be successful with integrations. Again, each plan should be tailored for the intended audience, providing the API access they need, while also makes sure all their adjacent needs are met along the way as well.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-conductor.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Providing Variable Unit(s) of Value For All API Transactions</strong><br />Whether its an API call, bandwidth transmitted, or duration of resource usage, you have measurable units of value, where a price can be set, in a way that lets it be adjusted by volume, or each plan level. An API call might be one cent (for sake of discussion), but if you access more than 10K per day, it goes down to half a cent per API call. For partner plans, each API call might be 1/10th of a cent by default, with 1/100th of a cent if you access more than 10K per day. Each API has its unit of value, with the price for this unit of value variable depending which plan you are in, and how much you consume.</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Know What Price To Set For Each Unit Of Access?</strong><br />You have an API, but where do you even start understanding where to price this resource, which you feel is really cool and valuable, but might be completely meaningless to others. You can start by looking at competing API providers, and follow any precedent that has been set in the industry to date. Beyond following the lead of others, you can break down your own story, and dial in exactly what it costs to deliver an API, and set the price for the industry, and lead others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What Did Cost To Acquire What Is Need For An API Resources?</strong><br />Every API starts somewhere. What did it take to discover the idea for an API, negotiate or license its usage, or maybe you had to purchase some content, data, or access to a programmatic resources. Before you get to work developing an API, there will be some investment to bring an API idea to production.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What Has Gone Into Developing An API?</strong><br />Beyond the acquisition of an API, like the API usage itself, this might be a two way street, it might not just be costs associated, but also investment from other partners, investors, or otherwise. What has gone into normalizing resources, designing and developing the database, server, and the API itself. Consider the network too--what will it take when it comes to network bandwidth, and what are the DNS considerations to manage traffic. Thanks to cloud computing, there are many ways to meter areas like compute, storage, and bandwidth, make sure and put these tools to work for you.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What Are The Realities Of What It Will Cost To Operate An API?</strong><br />What are the costs associated with maintaining the central truth of an API, its definition? What are the hard compute, storage, and bandwidth costs associated with API operations? I'm sure you have a good handle on what these are. How much do you have invested in management, monitoring, security, and evangelism? There are a lot of costs to consider beyond the visible aspects of API operations, but there are also a lot of associated costs to operations that often get left behind like support, and the creation of additional resources.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Let's Discuss Who Will Be Access An API And Our Plan For Different Levels&nbsp;</strong><br />Now we have a better handle of what goes into acquiring, developing, and operating an API, but who actually be accessing the API, and who do we need to offer different plans to, tailored for their relationship with me, and their unique needs. We have discussed the opportunities around free, and free trial access plans, but what about other pro bono approaches like not-for-profit, and educational or research plans, to help eliminate costs for consumers, and encouraging meaningful access.</p>
<p class="p1">Once we have establish the entry levels of access we can begin crafting additional levels of retail, partner, or internal levels of API access. It doesn't need to stop there, you can craft as many plans for API access as needed to meet the needs of every potential group, inside or outside of a company. API providers should work to be as transparent as possible with available plans, and what is available within each plan level, all the way up to partner tiers and potentially reseller or private label tiers of access.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Now That We Have A Better Understand Of What Goes Into Our APIs, How Do We Set Pricing?</strong><br />Even though we know what went into an API, we don't always know how API consumers will perceive the value around an API, so we must be ready to adjust pricing based upon this perception. How we limit, and incentivize usage needs to reflect this value, and the relationship with each group of consumers. There should be paths that incentivize usage, encourage the purchase of resources in bulk, by the timeframe (monthly, quarterly), or maybe at specific times that benefit the provider, or the consumer. Remember, pricing is a two-way street, that can benefit the provider, as well as the consumer, but strike the balance that makes API platforms go round.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Let's Remember There Isn't Always Direct Value Generation From APIs</strong><br />Something that often gets overlooked in API operations is the indirect value they can generate. APIs are a potential marketing vehicle when done right, pushing forward the exposure of a brand, driving web or mobile traffic, or generating valuable data and content through network and application activity. Many of these activities can be measured, just like with direct API consumption, but should be treated different than commercial consumption, and potentially act as marketing, advertising, and word of mouth around the value an API brings to the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Greasing The Wheels With Valued Partners</strong><br />Public APIs have dominated the conversation for some time now, but web APIs bring just as much, or more value to trusted partners. APIs make it so I can quickly share the valuable resources I possess with those I feel would benefit most. While I try to make all of my APIs publicly available, it is my partners who get preferred access, and if I do it right, they can generate value via my APIs, and benefit what I am doing. If I do this the right way, I should be able to generate revenue from my APIs, while also sharing that exhaust with my trusted partners, and if they are the right kind of partners, they kick exhaust back my way as well.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Realizing The Value Of APIs Internally</strong><br /><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">As we've learned from the Steve Yegges rant about APIs at Amazon</a>, and&nbsp;as the myth tell us, Bezos ordered everyone at Amazon to use APIs for the exchange of internal API resources. Amazon understood that APIs bring agility, and efficiency when done well, and can help internal groups work together, and like public API access, internal consumers can also have plans tailored specifically for their needs. This is where the true benefits of APIs are evident, and unfortunately is the aspect of APIs that is least discussed out in the open for everyone to learn from.</p>
<p><strong>Units of Value Can Go Both Ways, Depending On Who Is Access An API</strong><br />It is very common for APIs to charge for access, restricting access by some of the common units of value listed above. It is less common for APIs to pay consumers for access APIs, incentivizing the publishing of content, posting of images and videos, and other value generating ways of putting APIs to work. What is the value of the first image added to an API for a business location vs. the 10th photo added? What is the value of encouraging API consumers to add their own content to a a system, augmenting existing information. There are endless ways to encourage developers to contribute to a platform, the only limit is your own plan for defining the boundaries of this participation.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-transfer-cloud.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>We Should Be Making Value Transferrable Across API Providers</strong><br />All of this provides a standardized way for API providers to define the value of API resources, and incentivize usage, while also generating needed revenue. Money is spent accessing some resources, while money is generated for publishing or refining other resources. This two way value generation shouldn't be locked up within each API providers silo, and be transferrable between API providers. In 2015, developers are using not just one or two APIs, they putting many different APIs to work, and while API providers need to cover costs, and generate revenue, so do API consumers. It is two sides of the same coin--the API balance.</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Compare The Value Of Value Across API Platforms?</strong><br />The first challenge we will face is transferring this value from one silo to another. Even when platforms have comparable API resources available, rarely will it be an apples to applies comparison. While this exercise gives us a better look into how resources can be defined, and have a price applied to their consumption across multiple plan levels, this is limited to discussion around each individual platform. Before we can compare the value across API platforms, we need to standardize the business model for each API, and establish a ranking system for each provider, that will act as a weight when comparing provider to provider, and across many providers within an industry.</p>
<p>This is just my way of exercising my views around the development of API business models. Next I will explore the concept of API rating in 2015 as I see it, and try to find the linkage to the unit price established as part of API management operations in this post. Everything I discussed above is not hypothetical. It is rooted in API infrastructure solutions provided by companies like 3Scale. To craft this story, I had my 3Scale administrative console open for my own APIs, and theoretically walked through some of the known approaches to API monetization.</p>
<p>Once I am done playing with my thoughts around rating APIs and the resources they provide, I think I'll revisit this post about plans, and craft a formal look at Amazon, Twilio, and other well known APIs, and help provide ready to go API business model blueprint that others can follow. While there is endless ways to experiment and play here, I think most of the API space is just looking for ready to go business models, that are proven and make sense, that they can plug into their operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-rating.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>API rating is a conversation I have several times a year, with different groups, and is a conversation that seems to occurring with a little more frequency in recent months. How do we know which APIs are the good ones? What constitutes a good API? How do we measure whether a contract (the API) is being adhered to, by both API provider, and potentially the consumer as well. How will we establish the Standard &amp; Poors or Moodys for the API economy? These are the API rating conversations I am having with folks.</p>
<p>These are all great questions, and something many companies have approached me looking help in solving, with nobody moving forward with this in a meaningful, and sustainable way. So to help apply some CPR to the subject, I am going to explore API rating some more, from my own point of view, in hopes of guiding some existing conversation I'm already having on the subject, and also hopefully generate some new ones. I want to quantify where we are at with this problem, what work I've put into, and maybe establish an open blueprint that the community might be able help run with.</p>
<p><strong>Starts With API Discovery</strong><br />Before we will ever have a usable approach to API ratings, we are going to have to also work on our API discovery problems. We have one open format, designed to not just index the technical side of APIs, but also the business, and political side of operations--<a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. The problem is we haven't reached a critical mass where a machine readable index of API operations is available for most of the public APIs available, as well as private indexes of the APIs that exist behind the firewall. It will take time, but soon, every actor in the API economy,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fitbit.com/apis.json">from Fitbit</a>, up to&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.trade.gov/apis.json">the International Trade Administration</a>, will have&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json indexes</a>&nbsp;of their API operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Next, What Makes A Good API?</strong><br />There are many things that goes into making an API good, or bad, and unfortunately many of these characteristics are difficult to track on in any sort of automated way. I'd say that API design is the number one complaint against APIs, but until recently there were not really any good ways to measure API consistency across many disparate APIs. I'd say the number two complaint against an API is around the documentation--good, clean, intuitive, and up to date documentation is always telling. However we can talk about API design and API documentation until the cows come home, and will make no progress on solving the question of how to measure, and quantify what a good API is, and what a bad API is.</p>
<p>In reality, there are a number of criteria that could be used to help separate the good APIs from the bad APIs. I've worked to aggregate what I consider to be some of the common building blocks across API design, deployment, management, and almost 20 other stops along the API life-cycle. From this research, I can provide a pretty good starting point for establishing a baseline rating that can be applied against all types of APIs. Part of my motivation in crafting this post, is to organize these thoughts, and publish as a potential v1 open blueprint, to help move conversations forward. I'm not saying this is what should be, but just a list of things to consider as the community contributes something.</p>
<p><strong>The Technology of APIs</strong><br />This is where all API operations, good or bad begin, with the technical implementations of the API itself. When you are dealing with something as technical and abstract as an API, it can be hard separate the technology from everything else, but I feel it is an important exercise, even if I don't always get it right. Here are some of the technological aspects to consider when rating APIs from the technical view:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design</strong>&nbsp;- How is the API designed? Is it simple, web-focused, and follows moderns conventions, and leverage HTTP over language specific characteristics.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>&nbsp;- What sort of authentication technology is employed? Are modern approaches from &nbsp;basic keys, too tokens, and OAuth employed?</li>
<li><strong>Availability</strong>&nbsp;- Is the API available? Our there significant outages involved in recent times, and what is the overall track record for a platform.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>&nbsp;- Will the API scale technically, and meet the demand of its users. Does the underlying code, server, and database scale with the demand.</li>
<li><strong>Code Resources&nbsp;</strong>- What extra code resources area available around an API from CLI to SDKs, and starter kits. Code resources play big role in API success.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks -&nbsp;</strong>The presence of webhooks for me, tells me that a platform operates as a two way street, contributes to availability, and scalability, and a nod towards real-time.</li>
</ul>
<p>To establish a true rating criteria, you would need to break many of these things down, and establish a way of actually validating in a programmatic way. You would need to be able to look for consistent API design patterns, usage of HTTP status codes, and how available and scalable a platform is. With most of the technology of an API hidden behind the facade, you are left with little to go on, but the design, authentication pattern, availability, scalability, and any other technical resources that are made available.</p>
<p><strong>The Business of APIs</strong><br />I have worked hard to understand the line between the tech, and the business of API operations. I feel this separation is critical to truly understanding why APIs work. Like the technology behind, the business approaches to API operations can be subjective, and vary from provider to provider. However, in my work I have found some ways of identifying the healthy business practices, as well as some unhealthy business practices that exist in the space.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation -&nbsp;</strong>The availability of simple, intuitive, up to date API documentation, usually of the interactive kind is standard operating procedure of good APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Registration -</strong>&nbsp;Self-service, 24/7 registration for API access is a hallmark of good APIs--leaving access considerations dealt with via multiple tiers of API plans.</li>
<li><strong>Business Model -</strong>&nbsp;A clear business model, and pricing is always present in the good APIs. It can be easy to spot the bad apples, because they tend to only be free.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;- What support resources area available? Are there multiple channels of self-service, or direct support that have regular person behind the scenes supporting?</li>
<li><strong>Communication -</strong>&nbsp;Does an API platform communicate? Are there multiple channels like a blog, Twitter, or other social accounts available?&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Change -&nbsp;</strong>How often, and rapid is change on the platform, and are changes communicated through a road-map, and other available channels?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>An API platform reflects the core business values of the company that operates it. The business of an API sets the tone for their entire community, something API consumers can contribute to, but it is ultimately left to the platform provider to set overall. It is fairly easy to identify bad actors, because of significant gaps in the business model, support, and communication around platform operations. There are many other aspects of API business operations to consider, but this provides a good base to start.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-fist.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>The Politics of APIs</strong><br />In the last three years, another significant line has emerged when determining which APIs are good ones, and which are the bad ones. While much of this area depends on legal building blocks of API operations, I call it the politics of APIs, because it tends to reflect the politics of a company, or maybe the industry it resides in. Some of these areas will make or break APIs, and definitely put them in the good or bad bucket.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terms of Service -&nbsp;</strong>What is in a terms of service? Are the heavily weighted towards the platform, or do they allow for innovation by consumers, within the ecosystem?</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Policy -</strong>&nbsp;What does privacy look like on a platform? What do official policies state, and what does actual practice look like on the platform, and among consumers?</li>
<li><strong>Platform Security -&nbsp;</strong>How is security handled across platform operations? How open is a platform about their security policies. This will be the number one criteria going forward.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency -&nbsp;</strong>How transparent is a company with platform operations, and the overall roadmap. Is there an adversarial relationship with community, or an open, collaborative one?</li>
<li><strong>Licensing -&nbsp;</strong>What software, content, and data license are in place? How is the API interface, server, and client code licensed, as well as the supporting content, and resources for the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limits -</strong>&nbsp;What rate limits are imposed by the provider, and are they consistent and fair across access plans? Do rate limits favor the platform or consumer?</li>
<li><strong>Investment -</strong>&nbsp;Who is invested in the company behind an API platform? Where in the investment cycle is a company, and how much money has been invested?</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are just a handful of the political elements of API platform operations, but they are the usual suspects when it comes to determining the good APIs from the bad ones. This area tends to be the hardest to nail down area of how we would rate API providers in my eperience. This is where the most amount of smoke and mirrors is deployed, and nothing is ever what it seems, but this area makes or breaks many API operations, in more situations than the other technical and business elements listed.</p>
<p>The areas I provided across the technical, business, and political considerations for rating APIs as good or bad, can be broken down much further. I have specific questions that should be asked about API design, communication, and platform licensing, but for this discussion I just wanted to highlight the core groups of considerations. The separation between these areas, as well as the overlap is tough to see sometimes, but is something that is coming into focus, with the more APIs that I look at through this lens.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Make One Such API Rating Model Work?</strong><br />With a rating definition in hand (theoretically) how do we move forward actually making this a reality. This is a huge problem, one very few people or companies truly grasp the scope of, and one that wave of new startups think they can solve, only to watch ALL of them fail. This is a problem that I feel will take four distinct groups to make happen, each bringing their own assets to the table, when it comes to making one such API rating model work.</p>
<p><strong>The Essential API Provider Signals</strong><br />What information can API providers share, and what signals are the sending, either consciously, or unconsciously, that can be included as part of a rating system? There are numerous aspects of API operations on the open Internet, that are ripe for discovery, monitoring, and ultimately rating how a provider approaches their operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog -</strong>&nbsp;An active blog is a great way to understand the viability, tone, and overall presence of an API provider, with a RSS bonus for monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter -</strong>&nbsp;An active Twitter account is second to a blog, when it comes to understanding&nbsp;the viability, tone, and overall presence of an API provider.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Github -</strong>&nbsp;The social coding platform is quickly surpassing Twitter and a blog as the most important signal an API can send about their viability as a platform.</li>
<li><strong>Press -</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A regular PR drumbeat out of a company is a great to understand the investment into any platform, and the tone that it will take in the community.</li>
<li><strong>Road-map -</strong> The regular update, and sharing of the platforms road-map providing as much information as possible about what is coming down the road for the platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may sound silly to track on such basic things, but when a platform is about to die, the blog and Twitter accounts go silent, and you see diminished activity on Github. These content and social signals are the heartbeat of modern API operations. If you aren't telling stories, being social, and pushing code on a regular basis, your overall rating in the space goes down.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-signals.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>The Signals From The Community, Industry, and Open Web</strong><br />What is the community saying about a platform? This is one of the benefits of being a public API operation is you can generate the right signals across the space that attract other developers, businesses, analysts, and generally open you up for inclusion in any potential API rating systems. What are some of the common signals the community sends, that could be gathered as part of an open API rating system?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog Sharing -</strong>&nbsp;Which blogs posts were shared across the community, and at large on social networks, and bookmarking sites?</li>
<li><strong>Twitter Followers -&nbsp;</strong>How many Twitter followers does a platform have? Did they buy them?</li>
<li><strong>Twitter Retweets -&nbsp;</strong>What gets retweeted by the Twitter community? What is the echo from platform operations?</li>
<li><strong>Twitter Favorites -&nbsp;</strong>How many tweets have been favorited? Even if this is just for bookmarking, it acknowledges people are paying attention.</li>
<li><strong>Github Followers -</strong>&nbsp;How many Github followers does a platform have?</li>
<li><strong>Github Repo Stars -</strong>&nbsp;How many stars has been received across a platforms repositories?</li>
<li><strong>Github Repo Forks -</strong>&nbsp;How many repositories have been forked, and how many times?</li>
<li><strong>Github Repo Watchers -&nbsp;</strong>Are they watchers of a platforms Github repository? How many?</li>
<li><strong>Platform Stories -</strong>&nbsp;What other stories are told about an API provider, via popular tech blogs, and other industry news.</li>
<li><strong>QA &amp; Forum Discussions -&nbsp;</strong>What is the presence, and conversation on sites like Stack Exchange and Quora, and what is the overall sentiment?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of the signals I tune into, when it comes to monitoring what API providers are up to across the sector. While there are no absolutes when it comes to these data points, they provide me a buffet of information to make my own decisions around, when it comes to what the community is thinking regarding any particular platform.</p>
<p><strong>What The Almighty Analysts Gods Think About An API Platform</strong></p>
<p>The third area that has a significant influence on the API space, is the analyst perspective. I put myself in this category, as I make a living analyzing the API sector. If we are going to strike a balance across the internal provider, and the public view of any single company, and its API offerings, we will need an informed analyst community to weigh in. Here are just a handful of the data points I include in my own analyst ranking variable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>My Notes -</strong>&nbsp;How many occurrences of a company are there in my notebook?</li>
<li><strong>My Curation -&nbsp;</strong>How many times have I bookmarked and curated a post from, or about a platform?</li>
<li><strong>My Posts -&nbsp;</strong>Have I written stories about a company? How many?</li>
<li><strong>My White Papers -&nbsp;</strong>Has a platform being referenced, or featured in one of my white papers or guides?</li>
<li><strong>My Tweets -</strong>&nbsp;Have I tweeted anything from a platforms Twitter account? Or a mention about them?</li>
<li><strong>My Gut -</strong>&nbsp;What is my general feeling, and gut reaction to an API platform?</li>
</ul>
<p>This reflects my own criteria that goes into my analyst ranking for a company, and yes, I have a tool that helps me calculate this across the companies, and individuals I track on. Other analysts are probably going to have their own formula, but is something I'd love to start seeing shared by the community--how do experts in the space, feel about existing APIs, and their technical, business, and political approach to API operations.</p>
<p><strong>There Is Always A Role For Government To Play In All Of This</strong><br />Whether you believe in the power of government or not, there will always be a role, both positive and potentially negative, for government of all shapes and sizes to play in this API rating system. Like other data points considered as part of this rating system, the following data points should be considered, but will mean different things to different folks, and APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filings -&nbsp;</strong>What are the SEC, IRS, and other government filings by companies who operate API platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Investigations -</strong>&nbsp;What are ongoing investigations by government agencies into companies who operate API platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Stories -</strong>&nbsp;What are some of the leaks, and other stories being told in media and government circles about how companies are viewed.</li>
<li><strong>Patents -&nbsp;</strong>Are there patent filings by specific platforms that impact the overall API space, down to specific industries.</li>
<li><strong>Legal -</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;What court battles are being waged, at any level of our legal system, that impact specific platforms, and the industries they operate in.</li>
<li><strong>Legislation -&nbsp;</strong>What legislation is being planned, or is on the books that impact any specific sector an API provider operates in.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of government induced influences that could impact the rating any particular API platform may receive. Patents could be seen as strengths or even weaknesses, and existing court battles, filings, investigations, and other government influenced decisions may weigh into rating decisions as well. The involvement by the government of all sizes is only going to increase in the API economy.</p>
<p><strong>It Will Take Everyone Working Together To Make This Work</strong><br />A realistic API rating system or systems, will take work between all the groups listed above. API providers will have to step up and be more transparent, and share the data they possess. The developer community, API service providers, and the public at large will have to share information, and knowledge they accumulate from across the space. Analysts are going to have to step up, providing leadership and analysis across all industries, as well as within specific industries. The government will play a role in not just regulating industries, but also being API providers, and consumers themselves, providing valuable data, and aggregate resources, as well as informed analysis from the vital public sector perspective.</p>

<p><strong>How Do We Make Sure An Share An Open Blueprint For Rating Algorithm(s) Exists?</strong><br />This post is just an executive summary of the summary data points I'd like to see in a potential open API rating algorithm. Ultimately I'd like to see an API-Rating outline published to Github, outlining all of the areas I track on. I'm happy to be caretaker of these open blueprints, and use Github to store the algorithm, and public or proprietary data that goes into the end rating. Ultimately it should be an open, and transparent blueprint that anyone can follow, or contribute to.</p>
<p><strong>What Are Models For Incentivizing The Investing Of Open And Proprietary Data In Rating Algorithm(s)</strong><br />In establishing an open blueprint, and house the algorithm for an open API rating blueprint, I have ideas about how we can store open, and even proprietary datasets that goes into different areas of the API rating system. Using a Github organization, a series of public, and private repositories, it is easy enough to provide a central place for everything to live. I've seen evidence of strong currents in the space that will swoop in and snatch up tooling and specification that gains adoption in the space, and know there will be many groups who seek to influence the rating system disproportionately--it has to be an open blueprint, and have the ability to support public and private data, from a variety of players, that will drive the rating results.</p>
<p><strong>This Will All Take Time, But We Need To Start Somewhere</strong><br />As with the <a href="http://apisjson.org">API discovery work I'm doing with APIs.json</a>, I know this is a long game, and will not happen overnight. APIs are the driving force behind the growth in online commerce, social, cloud, mobile, and devices, touching almost every industry in 2015, the need for not just discovery of high quality APIs, but also being able to rate them, is only going to increase. We have to begin somewhere, and while some of what I propose seems far-fetched, it represents my efforts to define a rating algorithm, and I am the only person to put anything forward, beyond thinking it should be a startup.</p>
<p>I have most of the v1 algorithm available, it would just take some work to hammer into a coherent road-map. I have some of the data needed to get a v1 rating off the ground, going back to 2011 and 2012. With some work we could pull together other missing data. However to make this work, it would require API providers to step up and share data, and API service providers to do the same. Many leading API providers will be unwilling to participate, because they are rated highly without a rating system. It will be new APIs that will be willing to contribute to such as system, in hopes they can compete with the existing leaders.</p>
<p>I see, what I'm calling API Rating, as something that needs to evolve alongside my API discovery, and API monetization research. I will setup a project, and help me tune into the bigger picture. i will also formalize my look into crafting API plans, that are driven by the business model, and monetization goals of companies playing in the API game. Alright, moving on to crafting some blueprints for Twilio, SendGrid, and other common messaging APIs for their API plans, and API rating...then we'll do some comparison, and see how any of this will actually make sense in the wild.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Oct 2015</span>
        <p>After writing&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/31/i-have-a-bunch-of-api-resources-now-i-need-a-plan-or-potentially-several-plans/">I Have A Bunch Of API Resources, Now I Need A Plan, Or Potentially Several Plans</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/31/how-are-we-going-to-create-the-standard-and-poors-and-moodys-for-the-api-economy/">How Are We Going To Create The Standard And Poors And Moodys For The API Economy</a>, I wanted to combine what I had learned while crafting these stories, and try to look at how these two areas could work together. The API plan and pricing research is derived from <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm&quot;,">existing approaches to API service composition introduced by providers like 3Scale,</a> however the rating portion is fresh territory for me, with very few precedents to follow.</p>
<p>What I see when I start wading through a structured approach for API providers to craft meaningful API plans to serve up their API resources through, and how developers will be paying for API usage, via the apps they build, I begin to see the potential of a structured approach to API plans, and pricing. When you start thinking of the implications across providers, and consider the opportunities for developers to manage API consumption across API providers, and exchange the credits they purchased, or generated via API usage--a potential blueprint for an economic engine for the API space begins to emerge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to explore this concept, by crafting a visualization, and ponder how common approaches to API plans, and pricing, could be complimented by a standardized API industry rating system.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/API-plans-API-pricing-API-rating.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The only thing really original in this diagram, is the introduction of an API rating system, and the potential for developers being able to exchange credits between the API service providers they depend on. The rest of this standard API management approaches, that are defined by API providers like 3Scale. If you aren't familiar with modern approaches to API service composition, API providers can have many different API resources, as well as many different plans for subscribing to these API services, which provide a wealth of dimension for API providers to define, price, and limit how developers put API resources to use in applications.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>T Circle</strong>&nbsp;in the above diagram is where the current magic happens, when you put modern API management solutions to work for API operations. This allows you to mix and match access to your API resources, charging different prices, to different developer groups, introduce volume usage levels, and measure as many dimensions of consumption as you desire. Rarely do successful APIs have just one rate of access to them, this approach to API management allows providers to maximize access to resources, while also maximizing potential revenue around subscriptions, and usage consumption.</p>
<p>When you start putting API providers into standard API plans, and pricing framework like this, you start seeing intra-provider opportunities, industry wide benefits, as well as potential to really make API consumers lives much easier. If there were standardized ways to understand how API providers were pricing their resources, and how they tiered access, and adjusted pricing between these tiers, the API industry competition would heat up significantly. The problem comes in when you start allowing developers to transfer credits from provider to provider, while it may seem like you are transferring common units of value, but in many cases there are big differences between each API provider and what the value of one transaction may be.</p>
<p>Once you introduce an API rating system to the equation, it provides one possible way for rating each provider, and setting a benchmark that can be used to exchange credits between each platform. If each provider operated in a credit format, that could be cashed out using an exchange rate, or possible transferred from one platform to another, you'd start to see some potentially interesting market effects. I think you'd quickly see some negative, as well as positive effects, but I think some balance could be struck between some of the common API resources being served, and consumed across the API space. Newer resources, with fewer precedent would be very volatile for a period of time.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>R Circle</strong>&nbsp;in the above diagram is mean to reflect the potential of an industry wide API rating system, when you have standardized information on API pricing, across API providers. This pricing would vary across the plans each provider offers, but you could still come up with a median pricing for individual providers, and even entire industries. When you apply the rating system you could provide a potential exchange rate that could be applied when moving credits bought, and earned via each API platform, between API providers. Developers could explore which platforms allow them generate credits by engaging with API resources, exchange to other providers, where they could then spend the credits for other services they need, in lieu of cash. This also opens up the possibilities for markets for API credits exchanged across business sectors being impacted by APIs.</p>
<p>I'm just exploring concepts involved with common approaches to API plans and pricing, and brainstorming a potential API rating system, then using my imagination to understand the developer, and industry implications of this one possible future. Only one part of this equation exists, and it would take some significant work to bring such a thing into reality, but it is fun to explore, and consider one possible design for an economic engine, that could possibly scale, and drive the API industry.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/10/29/api-visualization-exploration-using-api-definitions/">API Visualization Exploration Using API Definitions</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apihandyman.io/swagger/swagger-specification-visual-documentation/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/swagger-specification-visual-documentation.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are number of areas across the API life-cycle that are being expanded upon in the current space, thanks to the evolution of API definition formats like Swagger, API Blueprint, and RAML. One area I haven't seen as much growth as I'd like, is in the area of <a href="http://visualization.apievangelist.com/">visualizations driven by API definitions</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two distinct pools of API definition driven visualization: 1) Letting you visualize the surface area of an API 2) Letting you visualize the resource made available via an API. One area my friend the <a href="https://twitter.com/apihandyman">@APIHandyman</a> has been exploring is around the surface area of API.</p>
<p>@APIHandyman has a nice prototype created that he is calling "<a href="http://apihandyman.io/swagger/swagger-specification-visual-documentation/">Swagger Specification Visual Documentation</a>". The API Definition driven visualization uses A <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js visualization</a> to help you explore the surface area of any API that is defined using Swagger. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/06/my-wish-has-been-granted-swagger-driven-api-visualizations-from-ardoq/">I have written about API definition driven visualizations before</a>, so I am happy to see the concept being pushed forward, as we have a lot of iterations to cycle through before we find a visualization format(s) that works for different API designers, architects, and developers.</p>
<p>The visual documentation that @APIHandyman created runs on Github, and he is looking for feedback on the micro tool, and where he should take it next. He recently added a bigger information display area, but could use the communities ideas on how to make it more useful. This type of work is a time drain. Every time I started playing with Swagger + D3.js I would lose an entire evening, and have very little to show for work, so I know how valuable feedback can be.</p>
<p>I strongly feel that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/30/swagger-visualization-layer-using-d3js/">API definition driven D3.js visualizations </a>will be the future of API design, management, and orchestration. APIs are going to continue to grow in number, and scope, and we will need simple, visual ways we can quickly traverse the landscape, and makes sense of things. If you are working on an API definition driven visualization tool, either for the surface area of an API, or helping visualize the actual resources being served up, please let me know so I can showcase.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/10/29/an-api-idea-http-status-code-clinic/">An API Idea: HTTP Status Code Clinic</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-clinic.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>This is one of my ideas for an API service provider, that I will never get time to do, but would love to see exist in the space, so I am happy to put out there for someone else to do. I'm calling this one an HTTP Status Code Clinic, which would be an API definition driven API service provider (why would you do it any other way in 2015), that would help API providers tailor more useful, and meaningful HTTP status codes.</p>
<p>HTTP Status Code Clinic would be a simple software as a service, complete with its own API (why would you do it any other way in 2015), and CLI for operating as well. You would pass it a Swagger, API Blueprint, RAML, or any other API definition format, and it would return a bunch of feedback on HTTP status codes returned (or not). The process could anchor the feedback in the current API design, while also providing HTTP status code education along the way.</p>
<p>The service would have to get crafty around how it walked through an API, requesting sample data, or requiring default values for query parameters, headers, body, etc. If it was done well it could be done as a kind of wizard that walked the user through each endpoint, what was returned, and might be better solutions, as well as additional status codes that could be used. You could also include examples from popular APIs like Twilio, Twitter, and others, to show what is possible.</p>
<p>I recommend you do this as a standalone service. While it might be nice to have as part of an existing service provider stack, I think it makes more sense to offer as a standalone clinic / service that API providers could use when they are ready. API designers and architects could make it part of the API design and definition portion of their life-cycle, as well as integrate into their existing systems using the&nbsp;HTTP Status Code Clinic API--other API service providers could also integrate the features into their tooling using the API</p>
<p>This is an open API idea, yours for the taking, it you want more detail from me on how I'd approach, I would be willing to do some tech investment for a piece of the action. Good luck!</p>

<p>One of the discussions we are having <a href="http://apiware.io/">behind the scenes at APIWare.io</a>, is whether we should be hand-crafting, or auto-generating SDKs for the clients we are working with on the design, deployment, and management of their APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer is easy--we do both!&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many situations where I would push for the <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">API SDKs</a> to be hand-crafted, and designed for a specific API, as well as specific language or platform. However, with the increase in the number of APIs, and simplicity of some of the APIs I work with, crafting an API definition, and <a href="https://apimatic.io/">auto-generating your SDKs using a service like APIMATIC</a>, makes sense.</p>
<p>I've cracked open the APIMATIC SDKs, and only being fluent in JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, and C#, I can only speak to these realms of operation, but I'm happy with what the APIMATIC team is producing. For me, this isn't a black and white game, it isn't hand-crafted vs. autogenerated--it is how you employ both approaches across your API operations.</p>
<p><a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC provides high quality SDKs in 10 languages</a>, some languages I do not speak. The APIWare.io team has a wealth of programming talent on the team, and while we could hand code libraries across these areas, for all of our clients, for many of the more straightforward APIs, it just makes sense to generate. We are already an API-definition first shop, where we craft Swagger, API Blueprint, RAML, or other required API definition format, so using this to generate SDKs makes sense in many situations.</p>
<p>Are you trying to figure out the best path forward for providing high quality SDKs for your API?Llet me know how my APIWare team can help. They are willing to help you figure out the best route for providing the SDKs you need, but also help maintain them as part of the versioning, and overall roadmap for your API operatins. Even if you just need someone to talk through the pros and cons, I am here to help--let me know.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://alternate.apievangelist.com/blog/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-design-fiction.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have been writing some fictional stories on a project site I have called <a href="http://alternate.kinlane.com/blog/">Alternate Kin Lane</a> for some time now. Writing fictional stories in the tech space has provided a sort of pressure release valve for me, giving me a quick creative outlet throughout the week. Honestly, there are more stories in my notebook, than there are on the actual blog, but this is a sign for me that I need to spend more time working in this area.</p>
<p>I am making several shifts in my work lately, in response to kind of hitting the wall recently, a process that includes rethinking how I work on projects, and <a href="http://kinlane.com/2015/10/27/striking-the-right-balance-with-api-evangelist-partners/">partner with folks in the API space</a>, as well as an increased focus on the fictional side of my writing. I do not just want to write fiction that is derived from the tech space. I want to write fiction that helps me formulate my own view of the space, and who knows, maybe influence the space in similar ways my regular tech blogging has over the last five years.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with the concept of design fiction, it "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_fiction">is a method of critical design that uses fictional and narrative scenarios to envision, explain and raise questions about possible futures for design and the society</a>." Up until now I was just dumping some random, crazy ideas into my fiction notebook, and taking the time to publish a few of these on Alternate Kin Lane. Now I'd like to try and bring a little closer to my daily API monitoring and research, and see if I can use to explore concepts around the tech, business, and politics of the API space--which is touching pretty much every aspect of our personal and business lives in 2015, leaving a pretty wide playing field.</p>
<p>I think some of my writing on <a href="http://alternate.apievangelist.com/blog/">Alternate API Evangelist</a> will be just as dark as some of the stuff I've written on Alternate Kin Lane, but hoping my voice will evolve, and become more nuanced with time. The medium allows me to work through some potentially volatile concepts in a hopefully safer space--meaning, it gives me a quick out with people who disagree. It is fiction! ;-) I'm hoping this helps me work through unlimited number of scenarios that apply to the API space, but also gives me a place to vent, when the tech space gets me down--which seems to be quite often lately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I want this fictional layer of my research to be tightly woven to my regular API industry research, I also want the separation between fact and fiction to be very clear. I will put the hashtag <em><strong>#apidesignfiction</strong></em> in each story title, as well has clearly stating that it is fiction on the page, like I do with Alternate Kin Lane. This way any tweets, or social shares set expectations right away, clearly showing this is a different way of exploring the API space for me--not the API space we have, but the one we might have, or maybe should have, or maybe will have if we don't get our shit together!</p>

When you think about it, if a company is selling a product or service to API providers, encouraging an API focus--they should probably have APIs. :-)</p>
<p>As I was updating some of the news, companies, and reviewing the common building blocks I have aggregated across the 20 areas of research, I just poked my head around to see if I could find an API for each service provider. There are many things that look like a language specific API, but I am looking for a clear developer / API area, with a coherent web API available, as we'd expect from API providers in 2015.</p>
<p>After spending a couple hours looking through my core research, I found the following service providers, in the follow areas, actually had web APIs available:</p>

<p>This was my first pass through all of my core research looking for APIs, so I am sure I missed some--let me know which ones I missed. My design, hypermedia, performance, monetization, evangelism, embeddable, client, SDK, visualization, and virtualization didn't have any clear leaders who had easy to find APIs. I will update as I find them--which smells like an opportunity to me.</p>
<p>Eventually I'd like to see some common definitions to be established across all these areas of the API space, but as you can see, like the rest of the API space, there is a lot of work to be done. Now that I have a list of API service providers who have APIs, I can start crafting, and aggregating API definitions for all the APIs. Once i've done this I can start looking for the overlap across them, and see if I can highlight the common patterns, and establish some bridges for the differences between them.</p>
<p>Every potential stage of the API life-cycle will have to be automated in the future, and ironically APIs will be how we do that.</p>

        <p><a href="https://securedb.co"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/secure-db-on-premise.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was talking through the features, and roadmap for <a href="https://securedb.co">SecureDB</a> with their team the other day, and one of the conversations that came up was around <a href="https://securedb.co/encryption-features/">on-premise opporutnities for deploying encrypted user, data, and file APIs</a>. In my opinion, on-premise is something that has morphed from meaning "in our data center", to where wherever we store data and run our compute power--which could be spread across multiple cloud vendors.</p>
<p><a href="https://securedb.co">SecureDB offers an extremely valuable API commodity in 2015, encrypted user, data, and file stores</a>--something EVERY website and mobile application should have as part of their back-end. When you have something this valuable, and potentnially ubiquitous, it needs to run wherever it is needed. With this in mind SecureDB is available on demand, as a retail API solution, but they will also deploy it for you "on-premise" on AWS or Heroku, with "more platforms in the roadmap".</p>
<p>While a wholesale, on-premise, deploy anywhere API will not be required for all APIs, as some SaaS solutions won't benefit from this type of distribution, if you are a core architectural building block, or utility APIs like SecureDB, to compete in the API economy, your API will have to deployable to anywhere it is needed. With the explosion of Docker and Kubernetes, your API should technically be able to able to be deployed in any containerized environment, with a business model, licensing, and legal framework to support the different use cases.</p>
<p>The ability to deploy your API on Heroku is just a gateway drug to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/a-peek-at-the-future-with-white-label-apis/">the wholesale, white lable, containerized, API economy</a> that is coming, where the most agile, flexible, and interoperable APIs will dominate.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMRYw8VY7mFUg78AEuIbtyg"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/in-the-mood-for-http.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As you probably know, I'm always up for learning about APIs, so when <a href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">@Darrel_Miller</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gblock">@GBlock</a> started doing their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMRYw8VY7mFUg78AEuIbtyg">In the Mood for HTTP podcast</a>, I was all in. Both Darrel and Glenn are API experts, and respected leaders in the space, but more importantly both of them are super nice guys, and reflect a tone I love to experience and support across the API space.</p>
<p>The format for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMRYw8VY7mFUg78AEuIbtyg">In The Mood For HTTP</a> is simple. The audience asks questions, and Darrel and Glenn discuss. They are both very graceful in how they answer questions, extremely knowledgeable on the subjects at hand, but they are also very opinionated, and they don't always agree--the exchange between them is educational, and very benefitial to the wider API community.</p>
<p>The API duo has quickly produced three episodes. I am listening to episode three as I write this post. My only critique of the podcast is I'd like to see better indexing of the episodes, with easy text version of the questions, and a link to that specific time in the Youtube videos. I'd love to have a library of these organized in a sort of API FAQ, that I can share with my readers, and reference throughout my storytelling.</p>
<p>I'm going to explore how I can get more involved, and provide some questions, and help drive their conversations. I've enjoyed doing this with <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>, and other API related podcasts that have emerged. On this note, I encourage anyone to create their own podcast in the space, and explore finding your voice when it comes to conversations in the API space. I know many voices across the space, who I hear at API conferences like <a href="https://twitter.com/APIStrat">@APIStrat</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/APIDaysGlobal">@APIDaysGlobal</a>, which I'd like to hear in more real-time, as Darrel and Glenn are doing--if you do, I'll help support!</p>
<p>Keep up the good work you guys!</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/11/some-potentially-very-powerful-api-orchestration-with-the-amazon-api-gateway/">As I've written several posts on the recent Amazon API Gateway release</a>, one of the side things I noted about the API solution from AWS, was that API monitoring is baked in by default. As stated on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">AWS API Gateway page</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>After your API is deployed, Amazon API Gateway provides you with a dashboard to visually monitor calls to your services using Amazon CloudWatch, so you see performance metrics and information on API calls, data latency, and error rates.</em></p>
<p>This may seem like common sense to many people who have been in the API space for a while now, but for many API designers, architects, developers, and business folk who are just getting going, API monitoring may not be default for all implementations.</p>
<p>To me, AWS baking in <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">API monitoring</a> by default, demonstrates that the world of API monitoring has matured, marking an important milestone that all API providers should pay attention to. I've been watching this space grow over the last couple years, and similar to the API management space, the AWS release reflects the overall health of the API sector.</p>
<p>If you are operating any API In 2015, monitoring should be standard operating procedure, alongside your API documentation.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Oct 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-evangelism-bubble.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It can be difficult to know where to start when it comes storytelling around an API. Many of us who have been in the space, have followed the lead of Twitter, Twilio, Amazon, and others, but when you are new to the space, knowing where to start can often be paralyzing. This is something I am regularly helping clients and partners think through, and while&nbsp;<a href="https://securedb.co/">I'm thinking through the topic with SecureDB</a>, I figured I'd share the details with you my readers.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com">If you are unfamiliar with how the API Evangelist network operates, I have common building blocks available for almost 20 core stops along the API lifecycle</a>. However, when many of my partners and clients are just getting going, they are often overwhelmed by the volume of data I provide, so I regularly find myself tailoring, and distilling down a specific strategy for each conversation I engage in. I wanted to help SecureDB understand where they can start with evangelism from day one, by providing a 101 list for API evangelism, but before I could do this, I needed to make sure they had a few API building blocks in place first.</p>
<p>Wait...before we got going with a 101 API evangelism list, let's make sure the most essential element is present?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value</strong>&nbsp;- Check! Encryption for all your data in this climate is critical.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">Now, let's make sure the minimum viable&nbsp;<a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building blocks</a>&nbsp;are in place to support evangelism efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On-boarding</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Portal -&nbsp;</strong>Check. The SecureDB product is their API,&nbsp;<a href="https://securedb.co/">so the website is their portal</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Getting Started -</strong>&nbsp;Check. There is a&nbsp;<a href="https://securedb.co/docs/#quick-start1">simple quick-start</a>&nbsp;to get developer up and running.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Registration -</strong>&nbsp;Check. There is a simple,&nbsp;<a href="https://dashboard.securedb.co/dashboard/signup.html">self-service signup</a>&nbsp;for the &nbsp;platform.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>API Definition -</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://api.securedb.co/swagger/">Check. SecureDB has their API defined using Swagger.</a></li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>&nbsp;- Check. They provide&nbsp;<a href="https://securedb.co/apidocs/">an attractive Slate version</a>, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://api.securedb.co/swagger/">interactive Swagger playground</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Contact Form -</strong>&nbsp;Check. There is an easy to find c<a href="https://securedb.co/contact/">ontact form when you need help</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Email -&nbsp;</strong>Check.&nbsp;There is also an&nbsp;<a href="https://securedb.co/contact/">easy to find email</a>&nbsp;if you need it.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter -</strong>&nbsp;Check. SecureDB is available via an&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/securedb">active Twitter account.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Business Models</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong>&nbsp;- Check. There is a&nbsp;<a href="https://securedb.co/pricing/">clear pricing model available for SecureDB</a>. I know what I'm getting into, and understand tiers to climb.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog</strong>&nbsp;- Check - There is&nbsp;<a href="https://securedb.co/blog/">an existing blog, and RSS feed for SecureDB</a>&nbsp;to tell stories on.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong>&nbsp;- Check - In addition to support,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/securedb">the Twitter account is available for communicating with the community</a>, and Internet at large.</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong>&nbsp;- Check - SecureDB has an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/securedb">active LinkedIn account&nbsp;</a>for communication via the business social network.</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong>&nbsp;- I didn't find an official org account for SecureDB, but see their developers are actively working on Github.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">With this base, now I can explore some initial&nbsp;<a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API evangelism building blocks</a>&nbsp;SecureDB can think about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goals</strong> 
<ul>
<li>New users - We want to attract some new users to put SecureDB to work.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Storytelling</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Projects -&nbsp;</strong>What are some projects we could kick off exploring for storytelling purposes?  
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure Users -&nbsp;</strong>Let's show basic example that secures a user base for any application.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Data -&nbsp;</strong>Move a little further and secure the data for an application.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Files -&nbsp;</strong>Beyond data, let's show how to secure files used as part of an application.</li>
<li><strong>API Key Manager -</strong>&nbsp;Based upon&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/24/the-emerging-need-for-api-key-management-solutions">a story I did last week</a>, on need for secure API storage.</li>
<li><strong>SecureDB API Strategy -</strong>&nbsp;What I am doing here, telling the story of their API strategy (real-time).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stories -</strong>&nbsp;What are some of the stories across these projects that we could tell?  
<ul>
<li>Let's Explore...</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Internal -&nbsp;</strong>Are we sharing these stories internally, and encouraging them to engage in sharing, and conversations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This list personalized for SecureDB, from the numerous building blocks I've aggregated across API management and evangelism strategies I've helped craft, and gathered by watching the approach of leading API providers. This is why I partner with companies like SecureDB, so that I can move forward, and ultimately share the information I've gathered, personalized in different ways, as a regular drumbeat on my blog(aka storytelling). It helps me evolve my ideas, share them with partners and clients, as well as with you my readers.</p>
<p>This is just an example of what I do behind the scenes for my partners, and an&nbsp;<a href="http://apiware.io">example of the approach brought to the table by my APIWare partner</a>. Let me know if we can help you get over the hump with your API strategy, whether you are at the beginning of the journey like SecureDB, or further down the line--I am happy to talk to you at any stage.</p>

<p><a href="https://lockr.io/">An API key management service targeting Drupal developers came across my radar this week</a>. The service is very focused, in that it is a Drupal module, and is focused on helping Drupal developers manage the keys they use across a single app or installation, but I think it represents a potentially larger trend.</p>
<p>I think this particular solutions is just a symptom of a growing problem for developers of any type--how do you manage the number of keys you are depending on for you application(s). API consumers are in need of a plug and play way of to store, access, and manage the increasing number of API keys they put in use, otherwise we will be looking at a pretty serious security problem, adding to the existing security issues API providers and consumers face.</p>
<p>If you need evidence of the viability of API Key management solutions, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS has one</a>. Ok, why don't developer just use AWS? Well they should if it makes sense, but we also need other competing, and complimentary key management solutions, to ensure a healthy API space. Not all users are going to need full-blown IAM solutions, they just need a simple, encrypted place to put all their keys, and some utilities to help them manage them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I store my keys in a JSON config file stored in the private Github repo for any application I develop, and for each org, I have some crude API key management utilities to help me manage turnover. My server apps can cache the config file locally, and my client side apps run on Github Pages, using SSL, and Github OAuth to open up API key access they need.</p>
<p>I will be keeping an eye out for more API key management solutions, and begin the process of documenting the building blocks of these product and services, like I do with other areas. If you are looking to develop an API key management solution, feel free to reach out, as I have some feedback for your road-map along the way, and existing tools you could use to make it easier.&nbsp;</p>
