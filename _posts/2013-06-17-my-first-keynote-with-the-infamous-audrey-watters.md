{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im doing a keynote this weekend with the infamous, edtech rabble-rouser Audrey Watters (@audreywatters) at InstructureCon in Park City Utah, this Wednesday June 19th.Audrey and I will be talking about the importance of data portability when it comes to education technology.Instructure, the creators of Canvas, a next generation learning management system (LMS), has been so kind to bring us both out.While Audrey and I spend a lot of time speaking at conferences, this is our first event where we will be both sharing the stage.If you are unaware, Audrey and her Hack Education blog isnt just a partner in crime with API Evangelist when it comes to data portability, she has also played the role of my girlfriend for almost four years.</p>
