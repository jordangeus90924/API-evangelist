{% include JB/setup %}<p>Photo by Nicholas_T APIs are about to enter a new phase, one where developers can easily program using multiple APIs at once, and non-developers can easily introduce API automation into both their business and personal worlds. A time where APIs are seen as a valuable resource anyone can quickly put use, not just as a technical interface only the geekiest of us understand.Web APIs have matured out of its earlier service oriented architecture (SOA) roots, often shedding a rigid SOAP approach to a more flexible RESTful implementation, increased efficiency by opting for more lightweight JSON over bloated XML, and becoming more accessible with API explorers and interactive documentation like Swagger, Mashery I/O Docs, and Apigee’s Console.Now with over 6,000 public APIs available, there is a need to get more efficient about how we work with APIs, and evolve to where we can truly program the web. But to get there, we have to add a new platform layer that can help standardize the authentication, interfaces and resource types available--simplifying how not just developers, but average users can take advantage of APIs.</p>
