{% include JB/setup %}<p>Superfeedr is now supporting PubSubHubbub for data APIs.PubSubHubbub was initially created for XML to alleviate the number of times a feed is polled versus how many times it actually has an update.The bandwidth consumption and server load of an API can be reduced greatly by adding a PubSubHubbub layer on a data API.Primary areas of a Superfeedr PubSubHubbub deployment are: Resource Identification - Identify what services your developers / applications are polling the most.Identify how many requests are made against how many times information was returned.</p>
