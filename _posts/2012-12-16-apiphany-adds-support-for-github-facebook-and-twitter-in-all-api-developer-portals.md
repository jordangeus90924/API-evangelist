{% include JB/setup %}<p>API service provider APIphany followed some of my advice this last week, and added support for Github, Facebook and Twitter in all of their developer portals.Using oAuth from Twitter, Facebook and especially Github for API providers, just makes sense in this online world.As a user, I donâ€™t want to create yet another login--I want to pick from my preferred social network.It is good to see APIphany make sure their customers deliver friction-less onboarding for their developers, who are building mobile and web applications on top of their APIphany powered APIs.</p>
