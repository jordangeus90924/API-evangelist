        <span class="post-date">30 Aug 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/va/va-developer-portal.png" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I have been working on API and open data efforts at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for five years now. I’m passionate about pushing forward the API conversation at the federal agency because I want to see the agency deliver on its mission to take care of veterans. My father, and my step-father were both vets, and I lived through the fallout from my step-fathers two tours in Vietnam, exposure to the VA healthcare and benefits bureaucracy, and ultimately his passing away from cancer which he acquired from to his exposure to Agent Orange. I truly want to see the VA streamline as many of its veteran facing programs as they possibly can.</p>

<p>I’ve been evangelizing for API change and leadership at the VA since I worked there in 2013. I’m regularly investing unpaid time to craft stories that help influence people I know who are working at the VA, and who are potentially reading my work. Resulting in posts like <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/10/26/my-response-on-the-department-of-veterans-affairs-rfi-for-the-lighthouse-api-management-platform/">my response to the VA’s RFI for the Lighthouse API management platform</a>, which included <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/02/24/department-of-veterans-affairs-lighthouse-platform-rfi-round-two/">a round two response a few months later</a>. Influence through storytelling is the most powerful tool I got in my API evangelist toolbox.</p>

<p><strong>This Is An Amazon Web Services Opportunity</strong><br />
The most popular story on my blog is, “<a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">The Secret to Amazon’s Success–Internal APIs</a>”. Which tells a story of the mythical transition of Amazon from an online commerce website to the cloud giant, who is now powering a significant portion of the web. The story is mostly fiction, but continues to be the top performing story on my blog six years later. I’ve heard endless conference talks about this subject, I’ve seen my own story framed on the wall in enterprise organizations in Europe and Australia, and as a feature link on internal IT portals. This is one of the most important stories we have in the API sector, and what is happening at the VA right now will become similar to the AWS story when we are talking about delivering government services a decade from now.</p>

<p><strong>The VA Is Going All In On An API Vision</strong><br />
One of the reasons the VA will obtain the intended results from their API initiative is because they are going all in on APIs across the agency. The API effort isn’t just some sideshow going on in a single department or group. This API movement is being led out of the VA’s Digital Innovation center, but is being adopted, picked up, and moved forward by many different groups across the large government agency. When I did <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/06/18/va-lighthouse-landscape-analysis-and-roadmapping-project-report/">my landscape analysis for them</a>, I scanned as much of their public digital presence as possible in a two week timeframe, and provided them with a list of targets to go after. I see the scope of the results obtained from VA landscape analysis present in the APIs I’m seeing published to their portal, and in development by different groups, revealing in the beginnings of an agency-wide API journey.</p>

<p><strong>The Use Of developer.va.gov Demonstrates The Scope</strong><br />
One way you can tell that the VA is going all in on an API vision, is their usage of the <a href="http://developer.va.gov">developer.va.gov</a> subdomain. This may seem like it is a trivial thing, but after looking at thousands of API operations, and monitoring some of them for eight years, the companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies to dedicate a subdomain to their API programs are always more committed to them, and invest the appropriate amount of resources needed to be successful. These API leaders always stand out from the organizations that publish their API efforts as an entry in their help center or knowledge-base, or make it just a footnote in their online presence. The use of the developer.va.gov subdomain demonstrates the scope of investment going on over at the VA in my experience.</p>

<p><strong>The VA Is Properly Funding Their API Efforts</strong><br />
One of the most common challenges I see API teams face is the lack of resources to do what they need to do. API teams that can’t afford to deliver across multiple stops along the API lifecycle, cutting corners on testing, monitoring, security, documentation, and other common building blocks of a successful API platform. Properly funding an API initiative, and making it a first class citizen within the enterprise is essential to success. The number one response an API platform gets rendered ineffective is due to a lack of resources to properly deliver, evangelize, and scale API operations. This condition often leaves API programs unable to effectively spread across large organizations, properly reach out to  partners, and generate the attention a public API program will need to be successful. From what I’ve seen so far, the VA is properly funding the expansion of the API vision at the agency, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p><strong>The VA Is Providing Access To Meaningful API Resources</strong><br />
I’ve seen thousands of APIs get launched. Large enterprise always start with the safest resources possible. Learning by delivering resources that won’t cause any waves across the organization, which can be a good thing, but after a while, it is important that the resources you put forth do cause waves, and make change across an organization. The VA started with simple APIs like the VA Facilities API, but is quickly shifting gears into benefits, veteran validation, health, and other APIs that are centered around the veteran. I’m seeing the development of APIs that provide a full stack of resources that touch on every aspect of the veterans engagement with the VA. In order to see the intended results from the VA API efforts, they need to be delivering meaningful API resources, that truly make an impact on the veteran. From what I’m seeing so far, the VA is getting right at the heart of it, and delivering the useful API resources that will be needed across web, mobile, and device based applications that are serving veterans today.</p>

<p><strong>There Is Transparency And Storytelling</strong><br />
Every one of my engagements with the VA this year has ended up on my blog. One of the reasons I stopped working within the VA back in 2013 was there were too many questions about being able to publish stories on my blog. I haven’t seen such questions of my work this year, and I’m seeing the same tone being struck across other internal and vendor efforts. The current API movement at the VA understands the significance of transparency, observability, and of doing much of the API work the VA out in the open. Sure, there is still the privacy and security apparatus that exists across the federal government, but I can see into what is happening with this API movement from the outside-in. I’m seeing the right amount of storytelling occurring around this effort, which will continue to sell the API vision internally to other groups, laterally to other federal agencies, and outwards to software vendors and contractors, as well as sufficiently involving the public throughout the journey.</p>

<p><strong>Evolving The Way Things Get Done With Micro-Procurement</strong><br />
Two of the projects I’ve done with the VA have been micro-procurement engagements: 1) <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/06/18/va-lighthouse-landscape-analysis-and-roadmapping-project-report/">VA API Landscape Analysis</a>, and 2) <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/07/19/api-governance-models-in-the-public-and-private-sector/">VA API Governance Models In The Public And Private Sector</a>. Both of these projects were openly published to GitHub, opening up the projects beyond the usual government pool of contractors, then were awarded and delivered within two week sprints for less than $10,000.00. Demonstrating that the VA is adopting an API approach to not just changing the technical side of delivering service, but also working to address the business side of the equation. While still a very small portion of what will be needed to get things done at the VA, it reflects an important change in how technical projects can be delivered at the VA. Working to decompose and decouple not just the technology of delivering APIs at the VA, but also the business, and potentially the internal and vendor politics of delivering services at scale across the VA.</p>

<p><strong>The VA Has Been Doing Their API Homework</strong><br />
As of the last couple of months, the VA is shifting their efforts into high gear with <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index.php?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=989a6748f86f4851e30b6585b22ab137&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0">an API management</a>, as well as an <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index.php?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=f7a6f0c12e1a4801df53d7f3fa239d93&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">API development and operations</a> solicitation(s) to help invest in, and build capacity across the agency. However, before these solicitations were crafted the VA has been doing some serious homework. You can see this reflected in the RFI effort which started in 2017, and continued in 2018. <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA-Micropurchase-Repo">You can see this reflected in the micro-procurement contracts that have been executed</a>, and are in progress as we speak. I’ve seen a solid year of the VA doing their homework before moving forward, but once they’ve started moving forward, they’ve managed to be able to shift gears rapidly because of the homework they’ve done to date.</p>

<p><strong>Investing In An API Lifecycle And Governance</strong><br />
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope/builder/filtered/43_113_800_500_0_max_0_-5_-5.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" />
I am actively contributing to, and tuning into the API strategy building going on at the VA, and I’m seeing investment into a comprehensive approach to delivering all APIs in a consistent way across a modern API lifecycle. Addressing API design, mocking, deployment, orchestration, management, documentation, monitoring, and testing in a consistent way using an OpenAPI 3.0 contract. Something that is not just allowing them to reliably deliver APIs consistently across different groups and vendors, but is also allowing them to develop a comprehensive API governance strategy to measure, report upon, and evolve their API lifecycle and strategy over time. Dialing in how they deliver services across the VA, by leveraging the development, management, and operational level capacity they are bringing to the table with the solicitations referenced above. This approach demonstrates the scope in which the VA API leadership understands what will be necessary to transform the way the VA delivers services across the massive federal agency.</p>

<p><strong>Providing An API Blueprint For Other Agencies</strong><br />
What the VA is doing is poised to change the way the VA meets its mission. However, because it is being done in such a transparent and observable way, with every stop along the lifecycle being so well documented and repeatable, they are also developing an API blueprint that other federal agencies can follow. There are other healthy API blueprints to follow across the federal government, out of Census, Labor, NASA, CFPB, FDA, and others, but there is not an agency-wide, API definition driven, full life cycle, complete with governance blueprint available at the moment. The VA API initiative has the potential to be the blueprint for API change across the federal government, becoming the Amazon Web Services story that we’ll be referencing for decades to come. All eyes are on the VA right now, because their API efforts reflect an important change at the agency, but also an important change for how the federal government delivers services to it’s people.</p>

<p>I am all in when it comes to support APIs at the VA. As I mentioned earlier, my primary motivation is rooted in my own experiences with the VA system, and helping it better serve veterans. My secondary motivation is all about contributing to, and playing a role in the implementation of one of the significant API platforms out there, which if done right, will change how our federal government works. I’m not trying to be hyperbolic in my storytelling around the VA API platform, I truly believe that we can do this. As always, I am working to be as honest as I can about the challenges we face, and I know that the API journey is always filled with twists and turns, but with the right amount of <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/07/18/diagramming-the-components-of-api-observability/">observability</a>, I believe the VA API platform can deliver on the vision being set by leadership at the agency, and why I find this work to be so significant.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2018</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope/builder/filtered/23_19_800_500_0_max_0_-5_-1.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I am always fascinated when I get push back from people about API management, the authentication, service composition, logging, analysis, and billing layer on the world of APIs. I seem to be find more people who are skeptical that it is even necessary anymore, and that it is a relic of the past. When I first started coming across the people making these claims earlier this year I was confused, but as I’ve pondered on the subject more, I’m convinced their position is more about the world of venture capital, and investment in APIs, that it is about APIs.</p>

<p>People who feel like you do not need to measure the value being exchanged at the API layer aren’t considering the technology or business of delivering APIs. They are simply focused on the investment cycles that are occurring, and see API management as something that has been done, it is baked into the cloud, and really isn’t central to API-driven businesses. They perceive that the age of API management as being over, it is something the cloud giants are doing now, thus it isn’t needed. I feel like this is a symptom of tech startup culture being so closely aligned with investment cycles, and the road map being about investment size and opportunity, and rarely the actual delivery of the thing that brings value to companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies.</p>

<p>I feel this perception is primarily rooted in the influence of investors, but it is also based upon a limited understanding of API management, and seeing APIs being a about delivering public APIs, maybe with a complimenting a SaaS offering, and a free, pro, and enterprise tiers of access. When in reality API management is about measuring, quantifying, reporting upon, and in some cases billing for the value that is exchanged at the system integration, web, mobile, device, and network application levels. However, to think API operators shouldn’t be measuring, quantifying, reporting, and generating revenue from the digital bits being exchanged behind ALL applications, just demonstrates a narrow view of the landscape.</p>

<p>It took me a few months to be able to see the evolution of API management from 2006 to 2016 through the eyes of an investment minded individual. Once the last round of consolidation occurred, Apigee IPO’d, and API management became baked into Amazon, Google, and Azure, it fell of the radar for these folks. It’s just not a thing anymore. This is just one example of how investment influences the startup road map, as well as the type of thinking that goes on amongst investor influence, painting an entirely different picture of the landscape, than what I see going on. Helping me understand more about where this narrative originates, and why it gets picked up and perpetuated within certain circles.</p>

<p>To counter this view of the landscape, from 2006 to 2016 I saw a very different picture. I didn’t just see the evolution of Mashery, Apigee, and 3Scale as acquisition targets, and cloud consolidation. I also saw the awareness that API management brings to the average API provider. Providing visibility into the pipes behind the web, mobile, device, and network applications we are depending on to do business. I’m seeing municipal, state, and federal government agencies waking up to the value of the data, content, and algorithms they possess, and the potential for generating much needed revenue off commercial access to these resources. I’m working with large enterprise groups to manage their APIs using 3Scale, Apigee, Kong, Tyk, Mulesoft, Axway, and AWS API Gateway solutions.</p>

<p>Do not worry. Authenticating, measuring, logging, reporting, and billing against the value flowing through our API pipes isn’t going anywhere. Yes it is baked into the cloud. After a decade of evolution, it definitely isn’t the early days of investing in API startups. But, API management is still a cornerstone of the API life cycle. I’d say that API definitions, design, and deployment are beginning to take some of the spotlight, but authentication, service composition, logging, metrics, analysis, and billing will remain an essential ingredient when it comes to delivering APIs of any shape or size. If you study this layer of the API economy long enough, you will even see some emerging investment opportunities at the API management layer, but you have to be looking through the right lens, otherwise you might miss some important details.</p>

<p>I’ve been working a couple organizations who are struggling with providing information within their API developer portal intended for API publishers, pushing their API portal beyond just being for their API consumers. Some of the folks I’ve been working with haven’t thought about their API developer portals being for both API publishers and consumers, and asked me to weigh in on the pros and cons of doing this. Helping them understand how they can continue their journey towards not just being an API platform, but also an API marketplace.</p>

<p>Some of the conversations we were having about providing API lifecycle materials to API developers, helping them deliver APIs consistently across all stops along lifecycle, focused on creating a separate portal for API publishers, decoupling them from where the APIs would be discovered and consumed. After some discussion, and consideration, it feels like it would be an unnecessary disconnect, to have API publishers going to a different location than where their APIs would end up being discovered, and integrated with. That having them actively involved in the publishing, presentation, and even support of, and engagement with consumers would benefit everyone involved.</p>

<p>Think of it being like Rapid API, but a large company, organization, institution, or government agency. You can find APIs, and integrate with existing APIs, or you can also become an API publisher, and be someone who helps publish and manage APIs as well. You will have one account, but you can find documentation, usage information and other resources for the APIs you consume, but then you will also access information, and usage data on the APIs you’ve published. Pushing API developers within an organization to actively think about both sides of the API coin, and learn how to be both provider and consumer. Helping add to the catalog of APIs, but also helping evolve and grow the army of API people across an organization.</p>

<p>We still have a lot of work ahead of us when it comes to fleshing out what type of information we should provide to API publishers, and how to cleanly separate the two worlds, but I feel the realization that a portal can be both for API publishers and consumers was an important one for these groups. I feel like it represents a milestone in the maturity and growth of their API programs, where the API developer portal has grown into something that everyone should be tuning into, and participating in. It isn’t just something that a single team, or handful of individuals managed, and it is has become something that is becoming a group effort. Sharing the load of operating the API portal, and keeping things up to date and active, further contributing to the potential success of the platform, shielding it from becoming yet another web service or API catalog that gets forgotten about on the network.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/4882162452_fa3126b38d_b_aqua.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I am trying to develop a base base API pricing formula for determining what my hard costs are for each API I’m publishing using Amazon RDS, EC2, and AWS API Gateway. I also have some APIs I am deploying using Amazon RDS, Lambda, and AWS API Gateway, but for now I want to get a default base for determining what operating my APIs will cost me, so I can mark up and reliably generate profit on top of the APIs I’m making available to my partners. AWS has all the data for me to figure out my hard costs, I just need a formula that helps me accurately determine what my AWS bill will be per API.</p>

<p>Math isn’t one of my strengths, so I’m going to have to break this down, and simmer on things for a while, before I will be able to come up with some sort of working formula. Here are my hard costs for what my AWS resources will cost me, for three APIs I have running currently in this stack:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>AWS RDS</strong> - I am running a db.r3.large instance which costs me $0.29 per hour or 211.70 per month, with the bandwidth free to my Amazon EC2 instances in the same availability zone. I do not have any public access, so I don’t have any incoming or outgoing traffic, except from the EC2 instance.</li>
  <li><strong>AWS EC2</strong> - I am running a t2.large instance which costs me $0.0928 per hour or $67.74 per month with bandwidth out costing me $0.155 per GB. I’m curious if they have an Amazon EC2 to AWS API Gateway data consideration? I couldn’t find anything currently.</li>
  <li><strong>AWS API Gateway</strong> - Overall using AWS API Gateway costs me $3.50 per million API calls received, with the first 1GB costing me $0.00/GB, and costing me $0.09/GB for the next 9.999 TB.</li>
</ul>

<p>Across these three APIs, I am seeing an average of 5KB per responses, which is an important variable to use in these calculations. The <a href="https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">AWS API Calculator</a> helps me figure out your monthly bill across services, but it doesn’t help me break down what my hard costs are per API call. I need to establish a flat rate of what it costs for a single API call to exist. Each API will be in its own plan, so I can charge different rates for different APIs, but I need a baseline that I start with for each API call to make sure I’m covering my hard AWS costs. Sure, the more API calls I make, the more profitable I’ll be, but at some point I’ll also have to scale the infrastructure to keep a certain quality of service–there are a number of things to consider here.</p>

<p>I envision my API pricing having the following components:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Base</strong> - A base cost to cover my AWS bill, considering AWS RDS, EC2, and API Gateway hard costs.</li>
  <li><strong>Resource</strong> - A price for covering investment in resource. Work finding, cleaning up, refining, and evolving.</li>
  <li><strong>Markup</strong> - The percentage of markup for each API call, allowing me to generate a profit from the resources I’m providing.</li>
  <li><strong>Partner</strong> - Provide a volume discount, charging light users more, and giving a break to my partners who are consumer larger volumes.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m studying other pricing models from the telco, and software hosting spaces. I’ll also be doing some landscape analysis to see what people are charging for comparable API resources. I possess a wealth of data on what API providers and service providers are charging for their services. The trick will be finding comparable services to what I’m offering, and for the unique resources I possess, I’m going to have to be able to set my own price, and then test out my assumptions, and formula over time–until I find the sweet spot for covering my hard costs, and generating profit at some point from a specific service I’m offering.</p>

<p>If you have an advice for me. Help on the math side of things, or examples from other industries, I’d love to hear more. I’ll be open sourcing and sharing everything I figure out, and tell the story of how it is being applied to each API I am publishing. I want the history to be present for each of my APIs, adding to my wider <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a> and <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API planning</a> research. In the end, I don’t think there is a perfect answer to what the pricing for an API should be. The best path forward involves covering your hard costs, and then experimenting over time to see what the market will bear. This is why AWS has gotten so good at doing this for cloud, because they have been doing this work for over a decade now. I am sure they have a lot of data, as well as experience understanding how to price API resources so they are both competitive, disruptive, and profitable.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/va/va-developer-portal.png" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I wanted to take a moment and review t<a href="https://developer.va.gov/">he Department Of Veterans Affairs (VA) new developer portal</a>. Spending some time considering at how far they’ve come, what they published so far, and brainstorm on what the future might hold. Let me open by saying that I am working directly and indirectly with the VA on a variety of paid projects, but I’m not being paid to write about their API effort–that is something I’ve done since I worked there in 2013. I will craft a disclosure to this effect that I put at the bottom of each story I write about the VA, but I wanted to put out there in general, as I work through my thoughts on what is happening over at the VA.</p>

<p><strong>The VA Has Come A Long Way</strong><br />
I wanted to open up this review with a nod towards how far the VA has come. There have been other publicly available APIs at the VA, as well as a variety of open data efforts, but the VA is clearly going all in on APIs with this wave. The temperature at VA in 2013 when it came to APIs was lukewarm at best. With the activity I’m seeing at the moment, I can tell that the temperature of the water has gone way up. Sure, the agency still has a long way to go, but from what I can tell, the leadership is committed to the agencies API journey–something I have not seen before.</p>

<p><strong>Developer.VA.Gov Sends The Right Signal</strong><br />
It may not seem like much, but providing a public API portal at developer.va.gov sends a strong signal that the VA is seriously investing in their API effort. I see a lot of API programs, and companies who have a dedicated domain, or subdomain for their API operations are always more committed than people who make it just a subsection of their existing website, or existing as a help entry in a knowledge-base. It is important for federal agencies to have their own developer.[domain].gov portal that is actively maintained–which will be the next test for the VA’s resolve, keeping the portal active and growing.</p>

<p><strong>The General Look And Feel Of The Portal</strong><br />
I like the minimalist look of the VA developer portal. It is simple. Easy on the eyes. I feel like the “site is currently under development” is unnecessary, because this should never cease to be. I like the “an official website of the United States government”, it is clean, and official looking. I’m happy to see the “Get help from Veterans Crisis Line”, and is something that should be on any page with services, data, or content for veterans. I like the flexible messaging area (FMA), where it says “Put VA Data to Work”. I’d like to see this section become an evolving FMA, with a wealth of messages rolling through it, educating the ecosystem about what is happening across the VA developer platform at any given moment.</p>

<p><strong>Getting Started And Learning More</strong><br />
The learn more about VA APIs off the FMA area on home page drops me into benefits API overview, which happens to be the first category of APIs on the documentation page. I recommend isolating this to its own “getting started” page, which provides an overview of how to get started across all APIs. Providing background on the VA developer program, as well as the other building blocks of getting started with APIs, like requesting access, studying the API documentation, and the path to production for any application you are developing. The getting started for the VA developer portal should be a first class citizen, with its own page, and a logical presentation of exactly the building blocks developers will need to get started–then they can move onto documentation across all the API categories.</p>

<p><strong>There Are Valuable APIs Available</strong><br />
Once you do actually begin looking at the API documentation available within the VA developer portal, you realize that there are truly valuable APIs available in there. Don’t get me wrong, the <a href="https://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Developers">Arlington National Cemetery API</a> is important, which has been the only publicly available API from the VA for several years, but when I think about VA APIs, I’m looking for resources that make a meaningful and significant impact on a vets life today:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/benefits"><strong>Benefits Intake</strong></a> - Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) document uploads.</li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/appeals"><strong>Appeals Status</strong></a> - Enables approved organizations to submit benefits-related PDFs and access information on a Veteran’s behalf.</li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.va.gov/explore/facilities/docs/facilities"><strong>Facilities API</strong></a> - Use the VA Facility API to find relevant information about a specific VA facility. For each VA facility, you’ll find contact information, location, hours of operation and available services.</li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.va.gov/explore/health/docs/argonaut"><strong>Veterans Health API</strong></a> - [There is no concise description for this API, and what is there needs some serious taming, and pulling out as part of the portal.]</li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.va.gov/explore/verification"><strong>Veteran Verification</strong></a> - We are working to give Veterans control of their information – their service history, Veteran status, discharge information, and more – and letting them control who sees it.</li>
</ul>

<p>One minor thing, but will significantly contribute to the storytelling around VA APIs, is the consistent naming of APIs. Notice that only two of them have API in the title. I’m really not advocating for API to be in the title or not in the title. I am really advocating for consistency in naming, so that storytelling around them flows better. I lean towards using API in each title, just so that their titles in the documentation, OpenAPI contract behind, and everywhere these APIs travel are consistent, meaningful, and explain what is available.</p>

<p>I like the organizing of APIs into the three categories of benefits, facilities, and health. I’d say veteran verification is a little out of place. Maybe have a veteran category, and it is the first entry? IDK. I’m thinking there needs to be a little planning for the future, and what constitutes a category, and some guidance on how things are defined, broken down, and categories, so that there is some thought put into it the API catalog as it grows. A little separation of concerns in categorization, that can maybe begin to contribute the overall microservices strategy across the VA.</p>

<p><strong>The Path To Production For Alpha API Clients</strong><br />
I like the path to production information for alpha API clients, I felt like it should be its own dedicated page, as one building blocks of the getting started section. However, once I started scrutinizing, it seemed like it was a separate process potentially for each individual API or category of APIs. If it can be a standalone item, I’d make it one, and link to it from each individual API category, or individual API. It it can’t be, I’d figure out to make it an expandable section, or subsection of the docs. It isn’t something I want to have to scroll through when working with an API and its documentation. Sure, I want to be aware of it, and be able to understand it as part of on-boarding, and revisiting it at a later date, but I don’t need it to be part of the core documentation page–I just want to get at the interactive API documentation.</p>

<p><strong>Self-Service Signup</strong><br />
The process for signing up seems smooth. I haven’t been approved for access, and the review process makes a lot of sense. I’ll invest time in a separate story taking a look at the signup and on-boarding process, as well as the path to production flow for API clients, but I wanted to lightly reference as part of the review. I’d say the one confusing piece was leaving the website for the signup form, and then being dropped back at https://www.oit.va.gov/developer/, without much of any information about what was happening. It was a little jarring, and the overall flow, and process needs some smoothing out. I get that we are just getting started here, so I’m too worried about this–I just wanted to make a note of it.</p>

<p><strong>The Essentials Are There</strong><br />
Overall, the essentials are present at the VA developer area. It is a great start, and has the making of a good developer API portal. It just isn’t very mature, and you can tell things are just getting started. You can signup, get at API documentation, and understand what it takes to build an application on top of VA API resources. Adding to, refining, and further polishing what is there will take time, so I do not want to be too critical of what the VA has published–it is a much better start than I’ve seen out of other federal agencies.</p>

<p>There are some other random items I’d like to reference, as well as brainstorm a little on what I’d like see invested in next, helping ensure the VA API portal provides what it needed for developers to be successful:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Terms of Service</strong> - It is good to see the basics of the TOS, and privacy policy there. I’d like to see more about privacy, security, and service level agreements (SLA).</li>
  <li><strong>Use Of GitHub Issues</strong> - I like the submission GitHub issues to request production access, and think it is a healthy use of GitHub issues forms, and is something the brings observability to the on-boarding process across the community.</li>
  <li><strong>Email Support</strong> - Beyond using GitHub issues for support and on-boarding, I see alex.yale-Loehr@va.gov a lot across the site. I get why you want to be at the center of things, but email support should be made generic, and enable group ownership of the email support workflow.</li>
  <li><strong>Road Map</strong> - I’d like to see a roadmap of what is being planned, as well as a change log for what has already been accomplished.</li>
  <li><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong> - I’d like to see an FAQ page, with questions and answers broken down by category, allowing me to browse some of the common questions as I’m getting up to speed.</li>
  <li><strong>Code Samples &amp; SDKs</strong> - I’d like to see some more code samples in a variety of programming languages, either baked into the interactive documentation, or available on its own SDK / Code Libraries pages. I get if the VA doesn’t want to get in the business of doing this, but with an OpenAPI core, there are more options available out there to generate code samples, libraries, and SDKs. I think <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/">this vets API client</a> effort needs to be pulled onto a code samples and SDKs page, and there be more investment in projects like this.</li>
  <li><strong>OpenAPI Download</strong> - I’d like to see a clear icon or button for downloading the OpenAPI 3.0 contract for each of the available APIs. I want to be able to use the OpenAPI definition for more than just documentation.</li>
  <li><strong>OpenAPI 3.0</strong> - I’m very happy to see OpenAPI 3.0 powering the API documentation, which I think is a little detail that shows the VA API team has been doing their homework.</li>
  <li><strong>Postman Collections</strong> - I’d like to see a Run in Postman button at the top right corner of each API’s documentation, allowing me to quickly load up each API into my Postman API integration and development environment.</li>
  <li><strong>Communications</strong> - I’d like to see a blog, a Twitter account, and emphasis on the VA Github account. As an API consumer I’d like to see that someone is home besides alex.yale-Loehr@va.gov, and be able to have regular asynchronous conversations, and may engage synchronously during API office hours, or other format.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll stop there. I have endless more ideas of what I’d like to see in the VA developer portal, but I’m just happy to see such a clean, informative portal up and running at developer.va.gov. I’m stoked they are working on delivering real APIs that offer value to the Veteran–that is why we are doing all of this, right? I’m curious to learn about what other APIs already exist and can just be hung within this portal, as well as what APIs are planned for the immediate road map. While there are still missing parts and pieces, what they’ve published is a damn fine start to the VA developer program.</p>

<p>Next, I’m going to do a deep dive into what I’d like to see in the getting started page, as well as the path to production guidance. I’d also like to do some deep thinking on the production application (regular) check-in and review processes. I have a short list of concepts I want to flesh out, and questions I would like to answer in future posts. I just wanted to make sure I took a moment to review <a href="https://developer.va.gov/">the VA’s hard work on their new developer portal</a>. The publishing of their developer portal marks a significant milestone in the agency’s API journey, marking the spot where their API platform is beginning to shift into a higher gear.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/fence_dark_dali.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’ve learned a lot in eight years of operating API Evangelist. One of the most important things I’ve learned to do is separate my personal belief and interest in technology from the realities of the business world. I’ve learned that not all businesses are ready for the change that doing APIs bring, and that many businesses really aren’t interested in the interoperability, portability, and observability that APIs bring to the table. Despite what I may believe, APIs in the real world often have a very different outcome.</p>

<p>I see the potential of having a public API developer portal where you publish all the digital resources your company offers. Providing self-service registration to access these digital resources at a fair, transparent, and pay for what you use pricing model. I get what this can do for companies when it comes to attracting developer talent to help deliver the applications that are needed for any platform to thrive. I’ve seen the benefits to the end-users of these applications when it comes to giving them control over their data, the ability to leverage 3rd party applications, while also better understanding, managing, and ultimately owning the digital resources they generate each day. I also regularly see how this all can be a serious threat to how some businesses operate, and work to reveal the illnesses that exist within many businesses, and the shady things the occur behind the firewall each day.</p>

<p>I regularly see businesses pay lip service to the concept of APIs, but in reality, are more about locking things up, and slowing things down to their benefit, instead of opening up access, and streamlining anything. I’m not saying that businesses do this by default, and are always being led from the top down to behave this way, I am saying it gets baked into the fabric of how teams, groups, and individuals cells in the overall organizational organism. These cells learn to resist, fight back, appear like they are on board with this latest wave of how we deliver technology, but in reality, they are not interested in the interoperability that APIs bring to the table. There is just too much power, control, and revenue to be generated by locking things up, slowing things down, and making things hard to get.</p>

<p>After eight years of doing this, plus another 22 years of working in the industry, I’m always skeptical of people’s motivation motivation behind doing APIs. Why do you think this resources is important enough to make accessible? Who will get access to this resources? What is the price of this resource? Is pricing observable across all tiers of access? Can we talk about your SLA? Can we talk about your road map? Why are you doing APIs? Who do they benefit? There are so many questions to be asked when getting at the soul of each company’s API efforts. Before you can truly understand if a company is truly interested in the interoperability that APIs bring to the table. Before you can begin to understand what their API journey will involve. Before you understand whether or not you want to do business with a company using their API, and make it something you bake into your own operations and applications.</p>

<p>I write about this only to remind myself that some companies will have other plans. I write about this to remind myself to ask the hard questions of all the organizations I’m engaging with, all along the way. I tend to default to a belief that most people are straight up, and share their real intentions, yet I need a regular reminder that this really isn’t true. Most successful businesses are doing aggressive, shady, and manipulative things to get ahead. The concept of creating the best product, and running a smart business, and you’ll win, is a myth. I’m not saying it doesn’t happen, or can’t happen, I am saying it isn’t the normal mode of the business world–despite popular belief. This is all a reminder that just because a business has APIs, doesn’t mean their belief system around doing APIs reflects my vision, or the popular API community vision around what doing APIs is all about.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2018</span>
        <p>Nobody likes to be told that their APIs are unreliable, and unavailable on a regular basis. However, it is one of those pills that ALL APIs have to swallow, and EVERY API provider should be paying for an external monitoring service to tell us when are APIs are up or down. Having a monitoring service to tell us when our APIs are having problems, complete with a status dashboard, and history of our API's availability are essential building blocks of any API provider. If you expect consumers to use your API, and bake it into their systems and applications, you should committed to a certain level of availability, and offering a service level agreement if possible.</p>

<p>My friends over at APImetrics monitor APIs across multiple industries, but we've been partnering to keep an eye on federal government APIs, in support of my work in DC. They've recently [shared an informative dashboard tracking on the performance of federal government APIs](https://apimetrics.io/us-government-api-performance-dashboard/), providing an interesting view of the government API landscape, and the overall reliability of APIs they provide.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="https://apimetrics.io/us-government-api-performance-dashboard/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apimetrics/api-metrics-federal-government-1.png" width="95%" style="padding: 5px;" /></a></p>

<p>They continue by breaking down the performance of federal government APIs, including how the APIs perform across multiple North American regions across four of the leading cloud providers:</p>

<p align="center"><a href="https://apimetrics.io/us-government-api-performance-dashboard/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apimetrics/api-metrics-federal-government-2.png" width="95%" style="padding: 5px;" /></a></p>

<p>Helping us visualize the availability of federal government APIs for the last seven days, by applying their <a href="https://apimetrics.io/2017/04/21/casc-score/">APImetrics CASC score</a> to each of the federal government APIs, and ranking their overall uptime and availability:</p>

<p>I know it sucks being labeled as one of the worst performing APIs, but you also have the opportunity to be named one the best performing APIs. ;-) This is a subject that many private sector companies struggle with, and the federal government has an extremely poor track record for monitoring their APIs, let alone sharing the information publicly. Facing up to this stuff sucks, and you are forced to answer some difficult questions about your operations, but it is also something can't be ignored away when you have a public API</p>

<p>You can [view the US Government API Performance Dashboard for July 2018 over at APImetrics](https://apimetrics.io/us-government-api-performance-dashboard/). If you work for any of these agencies and would like to have a conversation your API monitoring, testing, and performance strategy, I am happy to talk. I know the APImetrics team are happy to help to, so don't stay in denial about your API performance and availability. Don't be embarrassed. Tackle the problem head on, improve your overall quality of service, and then having an API monitoring and performance dashboard publicly available like this won't hurt nearly as much--it will just be a normal part of operating an API that anyone can depend on.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Aug 2018</span>

<p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/08/24/how-should-teams-be-documenting-their-are-new-and-legacy-apis/">I responded about how teams should be documenting their APIs when they have both legacy and new APIs the other day</a>. I wanted to keep the conversation thread going with an example of one possible API documentation implementation. The best way to deliver API documentation guidance in any organization is to provide a forkable, downloadable example of whatever you are talking about. To help illustrate what I am talking about, I wanted to take one documentation solution, and publish it as a GitHub repository.</p>

<p>I chose to go with a simple OpenAPI 3.0 defined API contract, driving a Swagger UI driven API documentation, hosted using GitHub Pages, and <a href="https://github.com/va-working/openapi-documentation">managed as a GitHub repository</a>. In my story about how teams should be documenting their APIs, I provided several API definition formations, and API documentation options–for this walk-through I wanted to narrow it down to a single combination, providing the minimum(alist) viable options possible using OpenAPI 3.0 and SwaggerUI. Of course, any federal agency implementing such a solution should wrap the documentation with their own branding, similar to the <a href="https://gsa.github.io/prototype-city-pairs-api-documentation/api-docs/">City Pairs API prototype out of GSA</a>, which <a href="http://cfpb.github.io/api/ccdb/">originated over at CFPB</a>.</p>

<p>I used the VA Facilities API definition from the developer.va.gov portal for this sample. Mostly because it was ready to go, and relevant to the VA efforts, but also because it was using OpenAPI 3.0–I think it is worth making sure all API documentation moving forward supports is supporting the latest version of OpenAPI. <a href="https://va-working.github.io/openapi-documentation/">The API documentation is here</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/va-working/openapi-documentation/blob/master/openapi/openapi.json">OpenAPI definition is here</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/va-working/openapi-documentation">Github repository is here</a>, showing what is possible. There are plenty of other things I’d like to see in a baseline API documentation template, but this provides a good first draft for a true minimum viable definition.</p>

<p>The goal with this project is to provide a basic seed that any team could use. Next, I will add in some other building blocks, and implementation a ReDoc, DapperDox, or WSDLDoc version. Providing four separate documentation examples that developers can fork and use to document the APIs they are working on. In my opinion, one or more API documentation templates like this should be available for teams to fork or download and implement within any organization. All API governance guidance like this should have the text describing the policy, as well as one or many examples of the policy being delivered. Hopefully this projects shows an example of this in action.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/08/24/how-should-teams-be-documenting-their-are-new-and-legacy-apis/">providing some guidance the other day on how teams should be documenting their APIs</a>, one of the follow up comments was: “Now we just have to figure out how to get the developers to follow the guidance!” Something that any API leadership and governance team is going to face as they work to implement new policies across their organization. You can craft the best possible guidance for API design, deployment, management, and documentation, but it doesn’t mean anyone is actually going to follow your guidance.</p>

<p>Moving forward API governance within any organization represents the cultural frontline of API operations. Getting teams to learn about, understand, and implement sensible API practices is always easier said than done. You may think your vision of the organizations API future is the right one, but getting other internal groups to buy into that vision will take a significant amount of work. It is something that will take time, resources, and be something that will always be shifting and evolving over time.</p>

<p><strong>Lead By Example</strong><br />
The best way to get developers to follow the minimum viable API documentation guidance being set forth is to do the work for them. Provide templates and blueprints of what you want them to do. Develop, provide, and evolve forkable and downloadable API documentation examples, with simple README checklists of what is expected of them. I’ve published <a href="https://va-working.github.io/openapi-documentation/">a simple example using the VA Facilities API definition published as OpenAPI 3.0 and Swagger UI to Github Pages</a>, with <a href="https://github.com/va-working/openapi-documentation">the entire thing forkable via the Github repository</a>. It is very bare bones example of providing API documentation guidance is a package that can be reused, providing API developers with a working example of what is expected of them.</p>

<p><strong>Make It A Group Effort</strong><br />
To help get API developers on board with the minimum viable API documentation guidance being set forth, I recommend making it a group effort. Recruit help from developers to improve upon API documentation templates provided, and encourage them to extend, evolve, and push forward their individual API documentation implementations. Give API developers a stake in how you define governance for API documentation–not everyone will be up for the task, but you’d be surprised who will raise their hand to contribute if they are asked.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/va-working/api-documentation-guidance-2.png" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p><strong>Provide Incentive Model</strong><br />
This is something that will vary in effectiveness from organization to organization, but consider offering a reward, benefit, perk, or some other incentive to any group who adopts the API documentation guidance. Provide them with praise, and showcase their work. Bring exposure to their work with leadership, and across other groups. Brainstorm creatives ways of incentivizing development groups to get more involved. Establish a list of all development groups, track on ideas for incentivizing their participation and adoption, and work regularly to close them on playing an active role in moving forward your organization’s API documentation strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Punish And Shame Others</strong><br />
As a last resort, for the more badly behaved groups within our organizations, consider punishing and shaming them for not following API documentation guidance, and contributing to overall API governance efforts. This is definitely not something you should not consider doing lightly, and should only be used in special cases, but sometimes teams will need smaller or larger punitive responses to their inaction. Ideally, teams are influenced by praise, and positive examples of why API documentation standards matter, but there will always be situations where teams won’t get on board with the wider organizational API governance efforts, and need their knuckles rapped.</p>

<p><strong>Making Meaningful Change Is Hard</strong><br />
It will not be easy to implement consistent API documentation across any large organization. However, API documentation is often one of the most important stops along the API lifecycle, and should receive significant investment when it comes to API governance efforts. In most situations doing the work for developers, and providing them with blueprints to be successful will accomplish the goal of getting API developers all using a common approach to API documentation. Like any other stop along the API lifecycle, delivering consistent API documentation across distributed teams will take having a coherent strategy, with regular tactical investment to move everything forward in a meaningful way. However, once you get your API documentation house in order, many other stops along the API lifecycle will also begin to fall inline.</p>

<p>We are getting closer to <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/">the 9th edition of APIStrat happening in Nashville, TN this September 24th through 26th</a>. <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/schedule/">The schedule for the conference is up</a>, along with <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/keynote_speakers/">the first lineup of keynote speakers</a>, and my drumbeat of stories about the event continues here on the blog. Next up in our session lineup is <em>“Do Not Miss Internal Developer Portals: Developer Engagement Behind the Firewall”</em> by Kristof Van Tomme (@kvantomme), Pronovix (@pronovix) on September 25th.</p>

<p>Here is Kristof’s abstract for the API session:</p>

<p><em>While there are a lot of talks and blogposts about APIs and the importance of an APIs Developer eXperience, most are about public API products. And while a lot of the best practices for API products are also applicable to private APIs, there are significant differences in the circumstances and trade-offs they need to make.
The most important difference is probably in their budgets: as potential profit centers, API products can afford to invest a lot more money in documentation and UX driven developer portal improvements. Internal APIs rarely have that luxury.</em></p>

<p><em>In this talk I will explain the differences between public and private APIs, introduce upstream DX, and explain how it can improve downstream DX. Introduce experience design (a.k.a. gamification) and Innersourcing (open sourcing practices behind the firewall) and describe how they could be used on internal developer portals.</em></p>

<p>Kristof is an expert in delivering developer portals and API documentation, making his talk a must attend session. <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/attend/register/">You can register for the event here</a>, and there <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/sponsor/">are still sponsorship opportunities available</a>. Don’t miss out on APIStrat this year–it is going to be a good time in Nashville as we continue the conversation we started back in 2012 with the initial edition of the API industry event in New York City.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to seeing you all in Nashville next month!</p>

<p>I’ll let Erik’s bio set the stage for what he’ll be talking about at APIStrat:</p>

<p><em>Erik is a frequent speaker at both industry and academia events. In his current role at the API Academy, his work revolves around API strategy, design, and management, and how to help organizations with their digital transformation. Based on his extensive background in Web architecture and technologies, Erik combines deep expertise in protocols and representations with insights into API practices at today’s organizations.</em></p>

<p><em>Before joining API Academy and working in the API space full-time, Erik spent time at Siemens and EMC, in both cases working at ways how APIs could be used for their internal service ecosystems, as well as for better ways for customers to use services and products. Before that, Erik spent most of his life in academia, working at UC Berkeley and ETH Zürich. Erik received his Ph.D. in computer science from ETH Zürich, and his diploma in computer science from TU Berlin.</em></p>

<p>Erik nows his stuff, and can be found on the road with the CA API Academy, making this stop in Nashville, TN a pretty special opportunity. <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/attend/register/">You can register for the event here</a>, and there <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/sponsor/">are still sponsorship opportunities available</a>.

        <span class="post-date">24 Aug 2018</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope/builder/filtered/23_19_800_500_0_max_0_-5_-1.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>While Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram will always have a place in <a href="https://history.apievangelist.com/">my history of APIs</a>, I feel like we are entering a post Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram API world. All three platforms are going through serious evolutions, which includes tightening down the controls on API access, and shuttering of many APIs. These platforms are tightening things down for a variety of reasons, which are more about their business goals, than it is about the community. I’m not saying these APIs will go away entirely, but the era where where these API platforms ruled is coming to a close.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/08/20/we-need-you-api-developers-until-we-have-grown-to-a-certain-size/">The other day I articulated that these platform only needed us for a while</a>, and now that they’ve grown to a certain size do not need us anymore. While this is true, I know there is more to the story of why we are moving on in the Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram story. We can’t understand the transformation that is occurring without considering that these platform’s business models are playing out, and they (we) are reaping what they’ve sown with their free and open platform business models. It isn’t so much that they are looking to screw over their developers, they are just making another decision, in a long line of decisions to keep generating revenue from their user generated realities, and advertising fueled perception.</p>

<p>I don’t fault Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for fully opening their APIs, then closing them off over time. I fault us consumers for falling for it. I do fault Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram a little for not managing their APIs better along the way, but when your business model is out of alignment with proper API management, it is only natural that you look the other way when bad things are happening, or you are just distracted with other priorities. This is ultimately why you should avoid platforms who don’t have an API, or a clear business model for their platform. There is a reason aren’t having this conversation about Amazon S3 after a decade. With a proper business model, and API management strategy you deal with all the riff raff early on, and along the way–it is how this API game works when you don’t operate a user-exploitative business.</p>

<p>Ultimately, living in a post Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram API world won’t mean much. The world goes on. There will be some damage to the overall API brand, and people will point to these platforms as why you shouldn’t do APIs. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram will still be able to squeeze lots of advertising based revenue out of their platforms. Eventually it will make them vulnerable, and they will begin to lose market share being such a closed off ecosystem, but there will always be plenty of people willing to spend money on their advertising solutions, and believe they are reaching an audience. Developers will find other data source, and APIs to use in the development of web, mobile, and device applications.</p>

<p>The challenge will be making sure that we can spot the API platforms early on who will be using a similar playbook to Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Will we push back on API provides who don’t have clear business models? Will we see the potential damage of purely eyeball based, advertising fueled platform growth? Will we make sound decisions in the APIs we adopt, or will we continue to just jump on whatever bandwagon that comes along, and willfully become sharecroppers on someone else’s farm. Will we learn from this moment, and what has happened in the last decade of growth for some of the most significant API platforms across the landscape today?</p>

<p>To help paint a proper picture of this problem, let me frame another similar situation that is not the big bad Twitter and Facebook, that everyone loves bashing on. Medium. I remember everyone telling me in 2014 that I should move API Evangelist to Medium – I kicked the tires, but they didn’t have an API. A no go for me. Eventually they launched a read only API, and I began syndicating a handful of my stories there. I enjoyed some network effect. I would have scaled upon my engagement if there was write access to APIs, as well as other platform related data like my followers. I never moved my blog to Blogger, Tumblr, Posterous, or Medium, for all the same reasons. I don’t want to be trapped on any platform, and I saw the signs early on with Medium, and managed to avoid  any frustration as they go through their current evolution.</p>

<p>I don’t use the Facebook API for much–it just isn’t my audience. I do use Twitter for a lot. I depend on Twitter for a lot of traffic and exposure. I would say the same for LinkedIn and Github. LinkedIn has been closing off their APIs for some time, but honestly it was never something that was ever very open. I worry about Github, especially after the Microsoft acquisition. However, I went into my Github relationship expecting it to be temporary, and because all my data is in a machine readable and portable format, I’m not worried about every having to migrate–I can’t do this with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn. I’m saddened to think about a post Twitter API world, where every API call is monetized, and there is no innovation in the community. It is coming though. It will be slow. We won’t notice much of it. But, it is happening.</p>

<p>I know that Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram all think they are making the best decision for their business, and investors. I know they also think that they’ve done the best job they could have under the circumstances over the last decade. You did, within the vision of the world you had established. You didn’t for your communities. If Facebook and Twitter had been more strict and organized about API application reviews from early days, and had structured access tiers of free, as well as paid access early on, a lot fewer people would be complaining as you made those processes, and access tiers more strict. It is just that you didn’t manage anything for so long, and once the bad things happening began effecting the platform bottom line, and worrying investors, then you began managing your API.</p>

<p>I know that Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram all think they will be fine. They will. However, over time they will become the next NBC, AOL, or other relic of the past. They will lose their soul, if they ever had one. And everyone on the Internet will be somewhere else, giving away their digital bits for free. This same platform model will play out over and over again in different incarnations, and the real test will be if we ever care? Will we keep investing in these platforms, building out their integrations, attracting new users, and keeping them engaged. Or, will we work to strike a balance, and raise the bar which platforms we sign up for, and ultimately depend on as part of our daily lives. I’m done getting pissed off about what Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram do, I”m more focused on evaluating and ranking all the digital platforms I depend on, and turn up or down the volume, based upon the signals they send me about what the future will hold.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Aug 2018</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope/builder/filtered/109_214_800_500_0_max_0_1_-1.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’m continuing my work to help <a href="https://developer.va.gov/">the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) move forward their API strategy</a>. One area I’m happy to help the federal agency with, is just being available to answer  questions, which I also find make for great stories here on the blog–helping other federal agencies also learn along the way. One question I got from the agency recently, is regarding how the teams should be documenting their APIs, taking into consideration that many of them are supporting legacy services like SOAP.</p>

<p>From my vantage point, minimum viable API documentation should always include a machine readable definition, and some autogenerated documentation within a portal at a known location. If it is a SOAP service, WSDL is the format. If it is REST, OpenAPI (fka Swagger) is the format. If its XML RPC, you can bend OpenAPI to work. If it is GraphQL, it should come with its own definitions. All of these machine readable definitions should exist within a known location, and used as the central definition for the documentation user interface. Documentation should not be hand generated anymore with the wealth of open source API documentation available.</p>

<p>Each service should have its own GitHub/BitBucket/GitLab repository with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>README</strong> - Providing a concise title and description for the service, as well as links to all documentation, definitions, and other resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Definitions</strong> - Machine readable API definitions for the APIs underlying schema, and the surface area of the API.</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Autogenerated documentation for the API, driven by its machine readable definition.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the type of API being deployed and managed, there should be one or more of these definition formats in place:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Web Services Description Language (WSDL)</strong> - The XML-based interface definition used for describing the functionality offered by the service.</li>
  <li><strong>OpenAPI</strong> - The YAML or JSON based OpenAPI specification format managed by the OpenAPI Initiative as part of the Linux Foundation.</li>
  <li><strong>JSON Schema</strong> - The vocabulary that allows for the annotation and validation of the schema for the service being offered–it is part of OpenAPI specification as well.</li>
  <li><strong>Postman Collections</strong> - JSON based specification format created and maintained by the Postman client and development environment.</li>
  <li><strong>API Blueprint</strong> - The markdown based API specification format created and maintained by the Apiary API design environment, now owned by Oracle.</li>
  <li><strong>RAML</strong> - The YAML based API specification format created and maintained by Mulesoft.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, OpenAPI / JSON Schema is established as the primary format for defining the contract for each API, but teams should also be able to stick with what they were given (legacy), and run with the tools they’ve already purchased (RAML &amp; API Blueprint), and <a href="https://apimatic.io/transformer">convert between specifications using API Transformer</a>.</p>

<p>API documentation should be published to it’s GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket repository, and hosted using one of the service static project site solutions with one of the following open source documentation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/"><strong>Swagger UI</strong></a> - Open source API documentation driven by OpenAPI.</li>
  <li><a href="https://rebilly.github.io/ReDoc/"><strong>ReDoc</strong></a> - Open source API documentation driven by <strong>OpenAPI</strong>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://raml.org/developers/document-your-api">RAML</a> - Open source API documentation driven by RAML.</li>
  <li><a href="http://dapperdox.io/"><strong>DapperDox</strong></a> - DapperDox is Open-Source, and provides rich, out-of-the-box, rendering of your OpenAPI specifications, seamlessly combined with your GitHub flavoured Markdown documentation, guides and diagrams.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/davidluckystar/wsdldoc"><strong>wsdldoc</strong></a> - The tool can be used to generate HTML documentation out of WSDL file.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other open source solutions available for auto-generating API documentation using the core API’s definition, but these represent some of the commonly used solutions out there today. Depending on the solution being used to deploy or manage an API, there might be built-in, ready to go options for deploying documentation based upon the OpenAPI, WSDL, RAML or other using AWS API Gateway, Mulesoft, or other existing vendor solution already in place to support API operations.</p>

<p>Even with all this effort, a repository, with a machine readable API definition, and autogenerated documentation still doesn’t provide enough of a baseline for API teams to follow. Each API documentation should possess the following within those building blocks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Title and Description</strong> - Provide the concise description of what an API does from the README, and make sure it is based into the APIs definition.</li>
  <li><strong>Base URL</strong> - Have the base URL, or variable representation for a base URL present in API definitions.</li>
  <li><strong>Base Path</strong> - Provide any base path that is constant across paths available for any single API.</li>
  <li><strong>Content Types</strong> - List what content types an API accepts and returns as part of its operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Paths</strong> - List all available paths for an API, with summary and descriptions, making sure the entire surface area of an API is documented.</li>
  <li><strong>Parameters</strong> - Provide details on the header, path, and query parameters used for API path being documented.</li>
  <li><strong>Body</strong> - Provide details on the schema for the body of each API path that accepts a body as part of its operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Responses</strong> - Provide HTTP status code and reference to the schema being returned for each path.</li>
  <li><strong>Examples</strong> - Provide example requests and response for each API path being documented.</li>
  <li><strong>Schema</strong> - Document all schema being used as part of requests and responses for all APIs paths being documented.</li>
  <li><strong>Authentication</strong> - Document the authentication method used (ie. Basic Auth, Keys, OAuth, JWT).</li>
</ul>

<p>If EVERY API possesses its own repository, and README to get going, guiding all API consumers to complete, up to date, and informative documentation that is auto-generated, a significant amount of friction during the on-boarding process can be eliminated. Additionally, friction at the time of hand-off for any service from on team to another, or one vendor to another, will be significantly reduced–with all relevant documentation available within the project’s repository.</p>

<p>API documentation delivered in this way provides a single known location for any human to go when putting an API to work. It also provides a single known location to find a machine readable definition that can be used to on-board using an API client like <a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>, <a href="http://luckymarmot.com/paw">PAW</a>, or <a href="http://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a>. The API definition provides the contract for the API documentation, but it also provides what is needed across other stops along the API lifecycle, like monitoring, testing, SDK generation, security, and client integration–reducing the friction across many stops along the API journey.</p>

<p>This should provide a baseline for API documentation across teams. No matter how big or small the API, or how new or old the API is. Each API should have API documentation available in a consistent, and usable way. Providing a human and programmatic way for understanding what an API does, that can be use to on-board and maintain integrations with each application. The days of PDF and static API documentation are over, and the baseline for each APIs documentation always involves having a machine readable contract as the core, and managing the documentation as part of the pipeline used to deploy and manage the rest of the API lifecycle.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Aug 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/postman/postman-environments.png" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’m a big fan of <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>, and the power of their development environment, as well as their Postman Collection format. I think their approach to not just integrating with APIs, but also enabling the development and delivery of APIs has shifted the conversation around APIs in the last couple of years–not too many API service providers accomplish this in my experience. There are several dimensions to what Postman does that I think are pushing the API conversation forward, but one that has been capturing my attention lately <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/environments_and_globals/manage_environments">are Postman Environment Files</a>.</p>

<p>Using Postman, you can manage many different environments used for working with APIs, and if you are a pro or enterprise customer, you can export a file that represents an environment, making each of these API definitions more portable and collaborative. Managing the variety of environments for the hundreds of APIs I use is one of the biggest pain points I have. Postman has significantly helped me get a handle on the tokens and keys I use across the internal, as well as partner and public APIs that I depend on each day to operate API Evangelist.</p>

<p>Postman environments allows me to define environments within the Postman application, and then share them as part of the pro / enterprise team experience. <a href="https://docs.api.getpostman.com/#a237ffbe-0444-b394-a2c4-b99f691931cf">You can also manage your environments through the Postman API</a>, if you need to more deeply integrate with your operations. The Postman Environment File makes all of this portable, sharable, and used across environments. It is one of the reasons that makes Postman Collections more valuable to some users, in specific contexts, because it has that run time aspect to what it does. Postman let’s you communicate effectively around the APIs you are deploying and integrating with, and solves relevant pain points like API environment management, that can stand in the way of integration.</p>

<p>There aren’t many features of API service providers I get very excited about, but the potential of Postman as an environment management solution is significant. If Postman is able to establish itself as the broker of credentials at the API environment level, it will give them a significant advantage of other service providers. With the size of their developer base, having visibility at the environment level puts their finger on the pulse of what is going on in the API economy, from both an API provider and consumer perspective. With Postman Environment Files acting as a sort of key, or currency, that has to exist before any API transaction can be executed. And, as the number of APIs we depend on increases, the importance of having a strategy (and solution) for managing our environment will grow exponentially–putting Postman in a pretty sweet position.</p>

<p>I do not like email. I do not have a good relationship with my inbox. However, it is one of those ubiquitous tools I have to use, and understand the value it can bring to my world. The goal is to not let my inbox control me too much, as my it is is often a task list that other people think they can control. With all that said, I’m finding renewed value in email newsletters, on several fronts. While I’d prefer to get updates via Atom, I’m warming up to receiving updates from API providers, and API service providers in my inbox.</p>

<p>I am an active subscriber to the <a href="https://tinyletter.com/RESTAPINotes/">REST API Notes Newsletter</a>, <a href="https://apideveloperweekly.com/">API Developer Weekly</a>, and other relative newsletters. I’m also finding myself opening up more emails from the API providers, and service providers I’m registered with. Historically, I often see email as a nuisance, but I’m beginning to see emails from the companies I’m paying attention to as a healthy signal. Increasingly, it is a signal that I’m using to understand the overall health of a platform, and yet another signal that will go silent when a platform isn’t supporting their user base, and potentially running out of funding for their operations.</p>

<p>I recently wrote a script that harvests emails from my inbox, and tracks on the communications occurring with API providers and service providers I am monitoring. At it’s most basic, it is a heartbeat that I can use to tell when an API provider or service provider is still alive. After that, I’m looking at harvest URLs, and other data, and use the signals to float an API provider or service provider up on my list. It can be tough to remember to tune into what is going on across hundreds and thousands of APIs, and any signal I can harvest to help companies float up is a positive thing. Hopefully it is something that will also incentivize API provider and service providers to tell more stories via email, as well as their blog and social media.</p>

<p>Email is still one of my least favorite signals out there, but I’m beginning to realize there is still a lot of value to be found within my inbox. Having a regular newsletter is something I’m going to write about more, encouraging more API providers and service providers to provide. I think more companies, institutions, and government agencies feel comfortable telling stories via email, over a public blog. It may not be my preferred medium of choice, but I know that it takes a diverse set of channels to reach a large audience, and who am I to only use the ones I like the most.</p>

<p>We are getting closer to <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/">the 9th edition of APIStrat happening in Nashville, TN this September 24th through 26th</a>. <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/schedule/">The schedule for the conference is up</a>, along with <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/keynote_speakers/">the first lineup of keynote speakers</a>, and my drumbeat of stories about the event continues here on the blog. Next up in our session lineup is <em>“Any Way You Want It: Extending Swagger UI for Fun and Profit”</em> by Kyle Shockey (@kyshoc) of SmartBear Software (@SmartBear) on September 25th.</p>

<p>Here is Kyle’s abstract for the session:</p>

<p><em>Your APIs are tailored to your needs - shouldn’t your tools be as well? In this talk, we’ll explore how Swagger UI 3 makes it easier than ever to create custom functionality, and common use cases for the power that the UI’s plugin system provides.</em></p>

<p><em>Learn how to:</em></p>

<p><em>- Create plugins that extend existing features and define new functionality</em>
<em>- Integrate Swagger UI seamlessly by defining a custom layout</em>
<em>- Package and share plugins that can be reused by the community (or your organization)</em></p>

<p>Swagger UI has changed the conversation around how we document our APIs, and being able to extend the interface is an important part of keeping the API documentation conversation evolving, and APIStrat is where this type of discussion is happening. <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/attend/register/">You can register for the event here</a>, and there <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/sponsor/">are still sponsorship opportunities available</a>. Don’t miss out on APIStrat this year–it is going to be a good time in Nashville as we continue the conversation we started back in 2012 with the initial edition of the API industry event in New York City.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to seeing you all in Nashville next month!</p>

<p><em>Laura will be talking about tooling for mocking microservice endpoints in a meaningful way using Open API specifications. She will cover how to set up microservice deployments processes so that with each versioned microservice deployed a mock of the service with up to date contracts will also be deployed. Laura will also show how to use tooling she and her team built to consume these lightweight mocks in unit tests and either get default mock responses or mock out custom responses for different test cases.</em></p>

<p>In an era where many API development groups are working to move to a design and mock first approach, this session will be key to our journey, and APIStrat is where we all need to be. <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/attend/register/">You can register for the event here</a>, and there <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/sponsor/">are still sponsorship opportunities available</a>.

        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories-new/cityscape_copper_circuit.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’m evolving <a href="http://api.gallery.streamdata.io/">the search for the Streamdata.io API Gallery</a> I’ve been working on lately. I’m looking to move the basic keywords search that searches the API name and description, as well as the API path, summary, and description using a key word or phrase, to also be about searching parameters in a meaningful way. Each of the APIs in the Streamdata.io API have an OpenAPI definition. It is how I render each of the individual API paths using Jekyll and Github Pages. These parameters give me another dimension of data in which I can index, and use as a facet in my API gallery search.</p>

<p>I am developing different sets of vocabulary to help me search against the parameters used across APIs, with one of them being focused on company related information. I’m trying to find APIs that provide the ability to add, update, and search against company related data, content, and execute algorithms that help make sense of company resources. There is no perfect way to search for API parameters that touch on company resources, but right now I’m looking for a handful of fields: <em>company, organization, business, enterprise, agency, ticker, corporate, and employer</em>. Returning APIs that have a parameter with any of those words in the path or summary, and weighting differently if it is in the description or tags for each API path.</p>

<p>Next, I’m also tagging each API path that has a URL field, because this will allow me to connect the dot to a company, organization, or other entity via the domain. This is all I’m trying to do, is connect the dots using the parameter structure of an API. I find that there is an important story being told at the API design layer, and API search and discovery is how we are going to bring this story out. Connecting the dots at the corporate level is just one of many interesting stories out there, just waiting to be told. Pushing forward the conversation around how we understand the corporate digital landscape, and what resources they have available.</p>

<p><a href="http://api.gallery.streamdata.io/">You can do a basic API search at the bottom of the Streamdata.io API Gallery main page</a>. I do not have my parameter search available publicly yet. I want to spend more time refining my vocabularies, and also look at searching the request and response bodies for each path–I’m guessing this won’t be as straightforward, as parameters has been. Right now I’m immersed in understanding the words we use to design our APIs, and craft our API documentation. It is fascinating to see how people describe their resources, and how they think (or don’t think) about making these resources available to other people. OpenAPI definitions provide a fascinating way to look at how APIs are opening up access to company information, establishing the digital vocabulary for how we exchange data and content, and apply algorithms to help us better understand the business world around us.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories-new/69_120_800_500_0_max_0_1_-1.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>Last year I started saying API define first, instead of API design first. In response to many of the conversations out there about designing, then mocking, and eventually deploying your APIs into a production environment. I agree that you should design and iterate before writing code, but I feel like we should be defining our APIs even before we get to the API design phase. Without the proper definitions on the table, our design phase is going to be a lot more deficient in standards, common patterns, goals, and objectives, making it important to invest some energy in defining what is happening first–then iterate on the API definitions throughout the API lifecycle, not just design.</p>

<p>I prefer to have a handful of API definitions drafted, before I move onto to the API design phase:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Title</strong> - A simple, concise title for my API.</li>
  <li><strong>Description</strong> - A simple, concise description for my API.</li>
  <li><strong>JSON Schema</strong> - A set of JSON schema for my APIs</li>
  <li><strong>OpenAPI</strong> - An OpenAPI for the surface area of my API.</li>
  <li><strong>Assertions</strong> - A list of what my API should be delivering.</li>
  <li><strong>Standards</strong> - What standards are being applied with this API.</li>
  <li><strong>Patterns</strong> - What common web patterns will be used with this API.</li>
  <li><strong>Goals</strong> - What are the goals for this particular API.</li>
</ul>

<p>I like having all of this in a GitHub repository before I get to work, actually designing my APIs. It provides me with the base set of definitions I need to go to be as effective as I can in my API design phase. Of course, each of these definitions will be iterated, added to, and evolved as part of the API design phase, and beyond. The goal is to just get a base set of building blocks on the workbench, properly setting the tone for what my API will be doing. Grounding my API work early on in the API lifecycle, in a consistent way that I can apply across many different APIs.</p>

<p>The problem with all of this, is that it is easier said than done. I still like to hand code my APIs. It is something I’ve been doing for 20 years, and it is a habit that is hard to kick. When designing an API, often times I do not know what is possible, and I need to hack on the solution for a while. I need to hack on and massage some data, content, or push forward my algorithm a little. All of this has to happen before I can articulate the interface will look like. Sure, I might have some basic RESTful notions about what API paths will be, and the schema I’ve gathered will drive some of the conversation, but I still need to hack together a little goodness, before I can design.</p>

<p>This is ok. With some APIs I will be able to define and then design without ever touching any code. While others I will still have to prototype at least a function to prove the concept behind the API. Once I have the proof of concept, then I can start crafting a sensible interface using OpenAPI, then mock, and work with the concept a little more within an API design phase. Ultimately, I do not think there is any RIGHT WAY to develop an API. I think there are healthier, and less healthier ways. I think there are more hardened, and proven ways, but I also think there should be experimental, and even legacy ways of doing things. My goal is to always make sure the process is as sensible and pragmatic as it can be, while meeting the immediate, and long term business goals of my company, as well as my partners.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2018</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope/builder/filtered/97_193_800_500_0_max_0_-5_-1.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>APIs come in many shapes and sizes. Even when APIs may share a common resource, the likelihood that they are similar in functional, will be slim. Even after eight years of studying APIs, I still struggle with understanding the differences, and putting APIs into common buckets. Think of the differences between two image APIs like Flickr and Instagram, but then also think about the difference between Twitter and Twilio–the differences are many, and a challenge to articulate.</p>

<p>I’m pushing forward <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack</a>, and <a href="http://api.gallery.streamdata.io/">API Gallery work</a>, and I’m needing to better organize APIs into meaningful groups that I can add to the search functionality for each of API discovery services. To help me establish a handful of new buckets, I’m thinking more critically about the different types of API functionality I’m coming across, establishing seven new buckets:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>General Data</strong> - You can get at data across the platform, users, and resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Relative Data</strong> - You can get at data that is relative to a user, company, or specific account.</li>
  <li><strong>Static Data</strong> - The data doesn’t change too often, and will always remain fairly constant.</li>
  <li><strong>Evolving Data</strong> - The data changes on a regular basis, providing a reason to come back often.</li>
  <li><strong>Historical Data</strong> - Provides access to historical data, going back an X number of. years.</li>
  <li><strong>Service</strong> - The API is offered as a service, or is provided to extend a specific service.</li>
  <li><strong>Algorithmic</strong> - The API provides some sort of algorithmic functionality like ML, or otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Understanding the type of data an API provides is important to the work I’m doing. Streamdata.io caters to the needs of financial organizations, and they are looking for data to help them with their investment portfolio, but also have very particular opinions around the type of data they want. This first version of my API type list is heavily weighted towards data, but as I evolve in my thinking, I’m guessing the service and algorithmic buckets will expand and evolve as well.</p>

<p>The APIs I am cataloging within this work spring fit into one or many of these buckets. They are meant to transcend the resource being made available, and the provider behind the service. I want to be able to search, filter, and organize APIs across many of the usual characteristics we use to track on. I’m wanting to go beyond the obvious resource focused characteristics, and move beyond the technology being applied. I’m looking to understand what you can do with an API, and be able to stack hundreds, or thousands of similar APIs side by side, and provide a new view of the landscape.</p>

<p>We are getting closer to <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/">the 9th edition of APIStrat happening in Nashville, TN this September 24th through 26th</a>. <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/schedule/">The schedule for the conference is up</a>, along with <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/keynote_speakers/">the first lineup of keynote speakers</a>, and my drumbeat of stories about the event continues here on the blog. Next up in our session lineup is <em>“Describing Your API with OpenAPI 3.0”</em> by Anthony Eden (@aeden), DNSimple (@dnsimple) on September 25th.</p>

<p>Here is Christian’s abstract for the session:</p>

<p><em>For the last 10 years, DNSimple has operated a comprehensive web API for buying, connecting, and operating domain names. After hearing about OpenAPI at APIStrat 2017, we decided to describe the DNSimple API using the OpenAPI v3 specification - this is the story of why we did it, how we did it, and where we are today.</em></p>

<p><em>By the end of this presentation you will have the tools you’ll need to evaluate your own API and decide if implementing OpenAPI makes sense for you, and if so, how you can get started. You’ll have a better understanding of the tools available to you to help write your OpenAPI 3 definition, as well the basics on how to write your own definition for your APIs.</em></p>

<p>We are all still working to make the switch from OpenAPI 2.0 to 3.0, and with APIStrat being owned and operated by the OpenAPI Initiative, it will definitely be the place to have face to face discussions that influence the road map for the API specification. <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/attend/register/">You can register for the event here</a>, and there <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/sponsor/">are still sponsorship opportunities available</a>. Don’t miss out on APIStrat this year–it is going to be a good time in Nashville as we continue the conversation we started back in 2012 with the initial edition of the API industry event in New York City.</p>

<p>I was working on <a href="https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:879370021840:applications~StreamData-IO-Hacker-News-New">a serverless app for Streamdata.io that takes posts to Hacker News and streams them into an Amazon S3 data lake</a>, and I came across the <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/api">Algolia powered Hacker News search API</a>. After being somewhat frustrated with the simplicity of the official Hacker News API, I was pleased to find <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/api">the search kindly provided by Algolia</a>.</p>

<p>There is no search API available for the core Hacker News API, and the design leaves a lot to be desired, so the simplicity of Algolia’s API solution was refreshing. There is a lot of data flowing into Hacker News on a regular day, so providing a search API is pretty critical. Additionally,  Algolia’s ability to deliver such a simple, usable, yet powerful API on top of a relevant data source like Hacker News demonstrates the utility of what Algolia offers as a search solution–something I wanted to take a moment to point out here on the blog.</p>

<p>I consider search to be an essential ingredient for any API. Every API should have a search element to their stack, allowing the indexing and searching of all API resources through a single path. Making Algolia a relevant API service provider in this area, enabling API providers to outsource the indexing and searching of their resources, and the delivery of a dead simple API for your consumers to tap into. This path forward is probably not for every API, as many weave specialized search throughout their API design, but for teams who are lacking in resources, and can afford to outsource this element–Algolia makes sense.</p>

<p>Seeing Algolia in action, for a specific API I was integrating with helped bring their service front and center for me. I tend to showcase Elastic for deploying API search solutions, but it is a good to receive a regular reminder that Algolia does the same thing as a service. Their work on the Hacker News Search API provides a good example of they can do for you–sure, we can all build our own search solutions, but honestly, do you have the time? I’ll make sure and regularly highlight what Algolia is doing as part of <a href="http://search.apievangelist.com">my search API research</a>, and thanks Algolia! I really appreciate what you did for <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/api">the Hacker News API</a>, it made my work a lot easier.</p>

<p>I’m watching several fronts along the API landscape evolve right now, with large API providers shifting, shutting down, and changing how they do business with their APIs–now that they don’t need their ecosystem of developers as much. It is easy to point the finger at Facebook, Twitter, Google, and the other giants, but it really is a wider systemic, business of APIs illness that will continue to negatively impact the API universe. While this behavior is very prominent with the leading API providers right now, it is something we’ll see various waves of it’s influence on the tone of the entire API sector further on down the road.</p>

<p>How API providers treat their consumers vary from industry to industry, and is different depending on the types of resources being made available. However, the issue of API providers treating their developers differently when they are just getting started versus once they grow to a certain size, is something that will continue to plague all areas of the API space. Companies change as they mature, and their priorities will no doubt evolve, but almost all will feel compelled to exploit developers early on so that they can grow their numbers–taking advantage of the goodwill and curiosity of the developer personality.</p>

<p>The polarization of the API management layer is difficult to predict from the outside. I want to help new API providers out early on, but after eight years of doing this, and seeing many API providers and service providers evolve, and go away–I am left very skeptical of EVERYONE. I think many developers in the API space are feeling the same, and are weary of kicking the tires on new APIs, unless they have a specific project and purpose. I think the days of developers working for free within an API ecosystem are over. It is a concept that will still exist in some form, but along with each wave of new API startups taking advantage of this reality, then tightening things down later on down the road, eventually developers will change their behavior in response.</p>

<p>The lesson is that if a API doesn’t have a clear business model early on–steer clear of their services. We can’t fault Twitter for working to monetize their platform now, and make their investors happy. We just should have seen it in the cards back in 2008. We can’t fault Facebook for working to please their shareholders, and protect their warehouse of inventory (Facebook Users) from malicious ecosystem players, we just should have seen this coming back in 2008. We can’t fault Google Maps for raising the prices on their digital assets developed by us giving them our data for the last decade, we should have know this would happen back in 2006. The business and politics of APIs is less straightforward than the technology of APIs is, and as we all know, the technology is a mess.</p>

<p>I will keep calling out the offenses of API providers when feel strongly enough, but I’ve ranted about Facebook, Twitter, and Google a lot in the past. I feel like we should be skeptical of ALL API providers at this point, and assume the worst about them all–new or old. Expect them to change the prices down the road. Expect them to turn off the most valuable resources once we’ve helped them grow and mature them into a prized digital asset. This is how some companies will continue to think they can make their investments grow, and all of as API providers and consumers need to remain skeptical about our role in this process. Always making sure we remember that most API providers will no longer need us developers once they have grown to a certain size.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Aug 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/aws-marketplace-aws-saas-seller-integration-guide.png" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I am setting up different APIs using the AWS API Gateway and then publishing them to the AWS Marketplace, as part of <a href="http://streamdata.io">my work with Streamdata.io</a>. I’m getting a feel for what the process is all about, and how small I can distill an API product to be, as part of the AWS Marketplace process. My goal is to be able to quickly define APIs using OpenAPI, then publish them to AWS API Gateway, and leverage the gateway to help me manage the entire business of the service from signup to discovery.</p>

<p>As I was adding one of my first couple of APIs to the AWS Marketplace, and I found the instructions regarding the redirect URL for each API to be a good template. Each individual API service I’m offering will have its own subscription confirmation URL with the AWS API marketplace, with the relevant variables present I will need to scale the technical and business of delivering my APIs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>AWS Marketplace Confirmation Redirect URL:</strong> https://YOUR_DEVELOPER_PORTAL_API_ID.execute-api.[REGION].amazonaws.com/prod/marketplace-confirm/[USAGE_PLAN_ID]</li>
</ul>

<p>This URL is what my retail customers will be given after they click to subscribe to one of my APIs. Each API has its specific portal (present in URL), as well as being associated with a specific API usage plan within AWS API Gateway. Also notice that they have a variable for region, allowing me to deliver services by region, and scale up the technical side of delivering the various APIs I’m deploying–another important consideration when delivering reliable and performant services.</p>

<p>Pointing out the URL for a signup process might seem like a small thing. However, because of AWS’s first mover advantage in the cloud, and their experience as an API pioneer, I feel like they are in a unique position to be defining the business layer of delivering APIs at scale in the cloud. The business opportunities available at the API management and marketplace layers within the AWS ecosystem are untapped, and represent the next generation of API management that is baked into the cloud. It’s an interesting place to be delivering and integrating with APIs, at this stage of the API economy.</p>

<p>We are getting closer to <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/">the 9th edition of APIStrat happening in Nashville, TN this September 24th through 26th</a>. <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/schedule/">The schedule for the conference is up</a>, along with <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/keynote_speakers/">the first lineup of keynote speakers</a>, and my drumbeat of stories about the event continues here on the blog. Next up in our session lineup is <em>“Microservice’ing Like a Unicorn With Envoy, Istio and Kubernetes”</em> by Christian Posta (@christianposta), Red Hat @RedHat on September 25th.</p>

<p>Here is Christian’s abstract for the session:</p>

<p><em>The exciting parts of APIs, unfortunately, happen when services actually try communicating and working together to accomplish some business function. The service-mesh approach has emerged to help make service communication boring. In particular, a project named Istio.io has garnered attention in the open-source community as a way of implementing the service mesh capabilities. These capabilities include pushing application-networking concerns down into the infrastructure: things like retries, load balancing, timeouts, deadlines, circuit breaking, mutual TLS, service discovery, distributed tracing and others.</em></p>

<p><em>As Istio becomes more popular and widely used, we’re going to see a lot of people put it into production for their API use cases. This talk will walk attendees through the Istio architecture, and more importantly, help them understand how it all works.</em></p>

<p>API delivery, integration, orchestration, and development of mesh networks all represent the next generation of doing APIs, and APIStrat is where we are having these discussions. <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/attend/register/">You can register for the event here</a>, and there <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/sponsor/">are still sponsorship opportunities available</a>. Don’t miss out on APIStrat this year–it is going to be a good time in Nashville as we continue the conversation we started back in 2012 with the initial edition of the API industry event in New York City.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to seeing you all in Nashville next month!</p>

<p>The API providers I talk to regularly are rarely proactive when it comes to addressing API deprecation. Most API providers aren’t thinking about shutting down any service they deliver until they’ve actually encountered the need down the road. Many just begin their API journey, assuming their APIs will be a success, and they will have to support every version forever. However, once they encounter what it will take to support older versions, they begin to change their tune, something that often comes as an unexpected surprise to consumers.</p>

<p>Shutting down old APIs will never be easy, but the process can be made easier with a little proactive communication. One example of this practice in action can be found over at <a href="https://developers.evrythng.com/docs/deprecation">the Internet of Things provider Evrythng, with their API deprecation page</a>. Which provides a pretty simple layout for an API deprecation page, beyond just a title and description of what the future might hold.</p>

<p><em>API Status</em></p>

<p><em>The following status labels are applicable to APIs, features, or SDK versions depending on their current support status:</em></p>

<p>_- Preview - May change at any time.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stable - Fully released and stable. Will not change at short notice.</li>
  <li>Deprecated - No longer supported (and may have been replaced), and may be removed in the future at an announced date. Use not encouraged.</li>
  <li>Removed - Removed, and no longer supported or available._</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Communication</em></p>

<p><em>When a deprecation is announced, the details and any relevant migration information will be available on the following channels:</em></p>

<p>_- The Developer Blog.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The @evrythngdev Twitter account.</li>
  <li>The relevant feature page on the Developer Hub.</li>
  <li>Enterprise customers may receive information by email to their specified EVRYTHNG contact, if applicable._</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Customers using one our SLAs can read <a href="https://evrythng.com/legal/sla/">the General section</a> for more information.</em></p>

<p>Evrythng provides us with some important building blocks for using as part of our overall API deprecation strategy. Something that EVERY API provide should be considering as they prepare to launch a new API. API deprecation shouldn’t be an afterthought, and if we communicate open and honestly about it from the beginning, our API consumers will be more forgiving. Surprising consumers down the road is the quickest way to piss people off, and get the tech blogosphere publishing those pitchfork and torches type of stories we see so often about API providers.</p>

<p>I just finished sharing some API deprecation awareness as part of the API strategy for a federal government agency–they just hadn’t had an open discussion about it. API deprecation is one of those uncomfortable subjects, we all have to get used to discussing early on, whether we like it or not. It is something that will always be difficult, and leave some API consumers unhappy, but if done well, it can help reduce a lot of friction. You can visit <a href="http://deprecation.apievangelist.com/">my API deprecation research and storytelling</a> for more examples of how to do it right, and how you can avoid doing it wrong–bringing this important subject out into the open.</p>

<p>I look at a lot of APIs. I can tell a lot about a company, and the people behind an API from looking at their developer portal, documentation, and other building blocks of their presence. One of the more egregious sins I feel an API provider can make when operating their API is publishing their API documentation as a PDF. This is something that was acceptable up until about 2006, but over a decade after it shows that the organization behind an API hasn’t done their homework.</p>

<p>The crime really isn’t the fact that an API provider is using a PDF for their documentation. I’m fine with API providers publishing a PDF version of their API, to provide a portable version of it. Where a PDF version of the documentation becomes a problem is when it is the primary version of the documentation, which demonstrates that the creators don’t get out much and haven’t used many other APIs. If an API team has done their homework, actually put other 3rd party APIs to work, they would know that PDF documentation for APIs is not the norm out in the real world.</p>

<p>One of the strongest characteristics an API provider can possess, is an awareness of what other API providers are doing. The leading API providers demonstrate that they’ve used other APIs, and are aware of what API consumers in the mainstream are used to. Most mainstream API consumers will simply close the tab when they encounter an API that has a PDF document for their API. Unless you have some sort of mandate to use that particular API, you are going to look elsewhere. If an API provider isn’t up to speed on what the norms are for API documentation, and are outwardly facing, the chance they’ll actively support their API is always diminished.</p>

<p>PDF API documentation may not seem like too big of a mistake to many enterprise, institutional, and government API providers, but it demonstrates much more than just a static representation of what an API can do. It represents an isolated, self-contained, non-interactive view of what an API can do. It reflects an API platform that is self-centered, and not really concerned with the outside world. Which often means it is an API platform that won’t always care about you, the API consumer. APIs in the age of the web are all about having an externalized view of the world, and understanding how to play nicely with large groups of developers outside of your firewall–when you publish a PDF version of your API docs, you demonstrate that you don’t get out much, and aren’t concerned with the outside world.</p>

<p>I spend time reviewing each wave of data API marketplaces as they emerge on the landscape every couple of years. There are a number of reasons why these data marketplaces exist, ranging from supporting government agencies, NGOs, or for commercial purposes. One of the most common elements of API-driven data marketplaces that frustrates me is when they don’t do the hard work to expose the meta data around the databases, datasets, spreadsheets, and the raw data they are providing access to–making it very difficult to actually discover anything of interest.</p>

<p>You can see a couple examples of this with <a href="https://docs.mlab.com/data-api/#list-databases">mLab</a>, <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.resources.api">World Health Organization</a>, <a href="https://apidocs.data.world/api">Data.World</a>, and others. While these platforms provide (sometimes) impressive ability to manage data stores, but they don’t always do a good job exposing the meta data of their catalogs as part of the available APIs. Dynamically generating API endpoints, documentation, and other resources based upon the data that is being published to their platforms. Leaving developers to do the digging, and making the investment to understand what is available on a platform.</p>

<p>Some of the platforms I encounter obfuscate their data metadata on purpose, requiring developers to qualified before they get access to valuable resources. Most I think, just do not put themselves in the position of an API consumer who lands on their developer page, and doesn’t know anything about an API. They understand the database, and the API, so it all makes sense to them, and they don’t have any empathy for anyone else who isn’t in the know. Which is a common trait of database centered people who speak in acronyms, and schema that they assume other people know, and do not spend much time thinking outside of that bubble.</p>

<p>I could make a career out of deploying APIs on top of other data marketplace APIs. Autogenerating a more accessible, indexable, intuitive layer on top of what they’ve already deployed. I regularly find a wealth of data that is accessible through an API interface, but will most likely never be found by anyone. Before most developers will ever make the investment to onboard with an API, they need to understand what valuable resources are available. I can imagine many developers stumble across these data marketplaces, spend about 15 minutes looking around, maybe sign up for a key, but then give up because of the overhead involved with actually understanding what data is actually available.</p>

<p>I’m deploying three new APIs right now, using a new experimental serverless approach I’m evolving. One is a location API, another providing API access to companies, and the third involves working with patents. I will be evolving these three simple web APIs to meet the specific needs of some applications I’m building, but then I will also be selling retail and wholesale access to each API once they’ve matured enough. With all three APIs of these APIs, I began with a simple JSON schema from the data source, which I used to generate three rough OpenAPI definitions that will acts the contract seed for my three services.</p>

<p>Once I had three separate OpenAPI contracts for the services I was delivering, I wanted to spend some time hand designing each of the APIs before I imported into AWS API Gateway, generating Lambda functions, loading in Postman, and used to support other stops along the API lifecycle. I still use <a href="https://editor.swagger.io/">a localized version of Swagger Editor for my OpenAPI design space</a>, but I’m working to migrate to <a href="https://mermade.github.io/openapi-gui/">OpenAPI-GUI</a> as soon as I can. I still very much enjoy the side by side design experience in Swagger Editor, but I want to push forward the GUI side of the conversation, while still retaining quick access to the RAW OpenAPI for editing.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why I still use Swagger Editor is because of the schema validation it does behind the scenes. Which is one of the reasons I need to learn more about <a href="http://speccy.io/">Speccy</a>, as it is going to help me decouple validation from my editor, and all me to use it as part of my wider governance strategy, not just at design time. However, for now I am highly dependent on my OpenAPI editor helping me standardize and stabilize my OpenAPI definitions, before I use them along other stops along the API lifecycle. These three APIs I’m developing are going straight to deployment, because they are simple datasets, where I’m the only consumer (for now), but I still need to make sure my API contract is solid before I move to other stops along the API lifecycle.</p>

<p>Right now, loading up an OpenAPI in Swagger Editor is the best sanity check I have. Not just making sure everything validates, but also making sure it is all coherent, and renders into something that will make sense to anyone reviewing the contract. Once I’ve spend some time polishing the rough corners of an OpenAPI, adding summary, descriptions, tags, and other detail, I feel like I can begin using to generate mocks, deploy in a gateway, and begin managing the access to each API, as well as the documentation, testing, monitoring, and other stops using the OpenAPI contract. Making this manual stop in the evolution of my APIs a pretty critical one for helping me stabilize each API’s definition before I move on. Eventually, I’d like to automate the validation and governance of my APIs at scale, but for now I’m happy just getting a handle on it as part of this API design stop along my life cycle.</p>

From now until the event at the end of September you are going to hear me talk about all the amazing speakers we have, the companies they work for, and the interesting things they are all doing with APIs. One of the perks of being a speaker or a sponsor at APIStrat–you get coverage on API Evangelist, a become part of the buzz around <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/schedule/">the 9th edition of the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference (APIStrat)</a>, now operated by the <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI Initiative (OAI)</a> and <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">the Linux Foundation</a>.</p>

With APIStrat coming to their backyard, and their ability to capture the attention of the APIStrat program committee, Vanick Digital has two separate talks this year:</p>

    <p><strong>Securing the Full API Stack by Patrick Chipman</strong> - APIs open up new channels for sharing and consuming data, but whenever you open a new channel, new security risks emerge. Additionally, APIs often involve a variety of new components, such as API gateways, in-memory databases, edge caches, facade layers, and microservice-aligned data stores that can complicate the security landscape. How and where do you apply the right controls to ensure your API and your data are secure? In this session, we’ll answer that question by identifying the different components commonly used in the delivery of API products. For each layer, we’ll discuss the security risks that can and should be mitigated there, along with best practice approaches (including ABAC, OAuth2, and more) to implement those mitigations.</p>

    <p><strong>What Do You Mean By “API as a Product”? by Lou Powell</strong> - You may have heard the term “API Product.” But what does it mean? In this talk I will introduce the concept and explain the benefits and challenges of transforming your organization to view your APIs as measurable products that expose your companies capabilities, creating agility, autonomy, and acceleration. Traditional product manufacturers create new product and launch them into the marketplace and then measure value; we will teach you to view your APIs in the same way. Concepts covered in this presentation will be designing APIs with Design Thinking, funding your product, building teams, marketing your API, managing your marketplace, and measuring success.</p>

<p>Showcasing their skills as an API focused agency, by bringing it to the stage at APIStrat–smart! I am currently working with their team to understand how API Evangelist and Vanick Digital can work more closely together on projects. Helping me support the customers I’m reaching with my storytelling and workshops, delivering, scaling, and managing the day to day details I don’t have the time to provide for my customers. So it makes me happy to see them at APIStrat, sharing their wisdom, and demonstrating what they are capable of. If you are under resourced like many API providers are, I recommend coming to APIStrat and meeting with the team, or if it can’t wait until September, <a href="https://www.vanick.com/">feel free to reach out directly</a>–just let them know where you found them.</p>

<p>APIStrat is seven weeks away, <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/attend/register-2/">so make sure you get registered</a>. The workshop, session, and keynote lineup is locked up, but we still have a handful of sponsorship opportunities available. <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/sponsor/">You can find the sponsorship prospectus on the web site</a>, or feel free to contact me directly and I’ll get you plugged in with the events team. Make sure you don’t miss out on an opportunity to be part of this ongoing API conversation that we’ve kept going since 2013–where API developers, architects, designers, and API business leaders, evangelists, advocates, and the API curious gather to discuss where the API space is headed. Now that APIStrat is operated by <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">the OpenAPI Initiative</a> it makes it the place to be if you want to contribute to the road map for the OpenAPI specification, and influence the direction of the API specification. No matter how you choose to get involved, we look forward to seeing you all in Nashville next month!</p>

<p><a href="https://bluebutton.cms.gov/bb2dc18/">I’m heading to Washington D.C. this Monday to speak on the API life cycle as part of the Blue Button 2.0 Developer Conference</a>. We’ll be coming together in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, within the west wing complex of the White House, to better understand how we can, “bring together developers to learn and share insights on how we can leverage claims data to serve the Medicare population.”</p>

<p>The gathering will hear from CMS Administrator Seema Verma and other Administrator Leadership about Blue Button 2.0 and the MyHealthEData initiative, while also hosting a series of break sessions, which I’m part of:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blue Button 2.0 and FHIR</strong> (where it’s all heading) with Mark Scrimshire and Cat Greim</li>
  <li><strong>MyHealthEData and Interoperability</strong> with Alex Mugge and Joy Day</li>
  <li><strong>Overview of Medicare Claims Data</strong> with Karl Davis</li>
  <li><strong>Medicare Beneficiary User Research</strong> with Allyssa Allen</li>
  <li><strong>Sync for Science</strong> with Josh Mandel and Andrew Bjonnes</li>
  <li><strong>API Design</strong> with Kin Lane</li>
</ul>

<p>Registration for the gathering is now closed, but if you are a federal govy, I’m sure you can find someone to get you in. I’m looking forward to seeing the CMS, HHS, and USDS folks again, as they are doing some amazing stuff with the Blue Button API, as well as hang out with some of the VA people I know will be there. The Blue Button API is one of the more important API blueprints we have out there in the healthcare space, as well as the federal government. I’ve been a champion on Blue Button since I contributed to the project back when I worked in DC back in 2013, and will continue to invest in its success in coming years.</p>

<p>In my session I will be covering my API lifecycle and governance research as the API Evangelist, but I’m eager to talk with more folks involved with the Blue Button API about what is next, and better understand where <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/">HL7 FHIR</a> is headed, while also developing my awareness of who is actively participating in the Blue Button API community. I’ll be in DC late Sunday night, through Monday, and I’m back to west coast on Tuesday AM. If you are around I’d love to connect, and if you want to tune in, <a href="https://bluebutton.cms.gov/bb2dc18/">I believe there will be a live stream of the event on the Blue Button API portal</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Aug 2018</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope/builder/filtered/23_19_800_500_0_max_0_-5_-1.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p><a href="http://locations.apievangelist.com/#Updates">I am publishing a new API for locations</a>. I am tired of needing some of the same location based resources across projects, and not having a simple, standardized API I can depend on. So I got to work finding the most accurate and complete data set I could find of cities, regions, and countries. I settled on using the complete, and easy to use <a href="https://github.com/prograhammer/countries-regions-cities">countries-regions-cities</a> project by <a href="https://github.com/prograhammer">David Graham</a>–providing a straightforward SQL script I can use as the seed for my locations API database.</p>

<p>After crafting an API for this database using AWS API Gateway and Lambda, and working my way down <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/07/12/my-api-lifecycle-checklist-and-scorecard/">my API checklist</a>, it occurred to me that I wanted to include David Graham’s work as one of the project dependencies. Giving him attribution, while honestly acknowledging my project’s dependency on the data he provided. I’m working hard to include all dependencies within each of the microservices that I’m publishing, being mindful of every data, code, and human dependency that exists behind each service I deliver. Even if I don’t rely on regular updates from them, I still want to acknowledge their contribution, and consider attribution as one layer of my API dependency discussion.</p>

<p>Having a dependency section of my API checklist has helped me evolve how I think about defining the dependencies my services have. I initially began tracking all other services that my microservices were dependent on, but then I quickly began adding details about the other software, data, and people the service depends on as well. I’m also pulling together a machine readable definition for tracking on my microservice dependencies. It will be something I include in the API discovery (APIs.json) document for each service, alongside the OpenAPI, and other specifications. Allowing me to track on the dependencies (and attribution) for all of my APIs, and API related artifacts that I am producing on a regular basis. Providing data provenance for each of my services, documenting the origins of all the data I’m using across my services, and making accessible via an API.</p>

<p>For me, having the data provenance behind each service provides me with a nice clean inventory of all my suppliers. Understanding the data, services, open source code, and people I depend on to deliver a service is important to helping me make sense of my operations. For the people behind the data, services, and open source code I depend on it helps provide attribution, and showcase their valuable contribution to the services I offer. For partner and 3rd party consumers of my services, being observable about the dependencies that exist behind a service they are depending on, helps them make much more educated decisions around which services they put to work, and bake into their applications and systems. In the end, everyone is better off if I invest in data provenance as part of my wider API dependency efforts.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Aug 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/SAP/P5160110.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’ve been having regular meetings with the SAPI API team lately, talking through their presence in the API space, and throwing out ideas for what the future might hold. This isn’t a paid engagement, it is just something I’m interested in investing in on my own, but like many other API service providers in the space, we are exploring what partnership opportunities might there might be. Last week, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/07/26/kicking-the-tires-on-the-sap-api-business-hub/">I wrote about their API Business Hub</a>, which I’ll keep exploring, but first I wanted to address perceptions in the industry that SAP is a little late to the game, when it comes to going all in on APIs.</p>

<p>For me, the SAP API journey begins in 2010, when I left my role as VP of Technology at WebEvents Global, who runs all of SAP Events. By 2010, I had found success in my role by scaling up infrastructure using the AWS cloud, which was orchestrated using APIs, and I was beginning to get a taste of where things were going when it came to delivering digital resources to mobile applications using APIs. I helped lead the technology around SAPPHIRE, SAP’s flagship conference, as well as many other lesser events, and meetings. I had also gotten in trouble by SAP IT leadership for using the cloud, which they labeled a “hobby toy”, and told me I shouldn’t be using. However, I was delivering applications more quickly and cost effectively, so my leadership really couldn’t dismiss my usage of the cloud, and more specifically web APIs. Convincing me that web APIs were going to be more successful than the current web services strategy I was working under.</p>

<p>After seeing the success I was having using APIs to deliver SAP events, and better understanding the potential for delivering global infrastructure in the cloud, and via the increasingly ubiquitous mobile devices we had in our pockets, I left my position and started API Evangelist–eight years later, I’m still doing it. The biggest difference between now and then, is back in 2010 I had to spend a lot of time explaining what is an API, and why someone should be doing it. In 2018, I don’t have to do that, people get it, and most conversations center around how to do APIs right. Everything was a lot more work earlier on, and while there is still so much work to be done, at least now I can get down to business, focusing on the challenges that large enterprise organizations face when doing APIs successfully at scale, and less about having to convince that APIs are a thing in the first place.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/SAP/P5160117.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>When you talk to some people in the API space, they consider SAP a little late to the game as one of the leaders in the software industry. SalesForce, Amazon, Google, Microsoft all saw the signs early on, and IBM, Oracle, CA, HP, and others jumped on the bandwagon along the way, with SAP only joining the conversation in the last couple of years. There are plenty of SAP APIs, and a growing number of API focused services, but SAP just isn’t a player you hear about on a regular basis across the API sector. IBM, CA, and even Oracle have invested significant amounts into their presence in the API space, acquisitions of API talent and solutions, and overall mindshare when you think about APIs. While SAP has a significant amount of work ahead of them to turn up the volume on what they are doing with APIs, they couldn’t have picked a better time to step it up–with so many enterprise organizations finally realizing they need to go API first, SAP will see more return on every dollar they invest into their API operations.</p>

<p>Now is the perfect time to be entering the API game if you are enterprise API service provider. The last decade of growth in the API sector has been established on the backs of many failed and successful API startups, and things are finally beginning to mature, with so many other enterprise organizations looking for direction when it comes to their API strategy. Financial, healthcare, government, and other mainstream sectors are trying to make sense of their digital assets, and APIs are key to this evolution. We are all trying to figure this out, at an individual, professional, and business entity level. In my opinion, any company looking to do APIs, or also sell services to the API sector, should be open and transparent about where they are in their API journey. Do not be embarrassed about being late to the party, not having everything figured out and in place, because this is the exact same position everyone else is at. Sure, there are some organizations that are further along in this journey, but 95% of the mainstream business world is just getting started in this is area.</p>

<p>I’ve been doing API Evangelist for 8 years straight, and I’m still figuring things out. APIs are not a destination, they are a journey. Do not sweat being late for anything, just get to work investing in your journey. Get to work designing, developing, and operating the best in class APIs as possible, putting them to work internally, across your partner landscape, and make them publicly available when it makes sense. If you are selling your services to other API providers, get to work showing why your solutions matter, and are something they should be adopting. In both scenarios, get to work telling the story of your journey in real time. Be honest about how you got here, and where you are going. Tell your story regularly on and offline, and help provide a platform for your API consumers to tell their story. Do this for many year, and eventually, your brand, products, services, and personality will become more common in the ever expanding and evolving world of APIs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/08/06/automating-inequality-and-apis/">Automating Inequality (and APIs)</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">06 Aug 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/apistrat-2018/apistrat-virginia.png" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p><em>As we prepare for <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/">APIStrat in Nashville, TN this September 24th through 26th</a>, I asked my partner in crime Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) to write a post on the significance of Virginia Eubanks, the author of Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor keynoting the conference–she shared this story, of why her work is so significant, and why it is important for the API community to tune in.</em></p>

<p>Repeatable tasks can and should be automated – that’s an assertion that you’ll hear all the time in computing.</p>

<p>Sometimes the rationale is efficiency – it’s cheaper, faster, “labor-saving.” Automation will free up time; it will make our lives easier. Or so we’re told.</p>

<p>Sometimes automation is encouraged in order to eliminate human error or bias.</p>

<p>Increasingly, automation is eliminating human decision-making altogether. And in doing so, let’s be clear, neither bias nor error are removed; rather they are often re-inscribed.  Automation – <em>algorithmic</em> decision-making – can obscure error; it can obscure bias.</p>

<p>This push for more automated decision-making works hand-in-hand with the push for more data collection, itself a process that is already shaped by precedent and by politics. And all this, of course, is facilitated by APIs.</p>

<p>APIs are commonly referred to as a “glue” of sorts – the implication, more often than not, is that APIs are simply a neutral technology holding larger technical systems together. But none of this is neutral – not the APIs and not the algorithms and not the databases.</p>

<p>These technologies are never neutral in their design, development, or implementation. The systems that technologies exist in – organizationally, economically, politically, culturally – are never neutral either.</p>

<p>It seems imperative that those building digital technologies begin to think much more critically about the implications of their work, recognizing that the existing inequalities in the analog systems are readily being ported to the digital sphere.</p>

<p>This makes the work of one of the keynote speakers at this fall’s API Strategy and Practice conference so particularly timely: Virginia Eubanks is a political science professor at the University of Albany, SUNY and the author of Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor. The book is a powerful work of ethnography, chronicling the ways in which data mining, predictive modeling, and algorithmic decision-making reproduce and even exacerbate inequalities in housing, health care, and social welfare services. “The digital poorhouse” Eubanks calls it.</p>

<p>“When we talk about the technologies that mediate our interactions with public agencies today,” she writes, “we tend to focus on their innovative qualities, the ways they break with convention. Their biggest fans call them ‘disruptors,’ arguing that they shake up old relations of power, producing government that is more transparent, responsive, efficient, even inherently more democratic.” This argument overlooks the ways in which new technologies are necessarily entangled in old systems of power. Moreover, those building these technologies benefit from a privilege that both shields them from and blinds them to the ramifications of their work on those most marginalized politically and economically.</p>

<p>Without a purposeful effort to address systemic inequalities, technologies will only make things worse. APIs will only make things worse. Instead, we must be part of the work of rethinking these old systems, listening to those on the margins, and reorienting our technological practices towards equity and justice.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Jul 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/asyncapi/asyncapi-define-your-message-driven-apis.png" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>We need your help moving <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/">the AsyncAPI specification</a> forward. Ok, first, <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi">what is the AsyncAPI specification</a>? “The AsyncAPI Specification is a project used to describe and document Asynchronous APIs. The AsyncAPI Specification defines a set of files required to describe such an API. These files can then be used to create utilities, such as documentation, integration and/or testing tools.” AsyncAPI is a sister specification <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">to OpenAPI</a>, but instead of describing the request and response HTTP API landscape, AsyncAPI is describing the message, topic, event, and streaming API landscape across the HTTP and TCP landscape. It is how we are going to continue to ensure there is machine readable descriptions of this portion of the API landscape, for use in tooling and services.</p>

<p>My friend Fran Mendez (@fmvilas) is the creator and maintainer of the specification, and he is doing way too much of the work on this important specification and he needs our help. Here is Fran’s request for our help to contribute:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>AsyncAPI is an open source project that’s currently maintained by me, with no company or funds behind. More and more companies are using AsyncAPI and the work needed is becoming too much work for a single person working in his spare time. E.g., for each release of the specification, tooling and documentation should be updated. One could argue that I should be dedicating full time to the project, but it’s in this point where it’s too much for spare time and very little to get enough money to live. I want to keep everything for free, because I firmly believe that engineering must be democratized. Also, don’t get me wrong, this is not a complaint. I’m going to continue running the project either with or without contributors, because I love it. This is just a call-out to you, the AsyncAPI lover. I’d be very grateful if you could lend a hand, or even raise your hand and become a co-maintainer. Up to you 😊</em>
<em>On the other hand, I only have good words for all of you who use and/or contribute to the project. Without you, it would be just another crazy idea from another crazy developer 😄</em>
<em>Thank you very much! 🙌</em>
<em>– Fran Mendez</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When it comes to contributing to the AsyncAPI, <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/contribute/blob/master/README.md">Fran has laid out some pretty clear ways in which he needs our help</a>, providing a range of options for you to pitch in and help, depending on what your skills are, and the bandwidth you have in your day.</p>

<p><strong>1. The specification</strong>
There is always work to do in the spec. It goes from fixing typos to writing and reviewing new proposals. I try to keep releases small, to give time to tooling authors to update their software. If you want to start contributing, take a look at https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/issues, pick one, and start working on it. It’s always a good idea to leave a comment in the issue saying that you’re going to work on it, just so other people know about it.</p>

<p><strong>2. Tooling</strong>
As developers, this is sometimes the most straightforward way to contribute. Adding features to the existing tools or creating new ones if needed. Examples of tools are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code generators (multiple languages):
    <ul>
      <li>https://github.com/asyncapi/generator</li>
      <li>https://github.com/asyncapi/node-codegen (going to be deprecated soon in favor of https://github.com/asyncapi/generator)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Documentation generators (multiple formats):
    <ul>
      <li>https://github.com/asyncapi/generator</li>
      <li>https://github.com/asyncapi/docgen (going to be deprecated soon in favor of https://github.com/asyncapi/generator)</li>
      <li>https://github.com/Mermade/widdershins</li>
      <li>https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi-node</li>
      <li>https://github.com/asyncapi/editor</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Validation CLI tool (nobody implemented it yet)</li>
  <li>API mocking (nobody implemented it yet)</li>
  <li>API gateways (nobody implemented it yet)</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, usually the best way to contribute is to pick an issue and chat about it before you create a pull request.</p>

<p><strong>3. Evangelizing</strong>
Sometimes the best way to help a project like AsyncAPI is to simply talk about it. It can be inside your company, in a technology meetup or speaking at a conference. I’ll be happy to help with whatever material you need to create or with arguments to convince your colleagues that using AsyncAPI is a good idea 😊</p>

<p><strong>4. Documentation</strong>
Oh! documentation! We’re trying to convince people that documenting your message-driven APIs is a good idea, but we lack documentation, especially in tooling. This is often a task nobody wants to do, but the best way to get great knowledge about a technology is to write documentation about it. It doesn’t need to be rewriting the whole documentation from scratch, but just identifying the questions you had when started using it and document them.</p>

<p><strong>5. Tutorials</strong>
We learn by examples. It’s a fact. Write tutorials on how to use AsyncAPI in your blog, Medium, etc. As always, count on me if you need ideas or help while writing or reviewing.</p>

<p><strong>6. Stories</strong>
You have a blog and write about the technology you use? Writing about success stories, how-to’s, etc., really helps people to find the project and decide whether they should bet on AsyncAPI or not.</p>

<p><strong>7. Podcasts/Videos</strong>
You have a Youtube channel or your own podcast? Talk about AsyncAPI. Tutorials, interviews, informal chats, discussions, panels, etc. I’ll be happy to help with any material you need or finding the right person for your interview.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/asyncapi/asyncapi-example-streetlight.png" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’m going to take the liberty and add an 8th option, because I’m so straightforward when it comes to this game, and I know where Fran needs help.</p>

<p><strong>8. Money <script type="math/tex"></script></strong>
AsyncAPI needs investment to help push forward, allowing Fran to carve out time, work on tooling, and pay for travel expenses when it comes to attending events and getting the word out about what it does. There is no legal entity setup for AsyncAPI, but I’m sure with the right partner(s) behind it, we can make something happen. Step up.</p>

<p>AsyncAPI is important. We all need to jump in and help. I’ve been investing as many cycles as I can in helping learn about the specification, and tell stories about why it is important. I’ve been working hard to learn more about it so I can contribute to the roadmap. I’m using it as one of the key definition formats driving <a href="http://api.gallery.streamdata.io/">my Streamdata.io API Gallery work</a>, which is all driven using APIs.json, OpenAPI, and provides Postman Collections as well as AsyncAPI definitions when a message, topic, event, or streaming API is present. AsyncAPI is where OpenAPI (Swagger) was in 2011/2012, and with more investment, and a couple more years of adoption and maturing, it will be just as important for working with the evolving API landscape as OpenAPI and Postman Collections are.</p>

<p>If you want to get involved with AsyncAPI, feel free to reach out to me. I’m happy to help you get up to speed on why it is so important. I’m happy to help you understand how it can be applied, and where it fits in with your API infrastructure. You are also welcome to just dive in, as <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/">Fran has done an amazing job of making sure everything is available in the Github organization for the project</a>, where you can submit pull requests, and issues regarding whatever you are working on and contributing. Thanks for your help in making AsyncAPI evolve, and something that will continue to help us understand, quantify, and communicate about the diverse API landscape.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/42crunch/42-crunch-the-api-security-platform-for-the-enterprise.png" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>We are gearing up for <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/">the next edition of APIStrat in Nashville, TN this September 24th through 26th</a>. With the conference less than two months away, and <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/schedule/">the schedule up</a>, I’m building momentum with my usual drumbeat about the speakers, and companies involved. So you’ll be reading a lot of stories related to APIStrat in coming weeks, where I’m looking to build awareness and attendance of the conference, but more importantly showcasing the individuals and companies who are supporting it and helping making the 9th edition of APIStrat amazing.</p>

<p>One of innovative startups I’m partnering with right now, and who you will find speaking and sponsoring APIStrat is <a href="https://www.42crunch.com/">42Crunch</a>. Full disclosure, I’m regularly talking with 42Crunch regarding their road map, and I consider them an API Evangelist partner, however, this is because I find them to be one of the more progressive, and important API startups out there right now. 42Crunch is important in my opinion, because they are focusing on API security, a critical stop along the API lifecycle, and also because of the OpenAPI-driven, awareness building approach to delivering API security. 42Crunch isn’t just bringing API security solutions to the table for you to purchase as a service, they bring API security solutions to the table that help you invest in your internal API security practices–which is the most critical aspect of what they do in my opinion.</p>

<p>42Crunch is focused on API security, but they are what I consider to be a full API lifecycle solution. Meaning they play nicely as one of the tools in your API lifecycle toolbox. Which begins with being OpenAPI-driven, and treating your API’s definition as a contract, but with 42Crunch it is about using this contract to empower your API team to make API security a first-class citizen across all stops along the API lifecycle. Not just at the API management layer, or as an after thought later on when you scan your infrastructure–42Crunch is baking security into your OpenAPI contract, proxying your APIs, and ensuring the right security policies are being applied consistently across the API lifecycle. Helping you think of API security all along the way from design to deployment, to management, testing, monitoring, and deprecation.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about what 42Crunch offers you should be registered for APIStrat, and joining us in Nashville, TN. My friend Isabelle Mauny will be giving her talk on <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/schedule/">Practical SecDevOps for APIs</a>–here is the abstract for her talk: <em>In an ever agile world, API security must become a commodity. By working with security “ON” as early as possible, API developers can detect vulnerabilities when they are easy to fix. By continuously testing APIs for issues, they can ensure vulnerabilities do not sneak in later in the lifecycle. In this session, Isabelle presents a SecDevOps methodology and shares practical solutions for API security assessment, API protection and security monitoring.</em> You should be taking advantage of this opportunity to learn more about what 42Crunch has to offer, and speaking with Isabelle in person about where API security is going in 2018, because they are the people pushing forward the conversation as part of <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">the OpenAPI Initiative,</a> and with their API security services.</p>

<p>Make sure you don’t miss out on the API conversation in Nashville this fall. <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/attend/register-2/">Get registered for APIStrat</a>, and make sure you are participating in the ongoing API discussion that is APIStrat. While the conference will continue to be an environment where developers and business folk to gather and discuss the technology, business, and politics of APIs, this year will also have a music focus because of the venue. Making it something you will not want to miss out, with all the keynotes, sessions, workshops, and hallway and late night conversations with all API leaders from across the sector.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/07/27/a-service-level-agreement-sla-definition-for-the-openapi-specification/">The Service Level Agreement (SLA) Definition For The OpenAPI Specification</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 Jul 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/legalstatue_light_dali.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/isa-group/SLA4OAI-Specification">I’m currently learning more about SLA4OAI, an open source standard for describing SLA in APIs</a>, which is based on the standards proposed by the OAI, adding an optional profile for defining SLA (Service Level Agreements) for APIs. “This SLA definition in a neutral vendor flavor will allow to foster innovation in the area where APIs expose and documents its SLA, API Management tools can import and measure such key metrics and composed SLAs for composed services aggregated way in a standard way.” Providing not just a needed standard for the API sector, but more importantly one that is built on top of an existing standard.</p>

<p>SLA4OAI, provides an interesting way to define the SLA for any API, providing a set of objects that augment and can be paired with an OpenAPI definition using an x-sla vendor extension:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/isa-group/SLA4OAI-Specification/blob/master/Specification.md#522-contextobject">Context</a></strong> - Holds the main information of the SLA context.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/isa-group/SLA4OAI-Specification/blob/master/Specification.md#524-infrastructureobject">Infrastructure</a></strong> - Required Provides information about tooling used for SLA storage, calculation, governance, etc.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/isa-group/SLA4OAI-Specification/blob/master/Specification.md#525-pricingobject">Pricing</a></strong> - Global pricing data.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/isa-group/SLA4OAI-Specification/blob/master/Specification.md#526-metricsobject">Metrics</a></strong> - A list of metrics to use in the context of the SLA.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/isa-group/SLA4OAI-Specification/blob/master/Specification.md#528-plansobject">Plans</a></strong> - A set of plans to define different service levels per plan.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/isa-group/SLA4OAI-Specification/blob/master/Specification.md#5210-quotasobject">Quotas</a></strong> - Global quotas, these are the default quotas, but they could be overridden by each plan later.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/isa-group/SLA4OAI-Specification/blob/master/Specification.md#5211-ratesobject">Rates</a></strong> - Global rates, these are the default rates, but they could be overridden by each plan later.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/isa-group/SLA4OAI-Specification/blob/master/Specification.md#5212-guaranteesobject">Guarantees</a></strong> - Global guarantees, these are the default guarantees, but they could be overridden by each plan later.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/isa-group/SLA4OAI-Specification/blob/master/Specification.md#5218-configurationsobject">Configuration</a></strong> - Define the default configurations, later each plan can be override it.</li>
</ul>

<p>These objects provide all the details you will need to quantify the SLA for any OpenAPI defined API. In order to validate each of the SLAs, a separate Basic SLA Management Services is provided to implement the services that control, manage, report and track SLAs. Providing the reporting output you will need to understand whether or not each individual API is meeting its SLA. Providing a universal SLA format that can be used to create SLA templates, applied as individual API SLAs, and then leveraging a common schema for reporting on SLA monitoring, which can actually be used in conjunction with the API management layer of your API operations.</p>

<p>I’m still getting familiar with the specification, but I’m impressed with what I’ve seen so far. There is a lot of detail available in there, and it provides all the context that will be needed to quantify, measure, and report upon API SLAs. My only critique at this point is that I feel the pricing, metrics, plans, and quotas elements should be broken out into a separate specification so that they can be used out of the context of just SLA management, and as part of the wider API management strategy. There are plenty of scenarios where you will want to be using these elements, but not in the context of SLA enforcement (ie. driving pricing and plan pages, billing and invoicing, and API discovery). Other than than, I’m pretty impressed with the work present in the specification.</p>

<p>It makes me happy to see sister specifications emerge like this, rather than also baked directly into the OpenAPI. The way they’ve referenced the SLA from the OpenAPI definition, and the OpenAPI from the SLA definition is how these things should occur, in my opinion. It has been something I’ve done for years with <a href="http://apisjson.org/">the APIs.json format</a>, having seen a future where there are many sister or even competing specifications all working in unison. Which is why I feel the pricing and plan elements should be decoupled from the SLA object here. However, I think this is a great start to something that we are going to need if we expect this whole API thing to actually work at scale, and make sure the technology of APIs is in sync with the business of APIs. Without it, there will always been a gulf between the technology and business units, much like we’ve seen historically between IT and business groups across enterprise organizations today.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Jul 2018</span>
        <p>I am deploying a patent review API for a client, using data from <a href="https://ped.uspto.gov/peds/">the Patent Examination Data System (PEDS)</a>. You can download complete JSON or XML data from the United States Patent Office (USPTO), and they even have an API. So, why would I be launching yet another API? Well, because what they have is so cryptic, complex, and lacking in any schema or API design, there is value in me pushing the API conversation forward a bit by thinking deeply about how other people will potentially be using these resources–something the USPTO clearly hasn’t done.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://ped.uspto.gov/api/swagger-ui.html">USPTO PEDS API</a> (that is more acronyms than you can shake a stick at) is a great example of how much database people, and developers take for granted as they operate within their little bubbles, without much concern for how the rest of the world views their work–take a look at the screenshot of thee USPTO PEDS API.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/uspto/uspto-peds-api.png" align="center" width="90%" /></p>

<p>There is only one telling sign on this page regarding what this API does–the email address for the contact, which has a uspto.gov address. Beyond that there is not a single sign of the resources available within this API, or the value they bring to the table. Even if you can extrapolate that this is a patent API, there is nothing to tell you that you can’t actually get patent data from this, you can only get meta data about the patents, reviewers, inventors, and the activity around the patent. For me, the API reflects many of the challenges developers and database people face when it comes to thinking out of their box, and effectively communicating with external consumers–which is the whole reason we do web APIs.</p>

<p>I’m pretty well versed consuming patent data, and it took me several hours to get up to speed with this set of resources. I opted to not deal with the API, which is just an ElasticSearch index on top of a patent file store, and went directly to the full-size zipped up download. Something the average user will not have the knowledge, skills, and resources to always do. Which is why I feel there is value in me investing some schema and API design cycles into making the USPTO PEDS API a little more coherent, accessible, and usable by a wider audience using a simple web API. Moving it beyond the realm of wizards (database and developers), and making it something normal people, say patent attorneys, and other business folk can put to use in their work.</p>

<p>The USTPO PEDS API reflects the divide between tech and business people. Some database people and developers will think the implementation is a good one, because it gives them the full download, as well as a customizable, ElasticSearch interface for querying what you want. Many though, will walk away, because they aren’t willing to make the several hour investment getting up to speed on the schema, so they can make their first API query, or load the full download into the database backend of their choosing. This is where an investment on API design begins to pay dividends, is reaching this wider audience of potential consumers who are unwilling to make the investment getting up to speed, or do not have the resources or knowledge to work with the full download or an ElasticSearch interface. Unless of course, your in the business of keeping data out of the hands of these people, which many folks are.</p>

<p>I am a 30 year database professional. I get databases and querying solutions. What many GraphQL and ElasticSearch believers get wrong when they rely on these solutions for delivering publicly available APIs, is that they are unwilling to come to terms with the fact they can’t see their resources through the eyes of the public. They think everyone is like them, and thus want a full blown query interface to get at a known schema. They see API design as unnecessary work, when in reality, they are just unwilling to do the heavy lifting, and they are either consciously, or unconsciously passing that work off to each individual consumer. If you are keeping your APIs available for internal use amongst controlled group of developers this isn’t a problem, but if you are making your APIs available to a wider public audience, it ends up showing that you haven’t taken the time to think deeply about how others will be using your APIs, or that you just doo not care.</p>

<p>While writing about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/07/09/concerns-around-managing-many-microservice-repositories-and-going-with-a-mono-repo/">the discussions I’ve been having with folks around using monorepos to manage microservices</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/statics-and-dynamics/should-i-use-a-single-monolithic-lambda-function-or-multiple-lambda-functions-with-api-gateway-d99b0230f1e7">I came across this post about whether or not people should be using a single monolithic Lambda function or multiple lambda functions with the AWS API Gateway</a>. Again, surprising me about how lazy people are, and how difficult it is for people to think about things in a decoupled way. Which I think is the reason many people will go back to doing monolithic applications, and fail at microservices, not because it technically won’t work, it is just because it will be perceived as more work, and with a lack of imagination around how to work in a distributed way, people will give up.</p>

<p>First, I do not think microservices is a good idea for all applications. Second, I don’t always subscribe to microservices meaning small or micro. I think a service mindset is good, and it is healthy to decouple, and reduce the surface area of your services, minimizing dependencies, but there are many situations where a super small microservice will be a bad idea. However, if you are going to do serverless microservices with Lambda and AWS API Gateway, I do not understand why you’d want a single monolithic function behind many different API paths. I’m guessing that people who think you should do monolithic serverless haven’t thought about sensible organization of their functions, and orchestration of them using the AWS CLI or API. They are managing them through the AWS dashboard and are thinking, <em>“man this is a lot of work, let’s just do a single function, with the routing built in.”</em></p>

<p>Similar to folks thinking a monorepo is a good idea over many different repos, without ever thinking about organizations using Github organizations, and orchestration using Git and the Github API, people aren’t getting creative with their Lamdba functions. People seem to be in love with brainstorming and dreaming about decoupled approaches to doing APIs, but when it comes to the hard work of actually doing it, and having an imagination when it comes to orchestration and reducing friction, people would rather just give up. I’m not 100% sold on serverless being the right use case for driving APIs, but I can tell you one thing, that having many different APIs with a single Lambda function behind it will not give you the granularity you need for understanding the performance, and functionality behind each API and service you are delivering–you are just going to create new problems that you won’t have the visibility into to be able to optimize.</p>

<p>I’m reading a lot about microservices backlash lately. I’m guessing after about 1-2 more years of serverless, we will start seeing serverless backlash. While some of this backlash will be about folks using microservices and serverless for use cases that didn’t make sense, I’m guessing a significant amount will be because people can’t decouple their imagination, and think through the necessary organization and orchestration required to think about doing distributed applications at scale. Without it, they are going to fumble, struggle, and see decoupling as all about making extra work for themselves, and go back to the way they were doing things before. In my experience these folks are always on the hunt for easy solutions to their complex problems, and when you aren’t willing to invest the time into doing it right, and properly understanding all the moving parts, you are going to fail, and revert to what you know. The problem with this, is I’m guessing you are going to also fall prey to the next trend, and not have the capacity to understand what it is all about before going all in, yet again.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/sap/sap-api-business-hub.png" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I told the folks over at SAP that I would take a look at their <a href="https://api.sap.com">API Business Hub</a>. It isn’t paid work, just helping provide feedback on another addition to the <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> front, something I’m pretty committed to helping push forward in any way that I can. They’ve pulled together a pretty clean, OpenAPI driven catalog of useful APIs for the enterprise, so I wanted to make sure I kick the tires and size it up alongside the other API discovery work I am doing.</p>

<p><a href="https://api.sap.com/themes/APICONTEN">The SAP API Business Hub is a pretty simple and clean catalog for searching and browsing applications, integrations, as well as APIs</a>–I am going to focus in on the API section. Which at first glance looks to have about 70 separate APIs, but then you notice each of them are just umbrellas for each API platform, and some of them contain many different API endpoints. Some of the APIs are simple language translation and text extraction resources, while others provide robust access to the SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP Ariba, and other SAP systems. You see a lot of SAP focused solutions, but then <a href="https://api.sap.com/themes/PartnerContent">you also see a handful of partner solutions</a> added via their platform partner program.</p>

<p>I see the beginnings of a useful API catalog getting going on over at the SAP API Business Hub. Each API is well documented, and provides an OpenAPI definition for each API, complete with interactive documentation you can play within a sandbox environment. More than most API catalogs, marketplaces, and directories I profile have available. Allowing you to kick the tires and see what is going on, before working with the production version. They also provide you with a Java SDK to download for each API, something that could easily be expanded to support many different platforms, programming languages, and continuous integration cycles <a href="http://apimatic.io">with solutions like APIMATIC</a>. Making it more of a discovery, as well as integration marketplace.</p>

<p>Like any API marketplace effort, SAP needs to drum up activity within their catalog. They need more partners signing up to add their APIs, as well as consumers being made aware of the resources published there–something that takes a lot of work, evangelism, and storytelling. Next, I’m going to go through their partner signup and see what I can do to add some of my API resources there, and tell some stories about how they might be able to improve upon the partner flow. I like that their marketplace is OpenAPI driven. I’m curious about how much of the API publishing process is machine readable, allowing API providers to easily add their resources, without a lot of manual form work–something most are going to not have the time and resources for. I’ll keep evaluating how the SAP API Business Hub overlaps with my other API discovery work on <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a>, the <a href="http://api.gallery.streamdata.io/">Streamdata.io API Gallery</a>, <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/api-network/">Postman Network</a>, and partnerships with <a href="https://apis.guru/">APIs.guru</a>, <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, and others–continuing to push forward the API discovery conversation after almost 8 years.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Jul 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/captain_small.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I read a lot of API documentation, and help review API portals for clients, and one of the most common rookie mistakes I see made, is people pointing out the obvious, and writing a bunch of fluffy, meaningless content that gets in the way of people actually using an API. When the obvious API industry stuff is combined with the assumed elements of what a company does, you end up with a meaningless set of obstacles that slow API integration down. Here is the most common thing I read when entering an API portal:</p>

<p><em>“This is an API for querying data from the [Company X] platform, to get access to JSON from our system which allows you to get data from our system into yours using the web. You will need to write code to make calls to our APIs documented here on the page below. Our API uses REST to accept request and provide responses in a JSON format.”</em></p>

<p>I’ve read API after API that never tells you what the API does. It just assumes you know what the company does, and then goes into verbose explanations of what API, REST, JSON, and other things that should be intuitive if an API is well designed, and immediately accessible via an API. People tend to make to many assumptions about API consumers already knowing what a company does, while also assuming they known absolutely nothing about APIs, and burying actual API documentation behind a bunch of API blah blah blah, instead of just doing and being the API.</p>

<p>It is another side effect of developers, database, and IT folk not being very good at thinking outside of their bubble. It goes beyond techies not having social skills, and is more about them not having to think about other people at all. They just don’t have the ability to put themselves in the shoes of someone landing on the home page of their developer portal, and not knowing anything about the company or the API, and asking themselves, “what does this person need?”. Which I get being something developers don’t think about with internal APIs, but publishing an API publicly, and not stepping back to think about what someone is going to need isn’t acceptable.</p>

<p>Even with my experience, I still struggle to say exactly what needs to be said. There is no perfect introduction to a complex, often abstract set of APIs. However, you can invest a little more time thinking about what others will be needing, maybe run your portal by some external people for a little coherence testing. Most of all, just try to avoid being captain obvious, or captain assumption, and writing content that states the obvious while leaving out most of the critical details you take for granted. It really is the most important lessons we can take away from providing APIs, the ability for them to push us out of our boxes, from behind our firewalls, and have to engage with the real world.</p>

<p>About 60% of my work these days is building upon the last five years of my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack research</a>, with a focus on building out the <a href="http://api.gallery.streamdata.io/">Streamdata.io API Gallery</a>. We are fine tuning our approach for discovering new API-driven resources from across the landscape, while also profiling, quantifying, ranking, and publishing to the Streamdata.io API Gallery, The API Stack, and potentially other locations like the Postman Network, APIs.Guru, and other API discovery destinations I am working with. Helping us make sense of the increasingly noisy API landscape, while identifying the most valuable resources, and then profiling them to help reduce friction when it comes to potentially on-boarding and streaming data from each resource.</p>

<h3 id="discover-new-api-driven-resources">Discover New API-Driven Resources</h3>
<p>Finding new APIs isn’t too difficult, you just have to Google for them. Finding new APIs in an automated way, with minimum human interaction becomes a little more difficult, but there are some proven ways to get the job done. There is no single place to go find new APIs, so I’ve refined a list of common place I use to discover new APIs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Search Engines</strong> - Using search engine APIs to look for APIs based upon the vocabulary we’ve developed.</li>
  <li><strong>Github</strong> - Github provides a wealth of signals when it comes to APIs, and we use the Github API to discover interesting sources using our vocabulary.</li>
  <li><strong>Stack Overflow</strong> - Using the Stack Exchange API, we are able to keep an eye out for developers talking about different types of interesting APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>Twitter</strong> - The social network still provides some interesting signals when it comes to discussions about interesting APis.</li>
  <li><strong>Reddit</strong> - There are many developers who still use Reddit to discuss technical topics, and ask questions about the APIs they are using.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the topic and entity vocabulary we’ve been developing, we can automate the discovery of new APIs across these sources using their APIs. Helping track on signals for the existing APIs we are keeping an eye on, but also quickly identify new APIs that we can add to the queue. Giving us the URL of companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies who are doing interesting things with APIs.</p>

<h3 id="profile-new-domains-that-come-in">Profile New Domains That Come In</h3>
<p>Our API discovery engine produces a wealth of URLs for us to look at to understand the potential for new data, content, and algorithmic API resources. Our profiling process begins with a single URL, which we then use as the seed for a series of automated jobs that help us understand what an entity is all about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Description</strong> - Develop the most informative and concise description of what an entity does, including a set of rich meta tags.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer</strong> - Identify where their developer and API program exists, for quantifying what they do.</li>
  <li><strong>Blog</strong> - Find their blog, and supporting RSS feed so we can tune into what they are saying.</li>
  <li><strong>Press</strong> - Also find their press section, and RSS feed so we can tune into the press about them.</li>
  <li><strong>Twitter</strong> - Find their Twitter account so that we can tune into their social stream.</li>
  <li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> - Find their LinkedIn account so that we can tune into their social stream.</li>
  <li><strong>Github</strong> - Find their Github account so we can find more about what they are building.</li>
  <li><strong>Contact</strong> - Establish a way to contact each entity, in case we have any questions or need support.</li>
  <li><strong>Other</strong> - Identify other common building blocks like support, pricing, and terms of services that helps us understand what is going on.</li>
</ul>

<p>The profiling process provides us with a framework to understand what an entity is all about, and where they fit into the bigger picture of the API landscape. Most of the sources of information we profile have some sort of machine readable component, allowing us to further quantify the entity, and better understand the value they bring to the table.</p>

<h3 id="quantify-each-entity">Quantify Each Entity</h3>
<p>Next up we want to quantify each of the entities we’ve profiled, to give us a better understanding of the scope of their operations, and further define where they fit into the API landscape. We are looking for as much detail about what they are up to so we can know where we should be investing our time and energy reaching out and developing deeper relationships.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>API</strong> - We profile their APIs, generating an OpenAPI definition that describes the entire surface area of their APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>Applications</strong> - Define approximately how many applications are running on an API, and how many developers are actively using.</li>
  <li><strong>Blog</strong> - Pull all their blog posts, including the history, and actively pull on daily basis.</li>
  <li><strong>Press</strong> - Pull all their press releases, including the history, and actively pull on daily basis.</li>
  <li><strong>Twitter</strong> - Pull all their Tweets and mentions, including the history, and actively pull on daily basis.</li>
  <li><strong>Github</strong> - Pull all their repos, stars, followers, and commit history, understand more about what they are building.</li>
  <li><strong>Other</strong> - Pull other relevant signals from Reddit, Stack Overflow, AngelList, CrunchBase, SEC, Alexa Rank, ClearBit, and other important platform signals.</li>
</ul>

<p>By pulling all the relevant signals for any entity we’ve profiled, we can better understand the scope of their operations, and assess the reach of their network. Helping us further quantity the value and opportunity that exists with each entity we are profiling, before we spend much more time on integrating.</p>

<h3 id="ranking-each-entity">Ranking Each Entity</h3>
<p>After we’ve profiled and quantify an entity, we like to rank them, and put them into different buckets, so that we can prioritize which ones we reach out to, and which ones we invest more resources in monitoring, tracking, and integrating with. We currently rank them on a handful of criteria, using our own vocabulary and ranking formula.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Provider Signals</strong> - Rank their activity and relevance based upon signals within their control.</li>
  <li><strong>Community Signals</strong> - Rank their activity based upon signals the community generates about them.</li>
  <li><strong>Analyst Signals</strong> - Rank their activity based upon signals from the analyst community.</li>
  <li><strong>StreamRank</strong> - Rank the activity of their data, content, and API-driven resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Topically</strong> - Understand the value of the activity based upon the topics that are available.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our ranking of each entity gives us an overall score derived from several different dimensions.  Helping us understand the scope, as well as the potential value for each set of APIs, allowing us to further prioritize which entities we invest more time and resources into, maximizing our efforts when it comes to deeper, more technical integrations, and streaming of data into any potential data lake.</p>

<h3 id="publishing-apis-to-the-gallery">Publishing APIs To The Gallery</h3>
<p>Once an entity has been profiled, quantified, and ranked, we publish the profile to the gallery for discovery. Some of the more interesting APIs we hold back on a little bit, and share with partners and customers who are looking for interesting data sources via landscape analysis reports, but once we are ready we publish the entity to a handful of potential locations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://api.gallery.streamdata.io/">Streamdata.io API Gallery</a></strong> - The distributed gallery owned and operated by Streamdata.io</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://theapistack.com">The API Stack</a></strong> - My own research area for profiling APIs that I’ve run for five years.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://apis.guru/">APIs.guru</a></strong> - We are working on the best way to submit OpenAPI definitions to our friends here.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/api-network/">Postman Network</a></strong> - For APIs that we validate, and generate working Postman Collections.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a></strong> - Publishing to the machine readable API search engine for indexing.</li>
  <li>Other - We have a network of other aggregation, discovery, and related sites we are working with.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because each entity is published to its own Github repository, with an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a>, and Postman Collection defining its operations, once published, each entity becomes forkable. Making each gallery entry something anyone can fork, download and directly integrate into their existing systems and applications.</p>

<h3 id="keep-discovering-profiling-quantifying-and-publishing">Keep Discovering, Profiling, Quantifying, and Publishing</h3>
<p>This work is never ending. We’ll just keep discovery, profiling, quantifying, and publishing useful APIs to the gallery, and beyond. Since we benchmark APIs, we’ll be monitoring APIs that go away and we’ll archive them in the listings. We’ll also be actively quantifying each entity, by tuning into their blogs, press, Twitter, and Github accounts looking for interesting activity about what they are doing. Keeping our finger on the pulse of what each entity is up to, as well as what the scope and activity within their community is all about.</p>

<p>This project began as an API Evangelist project to understand how to keep up with the changing API space, and then evolved into a landscape analysis and lead generation tool for Streamdata.io, but now has become an engine for identifying valuable data and content resources. Providing a powerful discover engine for finding valuable data sources, but when combined with what Streamdata.io does, it also allows you to tune into the most important signals across all these entities being profiled, and stream the resulting data and signals into data lakes within your own existing cloud infrastructure, for use in training machine learning models, dashboards, and other relevant applications.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Jul 2018</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope/builder/filtered/68_113_800_500_0_max_0_1_-1.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>This is a report for the Department of Veterans Affairs microconsulting project, “<a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA-Micropurchase-Repo/issues/18">Governance Models in Public and Private Sector</a>”. Providing an overview of API governance to help the VA, “understand, with the intention to adopt, best practices from the private and public sector, specifically for prioritizing APIs to build, standards to which to build APIs, and making the APIs usable by external consumers.” Pulling together several years of research conducted by industry analyst API Evangelist, as well as phone interviews with API practitioners from large enterprise organizations who are implementing API governance on the ground across the public and private sector, conducted by Skylight Digital.</p>

<p>We’ve assembled this report to reflect the interview conversations we had with leaders from the space, helping provide a walk through of the types or roles and software architecture being employed to implement governance at large organizations. Then we walk through governance as it pertains to identifying possible APIs, developing standards around the delivery of APIs, how organizations are moving APIs into production, as well as presenting them to their consumers. Wrapping up with an overview of formal API governance details, as well as an acknowledgement that most API governance is rarely ever a fully formed initiative at this point in time. Providing a narrative for API governance, with a wealth of bulleted elements that can be considered, and assembled in the service of helping govern the API efforts across any large enterprise.</p>

<h2 id="roles-within-an-organization">Roles Within An Organization</h2>
<p>There are many roles being used by organizations who are leading the conversation around the delivery of high quality, industry changing APIs. Defining the personalities that are needed to make change across large organizations when it comes to delivering APIs consistently at scale. While there may be many names for the specific roles leading the charge it is clear that these people are bringing a unique blend of skills to an organization, with an emphasis in a couple of key areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Leadership</strong> - Providing leadership for teams when it comes to APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>Innovation</strong> - A focus on innovation using APIs across the organization.</li>
  <li><strong>Communication</strong> - Facilitating communication across all teams, and projects.</li>
  <li><strong>Advisory</strong> - Acting as an advisor to existing leadership and management.</li>
  <li><strong>Strategy</strong> - Helping existing teams develop, evolve, and realize their strategy.</li>
  <li><strong>Success</strong> - Focusing on helping existing teams be successful when it comes to APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>Architect</strong> - Bringing a wide variety of software architectural skills to the table.</li>
  <li><strong>Coaching</strong> - Being a coach to existing teams, and decision makers across the organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bringing together a unique set of skills that range from the technical to deep knowledge of the business domain, into a concentrated, although sometimes distributed effort to bring change across an organization using APIs. Along with these roles, many large organizations are investing in new types of structure to help develop talent, take charge of new ideas, and move forward the enterprise wide API strategy, with a handful of common characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Labs</strong> - Treating API efforts as if it is a laboratory creating new experiments.</li>
  <li><strong>Center</strong> - Making it a center for API thinking, ideation, and for access to information.</li>
  <li><strong>Centralized</strong> - Keeping all efforts in a single group or organization within larger entity.</li>
  <li><strong>Distributed</strong> - Emphasis on keeping API knowledge distributed and not centralized at all.</li>
  <li><strong>Global</strong> - Acknowledging that APIs will need to be a global initiative for larger organizations.</li>
  <li><strong>Excellence</strong> - Focusing on the organization bring excellence to how APIs are delivered.</li>
  <li><strong>Embedded</strong> - Making sure there is API knowledge and expertise embedded in every group.</li>
</ul>

<p>Combing a unique set of skills and personalities, into a focused organization that takes the reins when it comes to leading API change, and digital transformation at an organization. While many of these efforts emphasize a center, or centralized presence, many are also realizing the importance of embedded and distributed approach, ensuring that talent, and ideas grow within existing teams, and are not seen as just some new, external, isolated group or initiative.</p>

<p>There clearly is not a single role or organization structure that brings success to API efforts at scale across the enterprise, however there are clear patterns being applied in the early stages that can be emulated. Helping ensure that API knowledge and expertise is available and accessible by all groups across an organization, and all its geographic regions, ensuring that the entire enterprise is part of the conversation and moving forward in unison.</p>

<h2 id="software-architecture-design">Software Architecture Design</h2>
<p>Governance is all about shaping and crafting the way we design and architect software, leveraging the web, and specifically web APIs to help drive the web, mobile, device, and network applications we depend on. There are a number of healthy, and not so healthy patterns across the landscape for considering as we look to shape and transform our software architecture, begin honest about the forces that influence what software is, does, and what it will ultimately become.</p>

<h3 id="domain-awareness">Domain Awareness</h3>
<p>Software architecture is always a product of its environment, being influenced by a number of factors that already exist within any given domain. We are seeing a number of factors influence how large enterprises are investing and defining their software architecture. Here are a handful of the top areas of consideration when it comes to how the domain an enterprise exists within impact architecture:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Resources</strong> - The types of digital resources an enterprise already possess will drive software architecture, defining how it works, grows, expands, and shifts.</li>
  <li><strong>Schema</strong> - Existing schema define how data is stored, and often gathered and syndicated–even if this is abstracted away through other systems, it is still influencing architectural decisions at all levels.</li>
  <li><strong>Process</strong> - Existing business process are already in motion, driving current architecture, and is something that cannot immediately be changed, without having echoes of impact on future architectural decisions.</li>
  <li><strong>Industry</strong> - External industry factors are always emerging to shift how software architecture is crafted, providing design, development, and operational factors that need to be considered as architecture is refactored.</li>
  <li><strong>Regulatory</strong> - Beyond more organic industry influences, there are regulatory, legal, and other government considerations that will shift how software architecture will ultimately operate.</li>
  <li><strong>Definitions</strong> - The access and availability of machine readable definitions, schema, process, and other guiding structural elements that can help make software architecture operate more efficiently, or less efficiently in the absence of standardization, and portability.</li>
</ul>

<p>Domain expertise, awareness, and structure will always shape software architecture, and the decision making process that surrounds it. Making it an imperative for there to be an investment in internal capacity as well as leveraging external expertise and vendors when it comes to shaping the enterprise architectural landscape. Without the proper internal capacity, domain knowledge can be minimized, weakening the overall architecture of the digital infrastructure nutrients an enterprise will need to move forward.</p>

<h3 id="legacy-considerations">Legacy Considerations</h3>
<p>We can never escape the past when it comes to the software architectural decisions we make, and it is important that we don’t just see legacy as a negative, and also view legacy as a historical artifact that should move forward. Maybe not always the same legacy code should be in forward motion, but the wisdom, knowledge, and lessons learned around the enterprise legacy should be on display. Here are a handful of the legacy considerations we’ve identified through our discussions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Systems</strong> - Existing systems in operation have a significant influence over all current and future architectural decisions, making legacy system consideration a top player when it comes to decision making around software architecture conversations.</li>
  <li><strong>People</strong> - Senior staff who operate and sustain legacy system, or were around when they were developed possess a significant amount of power when it comes to influencing any new system architecture, and what gets invested in or not.</li>
  <li><strong>Partners</strong> - External partners who have significant history with the enterprise possess a great deal of voting power when it comes to what software architecture gets adopted or not.</li>
  <li><strong>Trauma</strong> - Legacy trauma from historical outages, breaches, and bad architectural decisions will continue to influence the future, especially when legacy teams still have influence over future projects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Systems, people, partners, and bad decisions made in the past will continue to drive, and often times haunt each wave of software architectural shifts. This influence cannot be ignored, abandoned, and needs to be transformed into positive effects on next generation investment in software architecture. Change will be inevitable, and legacy technical and cultural debt needs to be addressed, but not at the cost of repeating the mistakes of the past.</p>

<h3 id="contemporary-considerations">Contemporary Considerations</h3>
<p>After legacy concerns, we all live in the reality have been given, and it is something that will continue to shape how we define our architecture. Throughout our discussions with companies, institutions, and government agencies regarding the challenges they face, and the current forces that shape their software architecture decisions, we found several recurring themes regarding contemporary considerations that were making the largest impact:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Talent Available</strong> - The talent available for designing, developing, and deploying of API infrastructure dictates what is possible at all stages.</li>
  <li><strong>Offshore Workers</strong> - The offshoring of work changes the governance dynamics, and requires strong processes, and a different focus when it comes to execution.</li>
  <li><strong>Mainstream Awareness</strong> - Keeping software architectural practices in alignment with mainstream practices helps shape software architecture decisions, allowing them to move forward at a healthier pace.</li>
  <li><strong>Internal Capacity</strong> - It has been stated several times that doing APIs at scale across the enterprise would not be possible without investing in internal capacity over outsourcing, or depending on vendor solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Modern practices continue shaping how we deliver our software architecture, defining how we govern the evolution of our infrastructure, and find the resources and talent to make it happen. Keeping software architecture practices in alignment with contemporary approaches helps streamline the road map, how teams work with partners, and can outsource and work with external entities to help get the job done as efficiently as possible.</p>

<h3 id="technically-defined">Technically Defined</h3>
<p>The technology we adopts helps define and govern how software architecture is delivered, and evolved. There are many evolution trends in software architecture that has moved the conversation forward, allowing teams to be more agile, consistent, and efficient in doing what they do. As we studied the architectural approaches of leading API providers across the landscape, and engaged in conversations with a handful of them, we found several technologically defined views of how software architecture is influencing future generations and iterations.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Vendors</strong> - Specific vendors have their owning guiding principles to how software architecture gets defined, delivered, and governed. Often times given an outsized role in dictating what happens next.</li>
  <li><strong>Frameworks</strong> - Software and programming language frameworks dictate specific patterns, and govern how software is delivered, and lead the conversation on how it evolves. Software frameworks can possess a significant amount of dogma that will have a gravity all its own when it comes to evolving into the future.</li>
  <li><strong>Cloud Platforms</strong> - Amazon, Google, and Microsoft (Azure) have a strong voice in how software architecture is defined in the current climate, providing us with the services and tooling to govern the lifecycle. This control over how we define our infrastructure is only going to increase with their market dominance in the digital realm.</li>
  <li><strong>Continuous Integration / Deployment</strong> - CI/CD services and tooling have established a new way of defining software architecture, and establishing a pipeline approach to moving it forward, building in the hooks needed to govern every step of its evolution. Reducing the cycles from annual down to monthly, weekly, and even daily cycles of change.</li>
  <li><strong>Source Control</strong> - Github, Gitlab, and Bitbucket are defining how software is delivered, providing the vehicle for moving code forward, the hooks for governing each commit, and step forward any infrastructure makes as it is versioned, and evolved.</li>
</ul>

<p>These areas are increasingly governing how we design, develop, deploy, and manage our infrastructure. Providing us with the scaffolding we need to hang our technological infrastructure on, and gives us the knobs and levers we can pull to consistently orchestrate, and move forward increasingly complex and large enterprise software infrastructure, across many teams, and geographic regions. The decisions we make around the technology we use will stick with us for years, and continue to influence decisions even after it is gone.</p>

<h2 id="business-defined">Business Defined</h2>
<p>When it comes to delivering software architecture, not everything is governed by the technical components, and much of what gets delivered and moved forward will defined by the business side of the equation. The amount of investment by a business into its overall IT, as well as more progressive groups, will determine what gets done, and what doesn’t. With the following elements of the business governing software architecture in several cases::</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Budgets</strong> - How much money is allocated for a team to work when it comes to defining, deploying, managing, and iterating upon software architecture.</li>
  <li><strong>Investors</strong> - Many groups are influenced, driven, and even restricted by outside investors, determining what software architecture is prioritized, and even dictating the decisions around what is put to work.</li>
  <li><strong>Partners</strong> - External partners with strong influence over the business discussions that drive software infrastructure decision play a big role in the governance, or lack of governance involved.</li>
  <li><strong>Public Image</strong> - Often times the decisions that go into software architecture, and the governance of how it moves forward will be driven by the public image concerns around company, and its stakeholders.</li>
  <li><strong>Culture</strong> - The culture of a business will drive decisions being made when it comes to developing, managing, and governing software architecture, which can be more challenging to move forward than the technology in many cases.</li>
</ul>

<p>The governance of software architecture has to be in alignment with business objectives of an enterprise. Many groups choose to begin their API journeys based upon trends, or the desire of a small group, and have encountered significant friction when trying to bring in alignment with the wider enterprise business objectives. Groups that addressed business considerations earlier on in their strategy have done much better when it came to reducing friction, and eliminating obstacles from their road map.</p>

<h3 id="observability">Observability</h3>
<p>Almost every discussion we’ve had around governance of software infrastructure has included mentions of the importance of observability across next generation iterations. Software designed, delivered, and supported in the darkness or in isolation either fails, or is destined to become the next generation of technical debt. There were several areas of emphasis when it came to ensuring the API driven infrastructure sees the light of day from day one, and continues to operate in a way that everyone involved can see what is happening.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Out in Open</strong> - Groups who operate out in the open, sharing their progress actively with other teams, and encouraging a transparent process find higher levels of success, adoption, and consistency across their architectural efforts.</li>
  <li><strong>Co-Discovery</strong> - Ensuring that before work begins, teams are working together to discovery new ideas, learn about alternative software solutions, and working together to create buy-in, and ultimately make decisions around what gets adopted.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborative</strong> - While identified as sometimes being slower than traditional, more isolated efforts, teams who encouraged cross-team collaboration saw that their architectural decisions were sounder, more stable, and had more longevity.</li>
  <li><strong>Open Source</strong> - Following open source software development practices, and working with existing open source solutions helps ensure that enterprise software architecture last longer, has more support, and follows common standards over other more proprietary approaches.</li>
  <li><strong>Publicly</strong> - When it makes sense from a privacy and security standpoint, groups often articulate that being public by default helps ensure project teams behave differently, enjoy more accountability, and often attract external talent, domain expertise, and publicly opinion along the way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enterprise organizations that push for observability by default find that teams tend to work better together, and have a more open attitude. Attracting the right personalities, encouraging regular communication, and thinking externally by default, not as something that happens down the road. Bringing much needed sunlight and observability into processes that can often be very complex and abstract, and pushing things to speak to a wider audience beyond developer and IT groups.</p>

<h2 id="shared-process">Shared Process</h2>
<p>Having a shared process that can be communicated across teams, going beyond just technical teams, and is something that business groups, partners, 3rd party, and all other stakeholders can follow and participate in, is a regular part of newer, API-centric, software delivery life cycles. Possessing several core elements that help ensure the process for defining, designing, delivering and evolving software architecture is shared by all.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Contract</strong> - Crafting, maintaining, and consistently applying a common machine readable contract that is available in YAML format, is a common approach to ensuring there is a contract that can be used across all architectural projects, defining each solutions as an independent, business service.</li>
  <li><strong>Pipeline</strong> - Extending the machine readable service contracts with YAML defined pipeline definitions that ensure all software is delivered in a consistent, reproducible manner across many disparate teams.</li>
  <li><strong>Versioning</strong> - Establishing a common approach to versioning code, definitions, and other artifacts, providing a common semantic approach to governing how architecture is evolved in a shared manner that everyone can follow.</li>
</ul>

<p>Historically the software development and operation lifecycle is owned by IT, and development groups. Modern approaches to delivering software at scale is a shared process, including internal business and technical stakeholders, while also sharing the process with external partners, 3rd party developers, and the public. Bringing software architecture out of the shadows, and conducting it on the open web, making it more inclusive amongst all stakeholders, but done in a way that respects privacy and security along the way.</p>

<h2 id="identifying-potential-apis">Identifying Potential APIs</h2>
<p>Once the architectural foundations have been laid, there are many ways in which large enterprises begin identifying the potential APIs that should be designed, deployed, and evolved supporting the many applications that will be depending on the underlying platform architecture. Depending on the organization and it’s priorities, the reasons for how new APIs are born will vary, resulting in different lifecycles, and resulting services being delivered across internal groups, partner stakeholders, and 3rd party developers.</p>

<p>Throughout this research, we identified that there is no single approach to identifying which APIs should be delivered, but we did work to understand a variety of approaches in use across the landscape, and by the practitioners interviewed for this project. Establishing some common areas for answering the questions around what should be an API, why are we doing APIs, leading us to the how of doing APIs, and uncovering the pragmatic reasoning behind web, mobile, device, and other applications that APIs are driving across the landscape.</p>

<h3 id="existing-realities">Existing Realities</h3>
<p>Our existing realities drive the need for APIs, and reflect where we should be looking to provide new services for internal stakeholders, partners, and potentially as new revenue streams for 3rd party developers. While some APIs may be entirely new solutions, it is most likely that APIs will be born out of the realities we are already dealing with on a daily basis, based upon the digital solutions we depend on each day. We identified the most common realities that enterprise group face when it comes to their present day digital transformation challenges.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Database</strong> - The existing databases in operation are the number one place groups are identifying potential resources for deployment of APIs. Exposing historically accumulated digital assets using the web, and making them available for use in new applications, to partners, and driving new types of data products for generating the next generation of revenue streams.</li>
  <li><strong>Website</strong> - Our existing websites reflect the last 20 years of the digital evolution of our enterprises, representing the digital resources we’ve accumulated and identified as being important for sharing with partners and the public. HTML representations of our digital assets are always the 101 of API deployment, and understand what should also be available as JSON, and other more sophisticated representations.</li>
  <li><strong>Integrations</strong> - Existing software integrations, system to system integrations, are represent a rich area for understanding how digital resources are delivered, accessed, and made available throughout existing applications and systems. Providing an important landscape for mapping out when understand what should be turned into APIs, having  a more consistent process applied, eliminating custom integrations, and standardizing how systems speak with one another.</li>
  <li><strong>Applications</strong> - Exiting web, mobile, desktop and other applications can have a variety of backend system connectivity solutions, but also might have a more custom, bespoke approach to doing APIs that is off the radar when it comes to governing how infrastructure evolves. Providing another rich area for mapping out the connections behind the common applications in use, understanding the internal, partner, and 3rd party APIs and other connections they use.</li>
  <li><strong>Services</strong> - APIs have been around for a while, and exist in a variety of formats. Legacy web services, RPC, FTP, and other API and messaging formats should be mapped out and included as part of the potential API evolutionary landscape. Taking existing services, and evolving them in a consistent manner with all other API-driven services, leveraging web technologies to consistently deliver and manage digital resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Spreadsheets</strong> - The majority of business in the world still happens within the spreadsheet. These portable data stores are emailed, shared, and spread around the enterprise, and represent a rich source of information when it comes to understanding which resources should be published as APIs.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can’t govern what isn’t mapped out and known. It becomes increasingly difficult to govern software infrastructure that exists across many open and proprietary formats, and delivered as custom one-off solutions. Governance begins with a known landscape, and the greatest impedance to functional governance across organizations are the unknowns. Not knowing a solution exists, or its architectural approach being something that isn’t part of the bigger picture, leaving it to be a lone actor, in a larger landscape of known services operating in concert.</p>

<h3 id="public-presence">Public Presence</h3>
<p>Another reason for having an open, very public approach to selecting, delivering, and operating software infrastructure, is that it establishes a public presence, across web properties, social networks, and other platforms where enterprise organizations can build  community. There are a number of ways to identify potential new API resources by just being public, engaging with the community, and establishing API delivery life cycles that involve having a public presence.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>User Requests</strong> - Actively soliciting web, mobile, and developer feedback, both internally and externally is a great way to learn about potentially new API resource opportunities. Leveraging existing users as a source of insight when it comes to what services would make applications better, and demonstrating the importance of investing in an API literate user base.</li>
  <li><strong>Partner Requests</strong> - Actively working with partners, conducting regular meetings regarding digital assets and transformation, seeking feedback on what types of services would improve upon existing solutions, and strengthen partner relations. Investing in existing partners, and using them as a way to evolve the API road map, and increase their dependency on enterprise resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Public Feedback</strong> - Engaging with the public via websites, social networks, forums, and at events, to understand what opportunities are out there when it comes to delivering new API resources. Tapping public awareness around specific topics, within particular domains, and considering suggestions for new APIs outside the enterprise firewall and the traditional box.</li>
  <li><strong>Media Coverage</strong> - Tuning on to popular tech blogs, mainstream media, and other public outlets to study and understand what opportunities are emerging for the delivery of new API services. Tuning into popular trends when it comes what is happening with APIs, or business sectors that might not have caught up to some of the modern approaches to delivering APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>Feedback Loops</strong> - Cultivating trusted feedback loops with existing users, social networks, and private messaging platforms. Investing in long term feedback loops that tap the knowledge and domain expertise of trusted professionals, who can bring fresh ideas to the table when it comes to which new APIs can benefit the enterprise.</li>
  <li><strong>Negative Consequences</strong> - One significant thing to note with having a public presence, is that not everything will be positive. There are serious privacy, security, and safety concerns when operating your APIs out in the public, and there should be plenty of consideration for how to do it in a healthy way. Acknowledging that not everyone in the public domain will have the enterprise’s best interest in mind.</li>
</ul>

<p>It isn’t easy soliciting feedback from the general public when it comes to determining the direction a platform road map should head. However, with some investment, curation, and cultivation, a more reliable source of insight regarding the direction of an API platform can be established. The API community across the public and private sector has grown significantly over the last decade, providing a wealth of knowledge talent that can be tapped, if you know where to look for it.</p>

<h3 id="improvements">Improvements</h3>
<p>Moving beyond the “where to look for opportunities for APIs”, and moving into the why to find, as well as how to prioritize which resources should be turned into APIs, we hear a lot about investing in the overall improvement of the enterprise when it came to the motivations behind governance. Looking at many of the common incentives behind doing APIs, but also doing it in a more consistent and scalable way that supports the mission and forward motion of the enterprise.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Optimization</strong> - Seeking to optimize how applications are delivered, and services provided across teams. Providing consistent services that can be used across many internal groups, across partners, and that will improve the lives of 3rd party developers.</li>
  <li><strong>Common Patterns</strong> - Doing APIs, and pushing for governance to help identify common patterns across how software is designed, delivered, and managed. Working to extract the existing patterns in use, help standardize and establish the common patterns, and reenforce their usage across teams, and distributed groups.</li>
  <li><strong>Reusability</strong> - Encouraging reusability is the number one improvement we heard from different groups, and see across the landscape. Governing how software is not just delivered, but maximized, reused–ensuring the enterprise is maximizing software spend, as well as the revenue from services it delivers.</li>
  <li><strong>Acceleration</strong> - Investing in governance to help accelerate how applications are delivered, measuring, standardizing, and optimizing along the way to improve existing efforts, as well as new projects on the horizon. Increasing the speed of not just new services, but how the services are able to be put to work by developers and integrators.</li>
  <li><strong>Efficiency</strong> - Setting into motion patterns and processes that increase overall efficiency around how services are delivered, and how they enable teams to deliver on new projects, applications, integrations. Allowing IT, developers, and business users to benefit from an API focus.</li>
  <li><strong>Flexibility</strong> - Increasing the flexibility of how applications operate, and teams are able to work together and deliver across the enterprise. Encouraging the design and development of APIs that work together, and flexibly achieve organizational objectives.</li>
</ul>

<p>Providing a set of criteria that can be used to help prioritize which APIs get identified for delivery, and for evolution and versioning. If API resources help deliver on any of these areas, their benefit to the enterprise is increased, and it should be bumped up the list when looking for API opportunities. Always looking for how the enterprise can be improved upon, while also understanding which specific resources should be targeted for wrapping, and exposing as simple web APIs that can be used for both internal and external use cases.</p>

<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>The API journey is always full of challenges, and these areas of friction should be identified, and incorporated into the criteria for identifying new API solutions, as well as determining which APIs should be invested in and evolved. While some challenges can be minimized and overcome, many can also cause unnecessary friction throughout the API roadmap, making challenges something to be considered when putting together any API release strategy.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Education</strong> - What education is required when it comes to acquiring the resources behind any potential API, developing and standing up a proper API, as well as deploying, managing, and supporting an API. What challenges can be foreseen, and identified early on, helping weigh what investment in education, training, and learning along the API journey for any set of services.</li>
  <li><strong>Maturity</strong> - Understanding early on, and putting together a plan on what maturity will look like for any service, acknowledging that every service will begin in a juvenile state, and take time to harden, mature, and become something that is dependable, reliable, and usable in a production environment.</li>
  <li><strong>Isolation</strong> - Identifying resources that are being developed, maintained, and operated in isolation, and working to move them out into the mainstream. While also ensuring that any new services being developed avoid isolation, and are developed, evolved, and managed out in the open, ensuring that services never operate alone.</li>
  <li><strong>Management</strong> - Including management in discussions around which resources should be developed into APIs, including leadership in all conversations involving the targeting, evolution, and even deprecation of API services. Ensuring that the prioritization of API development is always on the radar of management, and there is a general awareness regarding the delivery of services.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistency</strong> - Realizing that while consistency is the goal, it may be an elusive, non-stop chase to actually realize consistency across teams. It should be a goal, but also realistically understanding that it won’t be easy to achieve, and while we want to strive for perfection, sometimes there will be good enough achieved for some services.</li>
  <li><strong>Reusability</strong> - Similar to consistency, reusability is an obvious goal, and should be worked towards, but it will also be elusive, and not always reliably achieved over time. There might still be redundancy for some services, and overlapping aspects of delivering services, while some areas reusability will be achievable.</li>
  <li><strong>Build It And They Will Come</strong> - There has been a significant amount of reflection regarding targeting, developing, and publishing APIs that were not needed based upon an “if you build it, they will come” mentality–where most often, nobody came, and the work was in vain.</li>
</ul>

<p>Challenges are a fact of life in the delivery of software, and evolving complex systems using APIs. Identifying challenges should be a natural part of targeting resources for delivery as APIs. Challenges can increase fiction when delivering service, and should be carefully evaluated before tackling the development of any new services. It is easy to identify the potential of new APIs, but it takes a more seasoned eye to understand potential challenges.</p>

<p>New ideas for APIs will become numerous once you begin looking. Based upon existing resources, applications, and the feedback of internal groups, partners, and the public. Along with all of the possibilities that come along, a standardized, pragmatic approach to understanding the potential, value, as well as challenges with each potential idea should be part of the equation.</p>

<h2 id="defining-data-models--standards">Defining Data Models &amp; Standards</h2>
<p>To help realize and deliver upon governance at scale it will take heavy investment in standardizing data models, and incorporating existing patterns and standards throughout the API delivery lifecycle. Many enterprise API development groups are streamlining and standardization the delivery of APIs through the adoption and development of standards across operations, which is something that is also contributing to adoption, integration and removing friction for application developers.</p>

<p>The adoption of common data models, interfaces, media types, and web standards helps contribute to the delivery of consistent APIs at scale, but they can also prove to be a challenge for some teams, and even been seen as a threat by others. There are a number of ways in which teams are pushing for standardization across their operations, and helping achieve more consistency, reuse, and the desired results across operations. Reflecting one of the strengths of web APIs, in that they employ web standards to achieve wider adoption, and the delivery of valuable resources at web scale.</p>

<h3 id="core-definitions">Core Definitions</h3>
<p>A suite of approaches have emerged in the last decade for designing, developing, evolving, and applying common API patterns across the API lifecycle. These standardized approaches to defining and delivering APIs, using common machine readable specifications, and widely used patterns, have become central to API governance discussions. Providing the fuel for the growth of the API sector to serve mobile applications, as well as the growth of other emerging channels like voice, bot automation, and the connecting of everyday objects to the net. Helping the enterprise get more organized about how services are delivered across the organization at scale.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Resource-Defined</strong> - RESTful design patterns have provided a simple approach to taking corporate resources and defining them as an intuitive, reusable, potentially web-scale stack of API resources that can be used across a variety of applications. REST provides a philosophy that can be adopted across the enterprise to help organize digital resources as a reusable stack of resources that can be discovered and put to use across many channels.</li>
  <li><strong>Schema-Driven</strong> - JSON Schema is being used to take a variety of schema and standardize them for use in RESTful API resource delivery. Providing a reusable blueprint that can be used across the request and response model for all APIs. Deriving, and standardizing existing schema in use, and making available for usage in in newly developed, and evolving APIs allows for teams to achieve many of the objectives set out as part of modern API strategies.</li>
  <li><strong>Domain Driven</strong> - The business domain is used across the enterprise for guiding the identification, development, evolution, and standardization of a variety of API definitions in use across the enterprise. Lines of business, industry definitions, and a focus on the domain helps establish areas of concern, and the separation of services, allowing for the decoupling of enterprise resources used across systems, but working in unison to deliver a single set of business objectives.</li>
  <li><strong>Legacy Abstraction</strong> - Continue movements to decouple, redefine, and evolve legacy systems is pushing forward the identification of common patterns, and pushing to map, transform, and give them new life as newer web APIs. Taking legacy databases, system interfaces, and distilling the wisdom that exists across them, to help drive the development of common standards.</li>
  <li><strong>Vocabularies</strong> - API development teams are establishing common vocabularies based upon the standardized language already in use, but also essentially taking the slang that is used in bespoke systems and helping tame it, and add it to the common lexicon when it makes sense. Providing a standard language that can be used across the enterprise to talk about services, resources, and digital assets.</li>
  <li><strong>Discovery</strong> - Many groups expressed challenges around standards not seeing the desired adoption because other teams could not find existing schema, definitions, and other existing standards. Emphasizing the importance of comprehensive, actively maintained, and evangelized catalog of core definitions across the enterprise. Providing a single, or distributed location where everyone can find and publish their common definitions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The definitions coming out of existing API development efforts are being organized into catalog, and discovery systems that can be used to guide governance efforts. Mapping out the known landscape across the enterprise, and turning it into the common patterns that can be reused across the design, development, and operation of the next generation of APIs. Distilling down the essence of the enterprise so that it can become the building blocks of an API program, while also allowing each stop along the lifecycle to be quantified, measured, and considered as part of a wider governance strategy.</p>

<h3 id="doing-business-on-the-web">Doing Business On The Web</h3>
<p>APis are built on the web. They use, and benefit from over 25 years of the evolution of the web. There are a number of elements to consider when working to identify and define common standards for use across the governance of any API program. While the API strategy should be rooted in definitions derived from the core of the enterprise, secondarily it should be embracing the web, and employing common patterns that make the web work to use as the foundation for delivering APIs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Web Standards</strong> - The web is the foundation for the delivery of APIs. Most APIs will use HTTP as a transport, and be employing URLs, HTTP verbs, headers, parameters, and other common web standards. Web standards should be part of any governance strategy to help establish common patterns and definitions for use across operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Media Types</strong> - Media types are a fundamental part of the web, and help establish message formats that will be widely recognized outside the enterprise, encouraging the reuse and adoption of APIs that employ common media types. Allowing consumers to negotiate the format that makes the most sense to their team, and the types of applications they are looking to develop.</li>
  <li><strong>Industry Schema</strong> - Industry level schema are emerging and maturing for use across API operations. Specifications like FHIR, PSD2, and other schema, along with API design patterns are evolving to help support industry focused API operations, while encouraging reuse and interoperability across disparate groups.</li>
  <li><strong>Open Source</strong> - The usage of open source software, tooling, specifications, and processes are helping deliver on the API vision across the enterprise. Web APIs reflect the open source ethos, and plays well with the delivery of web APIs. Encouraging reuse, adoption, and bringing the observability necessary to help APIs succeed.</li>
</ul>

<p>APIs are all about doing business on the web. The web provides the platform in which any API program will operate. When it comes to defining schema, standards, and common patterns for use across API operations, the web is always the beginning of the conversation. While enterprise defined patterns will always be front and center, the standards used to operate the web should always trump localized definitions, and be given priority whenever possible. Don’t reinvent the wheel when it comes to the web, always reuse and implement what is already known.</p>

<h3 id="under-the-influence">Under The Influence</h3>
<p>When learning about new standards, and considering which standards to adopt, it can be easy to find yourself under the influence of specific vendors, competing standards, programming communities, and other factors. Careful evaluation of standards is important, and an awareness of what some of the common elements are that may shift your opinions one way or another, or even obfuscate what is real and prevent you from achieving objectives.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Caught in Trends</strong> - Avoid getting caught up in the trend cycles that can often make it difficult to understand the hype around specific specifications. Do your research, understand best practices and adoption levels, and make the sensible decisions around the impact to your own efforts.</li>
  <li><strong>External Entities</strong> - While engaging with external entities, understand what their priorities are when it comes to standards and specifications. Consider what affinity may exist between enterprise objectives, and any external entity that is engaged with, and makes sure there is the right alignment, and influences are pushing efforts in the right direction.</li>
  <li><strong>Internal Demands</strong> - Similar to external entities, understand what the internal teams priorities are and don’t always assume internal requests will have the overall enterprise objectives in mind. Fully understanding what the awareness and motivation are around the implementation of specific standards, and how the fit into the overall strategy.</li>
  <li><strong>Feedback Loops</strong> - Ensure that feedback looks are diverse, and provide a wealth of opinions around what types of standards and specifications should be supported, providing the widest possible view of the landscape when it comes to adoption and investment.</li>
  <li><strong>Organic Change</strong> - Keeping an eye on vendor induced standards adoption over a more organic approach to the growth of standards, internally, as well as the outside community. Working to understand when a standard is artificially inflated, amplified, for alternative objectives beyond its core mission.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are plenty of currents to get caught up in when it comes to identifying, defining, and evolving standards. Not all will bear fruit, or realize the type of adoption they need to be successful. Establishing a balanced view of the landscape across internal, and external actors, while keeping counsel with a diverse set of voices can help ensure you understand which API specifications, standards, and definitions will help move the enterprise forward.</p>

<h3 id="taking-the-lead">Taking The Lead</h3>
<p>While there are a number of ready to use standards available for the web, and organically grown out of the API community, these standards won’t always find their way into the enterprise. Leading organizations demonstrate that it takes a structured effort to define, disseminate, educate, and evolve standards across large organizations, with a number of proven tactics for taking the lead when it comes to standardizing API infrastructure across the enterprise.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Workshops</strong> - Organizing, conducting, and growing the number of workshops held to introduce individuals across many teams to a variety of common standards and specifications.</li>
  <li><strong>Discussions</strong> - Formalizing discussions around emerging standards, and those that are in use, to help push forward awareness, and adoption of standardized approaches across groups.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> - Push teams to work together when it comes to sharing the standards in use, showcasing the investment they’ve made, and working together to understand the tooling, services, and standards being used.</li>
  <li><strong>Event Storming</strong> - Putting event storming, a rapid, lightweight group modeling technique to help accelerate the identification, evolution, and adoption of standards that meet specific team’s needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Influencers</strong> - Identifying, investing in, and cultivating influencers who exist within current groups, and encourage them to evangelize and help spread the good word about standards across the enterprise.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask Questions</strong> - Always be asking questions about the standards, or lack of standards in use across the enterprise, pushing the conversation forward at all times when it comes to standards.</li>
  <li><strong>Challenge Assumptions</strong> - Making sure teams don’t get complacent, and the status quo is always being challenged, and that the internal domain should always be rising to a higher level of standardization whenever possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>It takes standards bodies to move forward common standards at the web and industry levels, and it takes the same approach to push forward the adoption and usage of standards within the enterprise. Leading enterprise organizations are able to quantify, measure and evolve the infrastructure in a more organized way through the adoption of common schemas, specifications, and standards. Providing a common vocabulary for all teams to use when designing, deploying, and managing services that can be used consistently across the enterprise, and its public interests.</p>

<h2 id="development-to-production">Development to Production</h2>
<p>After understanding the roles needed to realize governance, more about the underlying platform architecture that is needed, how organizations can identify where the API opportunities are, and making sure groups are putting standards to work, we scrutinized how groups are moving APIs from development to production in a more structured way. Governing how teams are efficiently moving APIs from idea and design, to actually putting services to work in a production environment at scale across large teams. Documenting the lifecycle of a service, and the common elements of how enterprises are getting the job done on a regular basis.</p>

<h3 id="well-defined">Well Defined</h3>
<p>To be able to deliver APIs at scale in a consistent way teams are relying on a well honed, well defined lifecycle that has been defined, proven, and evolved by senior teams. Forcing structure and rigor throughout the evolution of all services, putting governance in front of teams, and forcing them to execute in a consistent way if they expect to reach a production reality with their services. Focusing on a handful of structured formats for imposing governance at the deployment levels.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Contract</strong> - Requiring ALL services begin with a machine readable OpenAPI contract defining the entire surface area of the API and its schema. Leveraging the contract as the central truth for what the service will deliver, and how governance will be measured throughout the lifecycle of the service.</li>
  <li><strong>Process</strong> - Providing a well defined process for all developers laying out how any service moves from design to production, with as much detail regarding each step along the way. Helping all developers understand what they will face as they work to move their services forward in the enterprise.</li>
  <li><strong>Scorecard</strong> - Having a machine readable checklist and scorecard, with tooling to help each developer fork or establish an instance for their service. Providing a checklist of everything they need to consider, that allows them to check off what has been done, what is left to be done, and providing a definition that can be used to define and report upon governance along the way.</li>
  <li><strong>Cycles</strong> - Provide a variety of cycles that every service will need to go to before they will be production worthy, forcing developers to iterate upon their services, harden and mature them before they will be considered ready for production.</li>
  <li><strong>Reviews</strong> - Require all services go through a series of lifecycle reviews by other teams, pushing service owners to present their work to each review team, and work with them to satisfy any concerns, and make sure it meets all governance criteria.</li>
  <li><strong>Clinics</strong> - Providing developers with a variety of clinics where they can receive feedback on their work, improve upon their service, and improve the health of their work before submitting it for inclusion in a production environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enterprise organizations that provide structure for API development teams find it much easier to realize their governance aspirations. The scaffolding is already there to think about the consistency of services, and the face to face, and virtual scrutiny of services helps provide the environment for governance practices to be executed, enforced, and evolved before any service reaches a production state. A well defined API deployment lifecycle will help contribute to a well defined API governance practice.</p>

<h3 id="virtualization">Virtualization</h3>
<p>One sign of enterprise groups who are further along in their governance journeys is when there are virtualized environments being put to use. Requiring all API developers to mock and iterate upon their APIs in a virtualized environment, presenting them as if they are real, before they ever are given a license to write any code, let alone reach a production state for their services.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mocking</strong> - Creating mock APIs for all endpoints, virtualizing every aspect of the surface area of an API, allowing a service to be iterated upon early on in its lifecycle.</li>
  <li><strong>Data</strong> - Requiring virtualized and synthesized data be present for all mocked APIs, returning realistic data with responses, reflecting behavior encountered in a production environment.</li>
  <li><strong>Sandbox</strong> - Providing a complete labs and sandbox environment for developers to publish their mocked APIs into, reflecting what they’ll encounter in a production environment, but done in a much more safer and secure way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Virtualized environments provide an important phase in the journey for APIs moving from concept to reality. Establishing a safe environment for developers to iterate upon their work, encounter many of the challenges they’ll face in a public environment, without any of the potential for harm to users or the platform. Ensuring that when a service is ready for development, most of the rough edges have been worked out of the service contract, and for the team behind.</p>

<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<p>One of the most significant ways in which we’ve found enterprise groups governing the evolution of their APIs is through the technology they employ. This technology is providing much of the structure and discipline that organizations are depending on to help ensure that APIs are being developed, and ultimately deployed in a consistent manner. Bringing most of the governance to the table for some organizations who haven’t begun moving their governance strategy forward as a formal approach.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Authentication</strong> - Requiring standard-based approaches to authentication using Basic Auth, API keys, OAuth, and JWT. Ensuring the teams understand when to use which protocol, and how to properly configure, and use as part of larger API governance strategy.</li>
  <li><strong>Framework</strong> - Relying on the programming frameworks in use to inject discipline into the process, dictating the governance of how APIs are delivered before they are ready for a production environment.</li>
  <li><strong>Gateway</strong> - Applying the policies and structure necessary to govern API services as they are made available in a production environment. Many groups also had a sandbox or development edition of their gateway emulating many of the same elements that will be found in a production world.</li>
  <li><strong>Management</strong> - Similar to the gateway, groups are relying on their API management layers to help govern what APIs do, providing transformations, policy templates, and a wide variety of other standardization that occurs prior to being made available in production sense.</li>
  <li><strong>Vendor</strong> - The reliance on technology to deliver governance at the API deployment level gives a lot of control to vendors when it comes to governing the API lifecycle. If a vendor doesn’t provide a specific way of doing things, it may not exist within some groups. Dictating what is governance for many enterprise groups.</li>
  <li><strong>Tooling</strong> - Most groups have an arsenal of open source, and custom developed tooling for helping push code from development to production, validating, scanning, transforming, shaping, and hardening code and interfaces to be ready for production usage.</li>
  <li><strong>Encryption</strong> - Requiring encryption by default for storage, and in transport, using technology to ensure security is a default parameter for everything that is exposed publicly. Reducing the possibility of a breach, and minimizing the damage when one does occur.</li>
</ul>

<p>Demonstrating how important the technological choices we make, and the architectural planning we discussed earlier is to the overall API governance conversations. The services, tooling, and applications we adopt will either contribute, or will not contribute to our governance practices. Potentially enforcing governance for all APIs as they move from development to production, in a way that teams cannot circumvent, and often times don’t even notice is occurring behind the scenes.</p>

<h3 id="orchestration">Orchestration</h3>
<p>Augmenting the core technology, there are a number of orchestration practices we found that help quantify and enforce governance on the road from development to production. Dictating how code, artifacts, and other elements included as part of the API lifecycle move forward, evolve, or possibly get held back until specific requirements are met to meet wider governance criteria.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pipeline</strong> - CI/CD services, tooling, and mindset have introduced a pipeline workflow for many teams, standardizing the API delivery process as an executable, repeatable, measurable pipeline that can be realized across any team.</li>
  <li><strong>Stages</strong> - The defining of clear stages that exist after development, but before production, requiring quality assurance, security reviews, compliance audits, and other relevant governance practices to be realized.</li>
  <li><strong>Hooks</strong> - Well defined pre and post commit hooks for all service repositories, requiring that governance is applied throughout a service’s pipeline, and are default for all services, no matter which organization they emerge from.</li>
  <li><strong>Devops</strong> - Pushing that all teams are competent, and skilled enough to execute on behalf of their services from beginning to end, owning and executing at every stage of the life cycle. Reducing the need for reliance on special teams, and eliminating bottlenecks.</li>
  <li><strong>Logging</strong> - Identifying the logging capabilities of the entire stack for each service being delivered. Making sure logging is turned on for everything, and all logs are shipped to a central location for auditing, and when possible real time analysis and response.</li>
</ul>

<p>Orchestration provides some clarity on the automation side of moving services from development to production, while also enforcing governance along the way. Allowing for an assembly line delivery of consistent services, and the iteration of each version, in alignment with the overall governance strategy. Reducing the chance for human error, and increasing the chance for consistent execution of the enterprise API strategy at scale across many different teams.</p>

<h3 id="the-legal-department">The Legal Department</h3>
<p>Beyond the technology, the legal department should have a significant influence over APIs going from development to production. Providing a structured framework that can generally apply across all services easily, but also providing granular level control over the fine tuning of legal documents for specific services and use cases. With a handful of clear building blocks in use to help govern the delivery of APIs from the legal side of the equation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Terms of Services</strong> - Have universally applicable, and modular, as well as possibly machine readable, and human readable terms of service governing all services from a central location.</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy Policy</strong> - Have universally applicable, and modular, as well as possibly machine readable, and human readable privacy governing all services from a central location, protecting all platform users from harm.</li>
  <li><strong>Security Policy</strong> - Provide a comprehensive security policy that governs how services are secured, reflecting the technologies, checklists, tooling, and reviews that are in use by all team members, providing an overview for all stakeholders to understand.</li>
  <li><strong>Licensing</strong> - Establish clear code, data, and interface licensing to be used across the entire API stack, allowing developers to properly license their services, as well as understand the provenance for the systems and services they depend on.</li>
  <li><strong>Server Level Agreements</strong> - Have universally applicable, modular, as well as possibly machine readable, and human readable service level agreement (SLA) that can be applied across all services, measured, and reported upon as part of wider governance strategy.</li>
  <li><strong>Scopes</strong> - Define and publish the OAuth access scopes as part of a formal set of legal guidance regarding what data is accessible via services, and the role users and developers play in managing scope that is defined by the platform.</li>
</ul>

<p>The legal department will play an important role in governing APIs as they move from development to production, and there needs to be clear guidance for all developers regarding what is required. Similar to the technical, and business elements of delivering services, the legal components need to be easy to access, understand, and apply, but also make sure and protect the interests of everyone involved with the delivery and operation of enterprise services.</p>

<h2 id="making-apis-available-to-consumers">Making APIs Available to Consumers</h2>
<p>The next step in the life cycle of properly governed APIs is making them available to consumer after they’ve been published to a production environment. The governing of APIs is not limited to the technical side of things, and this is where we begin understanding how to consistently deliver, measure, and understand the impact of API resources across the many consumers who are integrating the valuable resources into their applications. Shining a light on the business and politics of how digital assets are being put to use across the enterprise.</p>

<p>This portion of this governance research is intended to provide a basic list of the building blocks used by enterprise groups to help reduce friction when putting APIs to work, but also make sense of how consumers are using API resources, establishing a feedback loop that guide the road map for the future of the platform. Taking us back to the beginning of this research and informing how we should be targeting the development of new APIs, the evolution of existing services, and in many cases the deprecation and archiving of services. Ensuring governance goes well beyond the technical details, and making sure they are benefitting the platform, as well as consumers.</p>

<h3 id="known-consumers">Known Consumers</h3>
<p>Making your APIs available to consumers requires doing a lot of research on who you are marketing them to, and positioning yourself to speak to an intended audience. Tailoring not just the design of your APIs, but the overall presentation, messaging, and even portal, documentation, and other building blocks to speak to a particular audience. For many API providers, APIs might be made available to multiple audience, in a variety of ways, based upon knowing their customers, and presenting exactly the resources they are needing to get a specific job done.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Studies</strong> - Conducting regular stories about what internal, partner, and public user groups are using, and needing when it comes to developing applications, and integrating systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Landscape</strong> - Establishing an understanding of the industry landscape for the area being targeted by services, and regularly tuning into and refining the understanding of what consumers are using across that landscape.</li>
  <li><strong>B2B</strong> - Positioning the API to speak to a B2B audience, providing separate portal, documentation, and other resources to cater to a business audience.</li>
  <li><strong>B2C</strong> - Positioning the API to speak to a B2C audience, providing separate portal, documentation, and other resources to cater to a consumer audience.</li>
  <li><strong>Partners</strong> - Providing a unique set of resources that speak to partner groups, providing separate portal, documentation, and other resources to cater to exactly what existing partners will be needing.</li>
  <li><strong>Internal</strong> - Positioning the API to speak to internal groups, providing separate portal, documentation, and other resources to cater to the needs of development groups within the enterprise.</li>
  <li><strong>Context</strong> - Making sure services have knowledge of the context in which they will be delivering resources into. Different patterns, processes, and practices work well within different context, while others will fail, depending on the context that is relevant to the consumer.</li>
  <li><strong>Office Hours</strong> - Holding conference call, or virtual office hours for different consumer groups to be available for discussion around what APIs are available, their supporting resources, as well as contributing to the platform road map.</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing your existing, and potential API consumers is essential to position your API program to speak to its intended targets. It is difficult to design and present the right set of resources for an audience you do not understand. Demonstrating how knowing your consumers is something that should happen before you begin the development of services, as well as an ongoing features of a platform, and that understanding the challenges of your consumer, and shifting the road map to stay in alignment with your consumer audience is critical to realizing platform-wide governance</p>

<h3 id="common-patterns">Common Patterns</h3>
<p>While studying the consumer outreach strategies of leading API providers, as well as the ones that were interviewed, there are common patterns at play defining how to best reach your audience. The consistency of governed APIs speaks to how to best reach a wide audience, helps increase the impact APIs will have in the applications they are use in, and reduce overall friction and support required to operate them. There are several common patterns present when looking at how organizations are presenting APIs to their consumers publicly and privately.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>API Design</strong> - The design of APIs, using common RESTful resource design patterns, helps present simple, intuitive, and familiar resources that speak to a wide as possible audience.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer Portals</strong> - Consistently designed, easy to navigate, well branded portals provide a familiar, known destination in which consumers can discover, onboard, and stay in touch with where an API platform is going.</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Using common open source documentation across APIs provides an interactive, hands-on way for developers to learn about APIs, understand how to integrate with them, and be able to regularly check back in for added features and benefits that they provide.</li>
  <li><strong>Definitions</strong> - Providing machine readable OpenAPI, and Postman Collections for consumers gives them a portable definition of what an API does, which they can use in their client tooling, to generate code libraries, setup monitors, tests, and generally understand what is possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Common design and presentation patterns is one of the reasons many of the leading API providers have established their foothold with their consumers. When you study the approach of Amazon, Google, Twitter, Twilio, Stripe, and other leading API providers, you see that they all use consistent design patterns, as well as provide similar portals, documentation, and other resources for their consumers. Governing the presentation layer for their API driven services, which reflects the consistency consumers are used to when working with multiple API providers across even different business sectors.</p>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p>The next aspect of presenting production APIs to consumers involves communication, and ensuring that all stakeholders are kept up to speed on what is happening. Keeping a steady stream of information flowing around the platform, blending it with, and encouraging the activity on feedback loops, with an intent to drive the platform road map.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Updates</strong> - Providing updates on a blog, or other mechanism, helping keep consumers up to date on what is going on with the platform, and making sure everyone knows there is someone home.</li>
  <li><strong>Roadmaps</strong> - Publishing a public roadmap for API consumers to help them understand what is being planned, and what the future holds. Also maintaining private versions of road map for internal groups, and potentially partners.</li>
  <li><strong>Issues</strong> - Being transparent and communicative around what the current known issues are with a platform, and publishing a list of anything current.</li>
  <li><strong>Change Logs</strong> - Translated the road map, and issues into a change log for the platform showcasing what has historically occurred via a platform.</li>
  <li><strong>Showcase</strong> - A published listing of applications and developers, showcasing the work being done by API consumers, highlighting the value a platform brings to the table.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maintaining a steady stream of communication around what is happening with an API platform is a clear signal coming from the strongest enterprise API platforms out there. You see regular communication around what is happening, and what is being worked on, with teams reach out to each other, and sharing healthy practices, challenges, and showcasing what is being done with their API resources.</p>

<h2 id="realizing-api-governance">Realizing API Governance</h2>
<p>Everything covered so far in this document feeds into what should be considered as part of the overall governance of an API platform, but focuses on the actual delivery of APIs. This is the section where we look at what is needed specifically for governance, and what teams are doing to invest in the governance of APIs across their teams, projects, and the lifecycle of their operations. There are a number of areas we identified that were relevant for groups who are actively realizing governance across their operations.</p>

<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
<p>One key component of API governance at enterprise organizations who have been doing it a while, and have made significant investment in their efforts, is the presence of organized structure and teams dedicated to advancing governance across the enterprise. While these organizational structures are often defined by many different names, they have some common elements worth noting.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Organization</strong> - Establishing a formal organization within the enterprise that is dedicated to API infrastructure, and developing a structured approach to governance, and the shared strategy across all teams.</li>
  <li><strong>Core Team</strong> - Beginning with a small, focused, core team within the API strategy and governance, then expanding and growing as it makes sense, and based upon the expansion across the larger enterprise.</li>
  <li><strong>Enablement Team</strong> - Providing an enablement team that can go out and work with individual teams to help enable them to realize healthier API lifecycle practices, and achieve governance objectives.</li>
  <li><strong>Advisory Board</strong> - Developing an advisory board of internal, and possibly external individuals who can provide regular feedback on the API strategy, and help move forward the governance conversation.</li>
  <li><strong>Legacy Teams</strong> - Involving legacy teams in the central API strategy and governance team to make sure the legacy of the enterprise is reflected and understood as efforts evolve and move forward</li>
</ul>

<p>There were many variations in how enterprise organizations are organizing their API teams, some with more of a centralized approach, with others possessing a decentralized, and more organic feel. Some come straight out of CIO and CTO groups, where others were more bottom-up, organically grown efforts, reflecting the tone of the conversation occurring at different types of enterprise organizations.</p>

<h3 id="the-approach">The Approach</h3>
<p>While there were a number of approaches used to organize and execute on the API governance vision across different enterprise, there were some common approaches, and advice regarding how to do it in a pragmatic way. Providing some key elements to consider as organizations think about forming their own strategy, and putting it into motion at their own enterprise organizations.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Start Simple</strong> - Keeping things as simple as possible when getting going. Not trying to bite off more than you can chew, and overpromising to the organization. Start with the basics, get involvement, and buy-in, then move forward in a logical fashion.</li>
  <li><strong>Not Heavy Handed</strong> - Refrain from being heavy handed with governance policing and enforcement. It is repeatedly stated that heavy handed efforts get an overwhelming amount of pushback, and can set back efforts significantly.</li>
  <li><strong>Inline Defined</strong> - Provide guidance, education, and artifacts inline. Do not expect people to read governance guides, and understand what is going on from the start. Feed them information on a regular basis through the channels they are already tuned into include corporate communication channels, their integrated development environments (IDE), and other existing entry points people will stay tuned on.</li>
  <li><strong>Having A Mandate</strong> - Think deeply about having a mandate regarding governance. Some people think it is better stated as a mission, rather than a mandate. Considering the negative impact a mandate might have when it comes to adoption, and participation.</li>
  <li><strong>Select Enforcement</strong> - Be creative in how you enforce governance across operations. Be very selective about where you enforce and push back on users. Finding inspiring, and motivational ways to enforce governance, being more carrot than stick.</li>
  <li><strong>Build Community</strong> - Working to build community around the API strategy and governance organization, building relationships across teams, recruiting advocates, and working to train and education on a regular basis.</li>
  <li><strong>Evangelism</strong> - Spending a significant amount of time reaching out to internal stakeholders, partner contacts, also the public when it makes sense, but most importantly, always be evangelizing to management and leadership.</li>
</ul>

<p>Moving beyond just a group of people in name only and having an structured and planned approach to executing on the API governance across an organization on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual basis. Establishing a deliberate tone to the API governance effort, measuring it’s impact across groups, and adjusting and evolving as required. Developing a strong voice, and measured approach over time, while understanding what works, and what doesn’t work-being agile and flexible in how APIs are governed.</p>

<h3 id="technology-1">Technology</h3>
<p>Building upon the technological layers present in every previous section of this report, we wanted to take another look at how technology is used specifically for defining, measuring, and reporting on governance efforts. Tracking on the specific technological solutions that enterprise groups are using to understand, as well as enforce the governance strategy on the ground, in real time.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Definitions</strong> - Use OpenAPI, Postman Collections, JSON Schema, and other machine readable artifacts available for all stages of the API lifecycle to quantify, measure, and report on how well governance efforts are being realized.</li>
  <li><strong>Management</strong> - The API management layer provides a number of features that help apply policies, rate limit, log, and track on what is happening with all APIs. Primarily used to understand consumer behavior, but can also be used to understand provider, publisher, and developer behavior as well.</li>
  <li><strong>Gateway</strong> - Providing the single point of entry for all services, allowing for transformation, translation, as well as all the features brought to the table by API management solutions. Providing the perfect opportunity to enforce, as well as measure how well governance is being applied across the organization.</li>
  <li><strong>Logging</strong> - Logs shipped centrally will be the most important way that governance efforts measures and reports on what is happening across the enterprise platform. Without a central logging strategy, governance will be flying blind, unable to see into all the services it is supposed to be governing.</li>
  <li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - Making the monitoring of ALL services the default. Tracking all services from multiple regions, and understanding if they are meeting internal or external SLAs. Providing a key benchmark for whether governance is being effective across services.</li>
  <li><strong>Testing</strong> - Getting much more granular and making sure that APIs are doing what they should. Taking plain business assertions, and testing them against APIs using machine-defined tests that can be executed in real-time, and on a schedule.</li>
  <li><strong>Security</strong> - Gathering as much data as possible about how security is being handled, and the results of scanning, monitoring, logging, and authentication around security checkpoints.</li>
  <li><strong>Reporting</strong> - Leverage management, gateway, monitoring, testing and other technology to produce reports on how well governance benchmarks are being met. Allowing the technology to do the measurement and enforcement, as well as reporting of the numbers that can be aggregated into a single set of reports to understand the impact of governance efforts.</li>
</ul>

<p>When making decision on what technology to use as part of the delivery of API infrastructure, it’s role in the wider governance strategy should be considered. Having services and tooling inline, that can help execute and report upon governance efforts is an important aspect of being able to move forward a governance program across the enterprise. Built in governance is much more likely to be leveraged, than externally mandated tracking and reporting.</p>

<h3 id="challenges-1">Challenges</h3>
<p>Every organization we talked to shared their frustrations and stories around the challenges they’ve faced. Many of these have been shared as part of specific section above, but we wanted to focus on the challenges with actually implementing governance itself, and look at some of the solutions groups have found for working around challenges and roadblocks.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Co-Creation</strong> - Isolated API governance organizations stayed isolated, and groups who co-created the strategy with other teams, and worked to share ownership over the strategy, execution, and road map had much better success meeting their objectives.</li>
  <li><strong>Buy-In</strong> - Getting buy-in from teams is difficult, and many have spoke of the challenges getting buy-in to the need for a centralized, or even distributed governance approach. Making it difficult to move forward when you don’t have the buy-in of some groups or management.</li>
  <li><strong>Standards</strong> - While many agreed standards were good, actually getting people on the ground to adopt, use, and realize the benefits of standards across all stops along the API lifecycle has proven elusive.</li>
  <li><strong>Artifacts</strong> - There just wasn’t agreement that definitive governance artifacts like guides, prototypes, and other common solutions were necessary. Some teams just disregard these artifacts, questioning the investment of time and energy to create. While others felt strongly that they were necessary to lead through example.</li>
  <li><strong>Difficult Process</strong> - Over and over, API teams express that governance, and pushing for consistency across the API lifecycle was a difficult process. It sounds easy when you plan the strategy, but actually doing it on the ground never works out as you envision.</li>
  <li><strong>Refine Process</strong> - You will be constantly refining your governance strategy, adjusting, removing, tweaking, and shifting the approach until you find solutions to incremental aspects of delivering APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>Takes Time</strong> - All of this will take time. Be patient. Play the long game. Understand it will take much longer than you expected to see the change you envision.</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be more challenges along the way than there will be wins, when it comes to governance of vast, complex API infrastructure. Challenges, roadblocks, and friction will exist at all stages of standardizing how APIs are delivered across the enterprise. Dealing with failure, and recognizing challenges and the potential for them to be a roadblock is important to being able to keep moving forward at any pace.</p>

<h2 id="the-road-to-api-governance">The Road To API Governance</h2>
<p>There has been a significant uptick in the number of companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies doing APIs since 2010, to meet the demands of web, mobile, and device applications. A very small percentage of these entities have any sort of formal governance strategy in motion to address how APIs will be delivered across their organizations. Most API providers are living in the moment, realizing they need to be addressing governance, but struggling to overcome a handful of common roadblocks.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>People</strong> - A lack of awareness, training, and communication amongst stakeholders is the biggest challenge API governance efforts face. Do not underestimate the people when crafting a technology focused effort, otherwise the people variable will be what brings it down.</li>
  <li><strong>Culture</strong> - Plan for how the governance will address the culture within an organization. This is where the studies, outreach, workshops, and planning will come into play. Plan for everything taking 5 to 10 times longer than you anticipate because of the thickness, and resistance of organizational culture.</li>
  <li><strong>Problems</strong> - Count on problems coming up everywhere. Dedicate a significant amount of time and resources to identifying, thinking through, and address problems that come up. Do not let problems fester, go ignored, or address.</li>
  <li><strong>Existing</strong> - Map API governance efforts to the existing realities. Yes, the objective is to move the delivery of APIs to a specific destination, but the strategy needs to be rooted in what is existing, building a bridge to where we want to be.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all organizations will be ready for capital “G” governance, and many will have to accept inline, ongoing, lower case “g” governance. Doing what they can, with what resources they have, evangelizing, building community, and consensus along the way. While an organized, centralized, well funded governance program is ideal, and can achieve a lot, a significant amount can be done with a scrappier approach, until more traction and resources are achieved.</p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>
<p>This report pulls together several years of research, combined with a handful of interviews with API professionals who are pushing forward the API governance conversation at their enterprise organizations. It acknowledges that the discipline of API governance is more discussion, than it is a formal discipline as of 2018. There are many ways in which API providers are governing their APIs, but few that have a formalized API governance strategy and program, and even fewer that are sharing their strategy, or lack of one in a public manner.</p>

<p>The objective with this report is to pull together as much information regarding how organizations are governing their APIs, and assemble the findings in the following logical order, reflecting how an organization might approach governance on the ground:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Roles Within An Organization</strong> - Who is needed to make this happen?</li>
  <li><strong>Design Software Architecture</strong> - Laying the foundation for governance.</li>
  <li><strong>Identifying Potential APIs</strong> - Defining the right resources to expose.</li>
  <li><strong>Defining Data Models &amp; Standards</strong> - working to standardize how things are done.</li>
  <li><strong>Development to Production</strong> - Moving from idea to reality in a standard way.</li>
  <li><strong>Making APIs Available to Consumers</strong> - Exposing resources properly to consumers.</li>
  <li><strong>Realizing API Governance</strong> - Moving towards a structured vision of governance.</li>
  <li><strong>The Road To API Governance</strong> - Acknowledging governance is more vision than reality.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not every detail in this report will apply to the VA, or any other enterprise organization looking to establish a wider API governance strategy. It is meant to be educational, enlightening, and show the scope of how enterprise groups are addressing governance. Allowing enterprise API efforts to learn from each other, and hopefully even share more stories regarding the challenges they face, and the success they are finding–no matter how small.</p>

<p>Hopefully this report reflects a patchwork of things that should be considered, rather than a complete list of what has to be done. There is no such thing as the perfect governance strategy for any API program. There is however, a great deal of things that can be done when you have the right team, the right amount of enthusiasm, and a positive outlook on what governance means. Addressing early on some of the negative perceptions that will exist out there about governance, and how it is something that comes from the top, and how it has the potential to not give regular people at the front lines a voice in the process–this is a myth, it doesn’t have to be the reality.</p>

<p>A definition for governance from the Oxford English Dictionary is, “the way in which an organization is managed at the highest level, and the systems for doing this”. Don’t mistake the highest level being about the highest levels of management, and let it be more about the highest levels of strategy across the organization. It is the system for governing a complex machine of API driven gears that make systems and applications work across the enterprise. It is the governance of a machine that has the potential to allow every individual within the enterprise to play an important role in influencing, allowing everyone to contribute, even if they do not work in a technical capacity within the enterprise machine.</p>

<p>One of the layers of the API universe where I come across an increased number Hypermedia APIs is in the movie, television, and entertainment space. Where having a more flowing API experience makes a lot of sense, and the extra investment in link relations will pay off. One example of this I recently came across was over at TVMaze, <a href="https://www.tvmaze.com/api">who has a pretty robust hypermedia API</a>, where they opted for using HAL as their media type.</p>

<p>Like any good hypermedia should, TVMaze begins with its root URL: http://api.tvmaze.com, and provides a robust set of endpoints from there:</p>

<p>The TVMaze API isn’t an overly complex hypermedia API. I think it is simple, elegant, and shows how you can use link relations to establish a more meaningful experience for API consumers. Allowing you to navigate the large, ever-changing catalog of television shows, allowing the API client to do the heavy lifting of navigating the shows, schedules, and people involved with each production.</p>

<p>There hasn’t been enough showcasing of the <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia APIs</a> available out there. Usually once a year I remember to give the subject some attention, or when I come across interesting ones like TVMaze. Hypermedia isn’t just an academic idea anymore, and is something that has gotten traction in a number of sectors, and I keep seeing signs of growth and adoption. I don’t think it will be the API solution most hypermedia believers envisioned it, but I do think it is a viable tool in our API toolbox, and for the right projects it makes a lot of sense.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jul 2018</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope/builder/filtered/80_86_800_500_0_max_0_1_-1.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>While profiling any company, a couple of the Google searches I will execute right away are for “[Company Name] Swagger” and “[Company Name] OpenAPI”, hoping that a provide is progressive enough to have published an OpenAPI definition–saving me hours of work understanding what their API does. I’ve added a third search to my toolbox, if these other two searches do not yield results, searching for “[Company Name] Postman”, revealing whether or not a company has published a Postman Collection for their API–another sign of a progressive, outward thinking API provider in my book.</p>

<p>A machine readable definition for an API tells me more about what a company, organization, institution, or government agency does, than anything else I can dig up on their website, or social media profiles. An OpenAPI definition or Postman Collection is a much more honest view of what an organization does, than the marketing blah blah that is often available on a website. Making machine readable definitions something I look for almost immediately, and prioritize profiling, reviewing, and understanding the entities I come across with a machine readable definition, over those that do not. I only have so much time in a day, and I will prioritize an entity with an OpenAPI or Postman, over those who do not.</p>

<p>The presence of an OpenAPI and / or Postman Collection isn’t just about believing in the tooling benefits these definitions provide. It is about API providers thinking externally about their API consumers. I’ve met a lot of API providers who are dismissive of these machine readable definitions as trends, which demonstrates they aren’t paying attention to the wider API space, and aren’t thinking about how they can make their API consumers lives easier–they are focused on doing what they do. In my experience these API programs tend to not grow as fast, focus on the needs of their integrators and consumers, and often get shut down after they don’t get the results they thought they’d see. APIs are all about having that outward focus, and the presence of OpenAPI and Postman Collection are a sign that a provider is looking outward.</p>

<p>While I’m heavily invested in OpenAPI (I am member), I’m also invested in Postman. More importantly, I’m invested in supporting well defined APIs that provide solutions to developers. When an API has an OpenAPI for delivering mocks, documentation, testing, monitoring, and other solutions, and they provide a Postman Collection that allows you to get up an running making API calls in seconds or minutes, instead of hours or days–it is an API I want to know more about. Making these potential searches the deciding factor between whether or not I will continue profiling and reviewing an API, or just flagging it for future consideration, and moving on to the next API in the queue. I can’t keep up with the number of APIs I have in my queue, and it is signals like this that help me prioritize my world, and get my work done on a regular basis.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jul 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories-new/old-door-lock_smoking_cigarette.jpg" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>It is interesting for me to still regularly come across so many API providers who have a public API portals, but insist on keeping most of their documentation behind a login. Stating that they are concerned with competitors getting access to the design of their API and the underlying schema. Revealing some indefensible API business models, and general paranoia around doing business on the web. Something that usually is a sign for me of a business that is working really hard to maintain a competitive grip within an industry, without actually having to do the hard work of innovating and moving the conversation forward.</p>

<p>Confident API providers know that you can put your API documentation out in the open, complete with schema, without giving away the farm. If your competition can take your API design, and underlying schema, and recreate your business–you should probably go back to the drawing board, and come up with a new business idea. Your API and schema definition is not your business. I’ve used this comparison may times–your API docs are like a restaurant menu. Can you imagine restaurants that kept them hidden until they were sure you are going to be a customer? If you think that your competition can read your menu and recreate all your dishes, then you won’t be in business very long, because your dishes probably weren’t that special to begin with.</p>

<p>For every competitor you keep out of your API documentation, you are keeping twenty new customers out as well. I’m guessing that your savvy competitors are going to be able to get in anyways with a fake account, or otherwise. Don’t waste your time on hiding your API and keeping it out of the view of your potential customers–invest your energy in making sure your APIs kick ass. To use the restaurant analogy again, make sure ingredients are the best, and your processes, and your service are top notch. Don’t make your menu hard to get, it just shows how out of touch you are with the mainstream world of APIs, and your worst fears will come true–someone will come along and do what you do, but even better, and you will become irrelevant.</p>

<p>Be proud of your APIs, and publish them prominently in your API portal. Make sure you have a OpenAPI definition handy, driving your documentation, tests, monitors, and other elements of your operations. Also make sure you have Postman Collections available, allowing your API definition to be portable and importable into the Postman client, allowing consumers to get up and running making calls in minutes, not hours or days. Get out of the way of your API consumers, don’t put up unnecessary, outdated obstacles in their way. I know that you feel you know best because you’ve been doing this for so long, and know your industry, but the world is moving on, and APIs are about doing business on the web in a much more open, accessible, and self-service way. If you aren’t moving in this direction, I’m guessing you won’t be doing what you do for much longer, because someone will come along who can move faster and be more open.</p>

<p>I’m regularly fascinated with API development teams I work with expressing their concern with working with many Github repositories. With all of the complexity I watch teams embrace when it comes to frameworks, scaffolding, continuous integration, deployment, and orchestration solutions, I’m lost on why many Github repositories suddenly become such a challenge. A Github organization is a folder, and a Github repository is a folder, that you can check out locally, on your server, or work with via an API, or Git. It is a distributed file store, that you can orchestrate with programmatically, and can be as logical or illogical as you design it to be.</p>

<p>I work really hard to keep technical complexity to a minimum in my world, but this means limiting unnecessary vendor lock-in, and tech just because it is the latest trend. For me, Git is just a distributed file system, with version control built in, with Github providing a nice API and network effect layer that makes it compelling. Referencing a Github folder is just a matter of using its org and repo name, checking it out, and working with the standardized layout of information I have published there. Allowing me to work with, and orchestrate thousands of separate folders (repos), across almost 50 organizations (folders), in a consistent way, as a one person team. Something that has taken me about four years to setup, and fine tune, but has become essential to what I do on a daily basis.</p>

<p>I’m not saying working with hundreds or thousands of individual Github repositories can’t be complex, or doesn’t take a significant amount of work. I’m just saying I’m intrigued by how technologists who manage large systems, adopt complex frameworks for delivering simple web solutions, and regularly make other complex technological investments, draw the line here. I see Github as a robust file store, with two doorways, 1) Git, and 2) API. I have a standardized structure to what I store on Github, something that is similar to my Amazon S3 store, or my backend of databases, and is something that takes discipline to maintain and keep from being unwieldy, but if I do the hard work it is possible. I’m guessing folks who see Github as a lot of work are seeing it through a web or desktop UI lens, and haven’t stopped to think about through an API or CLI lens–I find my AWS, Google, and other platforms to be complicated if I only look at them through the UI.</p>

<p>I enjoy being able to checkout and work with the relevant repositories in my world, and automate my backend and front end systems to automate with the same repositories. My blog schedules, checks out, and publishes posts across 250 repositories. My curation system pulls from my Feedly every day, organizing what I’ve bookmarked and tagged across almost 500 repositories. My API system updates and publishes APIs.json, OpenAPI, and Postman collections across almost 4,000 separate repositories, as I discovery, profile, and make sense of the API landscape. I don’t see this as complexity, I see it as pretty simple, Git, Jekyll, HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, and YAML driven goodness. Something I can easily migrate off of Github if I wanted, and run on AWS, Google, Azure, or my own server infrastructure. For now I’m enjoying the network effect provided by Github, and the power of their API when it comes to more granular changes, and tuning into valuable signals that are available via the social platform.</p>

<p>The conversations I’m having around the complexities of managing many Github repositories are a reminder for me of how technological complexity is relative. Some will see opportunity, while others see complexity, and vice versa. If you understand something, there is a lesser chance you will see complexity–you’ve made the investment already. For many, Github is a burden. I see it as liberating, and something to be orchestrated, providing me with some of the most significant signals I can find online–rivaling Twitter when it comes to driving my work. I can see managing Github through the web or desktop interface being pretty cumbersome, but once you’ve elevated beyond these tools, and work with repositories using the API and CLI, taking full advantage of the Git in Github, the landscape changes, and become less complex, and a more empowering experience. Something I don’t think everyone will fully realize, and be able to get beyond their view of Github as complex, difficult, and challenging. And, thats ok.</p>

<p>Ultimately the API Discovery (APIs.json) document is the heartbeat for this service checklist, which resides in the root of the Github repository will provide the machine readable index for reporting and governance, while also driving the human readable interface that is accessible via the service portal, which is driven by Jekyll running in Github Pages. Which is something I will publish more about next, as part of a working portal for one of the first services coming off the assembly line.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Jul 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/elastic-beam/image.ping.480.medium.png" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>You don’t usually find me writing about API acquisitions unless I have a relationship with the company, or there are other interesting aspects of the acquisition that makes it noteworthy. <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/company/press-releases-folder/2018/ping-identity-acquires-elastic-beam-launches-new-ai-driven-solution-to-secure-apis.html">This acquisition of Elastic Beam by Ping Identity</a> has a little of both for me, as I’ve been working with the Elastic Beam team for over a year now, and I’ve been interested in what Ping Identity is up to because of some research I am doing around open banking in the UK, and the concept of an industry level API identity and access management, as well as API management layer. All of which makes for an interesting enough mix for me to want to quantify here on the blog and load up in my brain, and share with my readers.</p>

<p>From the press release, <em>“Ping Identity, the leader in Identity Defined Security, today announced the acquisition of API cybersecurity provider Elastic Beam and the launch of PingIntelligence for APIs.”</em> Which I think reflects some of the evolution of API security I’ve been seeing in the space, moving being just API management, and also being about security from the outside-in. The newly combined security solution, PingIntelligence for APIs, focuses in on automated API discovery, threat detection &amp; blocking, API deception &amp; honeypot, traffic visibility &amp; reporting, and self-learning–merging the IAM, API management, and API security realms for me, into a single approach to addressing security that is focused on the world of APIs.</p>

<p>While I find this an interesting intersection for the world of APIs in general, where I’m really intrigued by the potential is <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/company/press-releases-folder/2017/open-banking-selects-ping-identity-to-underpin-the-uks-open-bank.html">when it comes to the pioneering open banking API efforts coming out of the UK, and the role Ping Identity has played</a>. “Ping’s IAM solution suite, the Ping Identity Platform, will provide the hub for Open Banking, where all UK banks and financial services organizations, and third-party providers (TPPs) wanting to participate in the open banking ecosystem, will need to go through an enrollment and verification process before becoming trusted identities stored in a central Ping repository.” Which provides an industry level API management blueprint I think is worth tuning into.</p>

<p>Back in March, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/03/01/an-observable-industry-level-directory-of-api-providers-and-consumers/">I wrote about the potential of the identity, access management, API management, and directory for open banking in the UK to be a blueprint for an industry level approach to securing APIs in an observable way</a>. Where all the actors in an API ecosystem have to be registered and accessible in a transparent way through the neutral 3rd party directory, before they can provide or access APIs. In this case it is banking APIs, but the model could apply to any regulated industry, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/03/26/a-regulatory-framework-for-facebook-and-other-platforms-is-already-in-place/">including the world of social media which I wrote about a couple months back as well after the Cambridge Analytics / Facebook shitshow</a>. Bringing API management and security out into the open, making it more observable and accountable, which is the way it should be in my opinion–otherwise we are going to keep seeing the same games being played we’ve seen with high profile breaches like Equifax, and API management lapses like we see at Facebook.</p>

<p>This is why I find the Ping Identity acquisition of ElasticBeam interesting and noteworthy. The acquisition reflect the evolving world of API security, but also has real world applications as part of important models for how we need to be conducting API operations at scale. ElasticBeam is a partner of mine, and I’ve been talking with them and the Ping Identity team since the acquisition. I’ll keep talking with them about their road map, and I’ll keep understanding how they apply to the world of API management and security. I feel the acquisition reflects the movement in API security I’ve been wanting to see for a while, moving us beyond just authentication and API management, looking at API security through an external lens, exploring the potential of machine learning, but also not leaving everything we’ve learned so far behind.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people making money off of the acquisition, organization, and providing access to data in our digital world. While I quietly tune into what the data monetization trends are, I am also actively looking for interesting approaches to generating revenue from data, but specifically with an eye on revenue sharing opportunities for the owners or stewards of that data. You know as opposed to just the exploitation of people’s data, and generating of revenue without them knowing, or including them in the conversation. To help counteract this negative aspect of the data economy, I’m always looking to highlight (potentially) more positive outcomes when it comes to making money from data.</p>

<p>I was recently profiling the API of the <a href="https://www.lotadata.com/">people intelligence platform LotaData</a>, and I came across <a href="https://docs.lotadata.com/monetization.html">their data monetization program</a>, which provides an interesting look at how platforms can help data stewards generate revenue from data, but in a way that makes it accessible to individuals looking to monetize their own data as well. “LotaData’s AI platform transforms raw location signals into ‘People Intelligence’ for monetization, usually based upon the follow key attributes: latitude, longitude, timestamp, deviceID, and accuracy.”</p>

<p>Representing activity at a location and/or point in time, allowing LotaData’s to understand what is happening at specific places at scale, and develop meaningful insights and behavioral segments that other companies and government agencies will want to buy into. Some of the examples they provide are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Commuting daily on CalTrain from Palo Alto to San Francisco</li>
  <li>Mid-week date night at Nopa on the way back from work</li>
  <li>Sweating it out at Soul Cycle on Saturday mornings</li>
  <li>Taking the dog out for a walk on Sunday afternoons</li>
  <li>Season ticket holder for Warriors games at the Oakland Arena</li>
</ul>

<p>LotaData’s location-based insights and segments are entirely inferred from raw location signals, emphasizing that they do not access or collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from mobile phones–stating that they “do not and never will collect PII such as name, email, phone number, date of birth, national identifier, credit cards, or other sensitive information”. Essentially walking on the light side of the whole data acquisition and monetization game, and playing the honest card when it comes to the data economy.</p>

<p>When it comes to the monetization of data, LotaData enables marketers, brands, city governments and enterprise businesses to purchase location-based insights–providing an extensive network of data buyers who are ready to purchase the insights generated from this type of data. Then the revenue generated from the sale of an insight is split proportionately and shared with the app developers who contributed their app data. With the SDK agreement with LotaData governing the payment terms, conditions and schedule for sharing revenue. However, if you are unable to integrated LotaData’s SDK in a mobile app for any reason, they can offer you alternative ways to share and monetize your location data:&lt;p&gt;<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/lotadata/lotadata-ai-big-data-brain-platform.png" width="45%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" />&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Geo-Context API</strong> - The Geo-Context API is a simple script that you can embed in your mobile web sites and web apps. The script collects location data with explicit notice and permission obtained from end users.</li>
  <li><strong>Bulk Data Transfer</strong> - Customers that are proficient in collecting location signals from their mobile apps, websites or other services, can easily upload their historical location archives to LotaData’s cloud for analyzing, inferring and monetizing mobile user segments. The data can be transferred to LotaData by configuring the appropriate access policies for AWS S3 buckets.</li>
  <li><strong>Integration</strong> - LotaData can integrate with CRM and in-house data warehouse systems to ingest custom datasets or usage logs for deep analysis, enrichment and segmentation.
Questions?</li>
</ul>

<p>Providing a pretty compelling model for data providers to monetize their location based data. It is something I’ll be exploring more regarding how individuals can aggregate their own personal or professional data, as well as take advantage of the geo context API, bulk data transfer, or other integration opportunities. I have no idea how much money an individual or company could make from publishing data to LotaData, but the model provides an interesting approach that I think is worth exploring. It would be interesting to run a 30 to 90 test of tracking all of my location data, uploading it to LotaData, and then sharing the revenue details about what I can make with through a single provider like LotaData, as well as explore other potential providers so that you could sell your location data multiple times.</p>

<p>In a world where our data is the new oil, I’m interested in any way that I can help level the playing field, and seeing how we can put more control back into the device owners hands. Allowing mobile phone, wearable, drone, automobile, and other connected device owners to aggregate and monetize their own data in a personal or professional capacity. Helping us all better understand the value of our own bits, and potentially generating some extra cash from its existence. I don’t think any of us are going to get rich doing this, but if we can put a little cash back in our own pockets, and limit the exploitation of our bits by other companies and device manufacturers, it might change the game to be a little more in our favor.</p>
