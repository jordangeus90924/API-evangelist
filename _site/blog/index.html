			<p><em>30 Jul 2021</em></p>
			<p>I try to stay up to speed with what is happening across the leading API specifications each week. The evolution of OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema is important to what I do at Postman, but also to the wider API space. I find it helpful to understand what is happening across each of the API specification communities, and I wanted to also find a way to share what I am seeing with everyone else. Providing a single digest of what is happening, without having to do all the work I am doing each week. While I am sure there is much more going on that I am not tuned into, here is a snapshot of what I see happening. Past Meetings The OpenAPI initiative held its weekly technical developer community (TDC) meeting on Thursday, and you can find the agenda for the session here. In addition to the weekly TDC meeting, there is growing cadence of special interest group (SIG) meetings emerging with the security and travel SIGs both meeting this week. The groups are still getting going and establishing their meeting cadence and agenda. As I gather more links and resources I will make sure and share them. The most I have right now is a link to a pull request to add a SIG page to the OAI specification repository. Mike Ralphson (@permittedsoc), Frank Kilcommins, and I are also holding open office hours across all three specs every Thursday at 8:00 AM PDT, and you are welcome to join in--this update is the result of the work occurring within that meeting. Upcoming Meetings The OpenAPI TDC, Travel SIG, as well as the API specification public office hours will be repeating next week. There will also be an AsyncAPI SIG meeting on August 3rd— you can join in via the calendar or sign up to the mailing list on the home page of the AsyncAPI website. I am pushing to get the OpenAPI SIGs...[<a href="/2021/07/30/api-specifications-update-for-july-30th-2021/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Jul 2021</em></p>
			<p>The API landscape within any enterprise organization is ever changing and evolving, and with APIs being such an abstract and often undocumented aspects of organization work, it can be very difficult to “see” APIs, let alone the forward motion and change of our API infrastructure. As much as we’d love for our teams to properly document all APIs used to power web, mobile, device, and network APIs we depend upon and iterate upon each day, the reality is that APIs regularly possess paths, parameters, schema, and other properties that aren’t always well documented and made “visible” as part of the API development process. This ever expanding shadow landscape of our enterprise API operations is the where the latest waves of startups like Akita Software> are making their mark on the API lifecycle. Akita Software describes itself as an API observability service that helps organizations build API behavior models that expose the reality that exists across our existing API factory floor, then allow teams to produce diffs, merge, and extend definitions of our APIs. I love the type of innovation that Akita Software represents in the API space because they don’t directly see API specifications like OpenAPI in the same light as the rest of us do, they see what exists in the cracks and shadows of the OpenAPIs we produce as part of our regular API operations. Akita Software allows you to watch API traffic from a server, a browser, and via a proxy, and produce OpenAPI maps of the API landscape behind our applications and integrations, producing a more honest view of the ever changing, evolving, and potentially breaking waves of API change under the hood of our companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies. While the end goal in using a service like Akita Software might be about delivering more up to date documentation, or ensuring the coverage of your API testing is more complete, my belief in why their approach matters is because...[<a href="/2021/07/13/seeing-api-change/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Jun 2021</em></p>
			<p>API is a pretty catch all acronym for what is happening across the enterprise these days. I haven’t been writing enough here on the blog to help me separate the layers of the API onion as I work each day, so I wanted to take a crack at doing some storytelling around the different types of APIs I am seeing enterprise organizations work with. An API can be any type of programmatic interface, including language, hardware, or the more web-based, but the biggest defining characteristic of APIs in my experience are how they power business operations, and where in the supply chain they exist. Ultimately, the impact that APIs have on business is very much defined where they live within business operations, and how they work together overall to move a business forward—-here are the dimensions I am thinking about at the moment. Operations ~ This is one area that I find folks have trouble seeing APIs, and realizing that our APIs have APIs. Realizing that Github, Amazon, Jenkins, Kubernetes, and our other pieces of critical infrastructure have APIs isn’t a stretch for many, but applying them to API operations always seems like just out of reach for most teams cognitive load. In my mind, this is where true API governance will come from, and if we are looking to automate more of the API factory floor this is where we should be looking. Microservices ~ Developing simple, do one thing well services are here to stay, even with the complexity they introduce. Enterprise organizations are working to decompose their monolith into many individual services that utilize a variety of different patterns as part of overall operations. Making discovery, traceability, and observability a critical part of operations, as well as having an honest approach to mapping out, understanding, and minimizing dependencies across operations. Partner ~ Even before many enterprise organizations publish any API publicly, they are exposing digital services to their partners, laying the foundation...[<a href="/2021/06/21/different-types-of-api-infrastructure-all-working-in-concert/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am spending time thinking about the big picture of how each of the leading API specifications are operating, and trying to find the best way to communicate the different ways people in the community can get more involved. To help put each of the building blocks used by each of the API specifications front and center I wanted to profile each of the building blocks used by OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema. Helping me better understand the building blocks in use, but then also better understand how I can amplify, cross-pollinate, and drive more participation. When it comes to OpenAPI, these are the three links I would give folks to get introduced to the specification: Website About Blog Next I would recommend you get connected with OpenAPI via their primary social channels to stay in tune with what is going on: Twitter LinkedIn Group Github Org Then when it comes to actually begin learning about the specification and what it does I recommend these channels: Documentation Introduction Getting Started Best Practices Testimonials FAQ Email List Calendar Once you learn about the spec and want to actually get involved in moving the specification forward: Specification Specification Repo Proposals Technical Steering-committee Contribute Registry Then, if you want to go deeper like I have, I recommend diving into the business behind the OpenAPI specification: Charter Members Membership Inquiry Form Membership Join There are also a handful of additional content resources that are worth looking at to understand OpenAPI: Style Guide Presentations Wikipedia Then we can get into the legal details of how it all works if you want to understand this part of specification: Privacy Policy Terms Of-service Trademark Usage Then there are two event related links that are worth noting, providing other ways to get involved in the community" Meetups Conference This provides a nice snapshot of how you can engage with the OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) at almost every level.

			<p><em>21 Jun 2021</em></p>
			<p>I spend a lot of time thinking about API-first design and development, where you craft an OpenAPI definition, mock, document, and iterate upon the design of an API before you develop it. An API-first approach to the design and development of an API comes with a number of benefits for a team and the resulting API, but it is something that there can still be a lot of resistance to when it comes to gaining adoption across an organization. Some teams will be open to learning how to design their APIs using OpenAPI before they ever write any code, but others will resist for a variety of reasons, some founded, and others un-founded. I am always looking for ways that I can improve upon how I talk about API-first, but also how I make it better meet the needs of folks on the ground of API operations. My latest attempt in this area I am calling business-first API-first design and development—-it is a boring name, but it is what I'll start with and hopefully polish over time. Beginning with an API-First Design Approach My approach to API-first has gotten pretty polished through repeated demos with Postman customers and analysts. I have been able to distill down a pretty straightforward approach to designing an API using OpenAPI in a collaborative way down to a handful of steps. Providing with a variety of hands-on API-first examples that exist within public API workspaces, which leverage these API-first design building blocks. Workspace - Designate a specific workspace for each bounded context which an API is being developed, ensuring that all stakeholders are able to find not just the artifacts for each API, but also all of the operations around the API. Ensuring that there is always a dedicated workspace to find everything you need to produce or consume an API. Team - Invite individuals to be part of the team who will have access to the workspace, artifacts, and...[<a href="/2021/06/21/business-first-api-design-and-development/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Apr 2021</em></p>
			<p>Soon after beginning my journey as the API Evangelist in 2010 I began quickly realizing that there was more to this game than just technology. The mission of the blog was to get beyond the technology of APIs, and focus on the business of APIs. Which in 2010 was emerging as the biggest driver of why and how you do APIs, over the actual technical styles, practices, and approaches to delivering API infrastructure. I also quickly realized that it wasn’t just about business, and that there direct and indirect political layers that determine which direction APIs are pushing the tech sector. One critical conversation involving APIs that spans both the business and politics of APIs was the Oracle vs. Google copyright case. I had read about the case back in 2010 and 2011, but I really didn’t understand what it meant until the case got up and running in 2012. Kicking off an almost decade long journey for me as I studied and thought about API copyright, followed the case, then actually begin contributing to the case as part of the EFF’s push to help keep APIs free from copyright, ultimately coming to a conclusion this last week as the Supreme Court returned their decision that APIs were indeed copyrightable, but Google’s use of the Java APIs was indeed fair use. The Oracle vs. Google API copyright case began as two parts, 1) for patent violations, and 2) for copyright infringement involving the Java API. The jury found Google in violation of copyright law for the 11,500 lines of code they reused from the Java API, but acknowledged that it fell under fair use, and then found no fault in the claim of patent violations. However, in the end Judge Alsup declared that fair use didn’t apply because you can’t actually copyright APIs—-which gets at the truth of all of this in my belief. The judge went the extra mile by actually learning Java so...[<a href="/2021/04/13/My-oracle-vs-google-api-copyright-journey/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 Apr 2021</em></p>
			<p>Mike Ralphson (@permittedsoc) suggested that the OAI follow AsyncAPIs lead when it comes to adopting a GraphQL like approach to managing contributions to the specification in the OpenAPI specification technical steering committee (TSC) yesterday. AsyncAPI has followed GraphQL lead as it enters the Linux foundation, and it is something that the OAS TSC is strongly considering. Here are links to the existing contribution guidelines for these three specifications: GraphQL Contribution Guidelines AsyncAPI OpenAPI Admittedly, the OAS “participation” framework is a bit of a special snowflake, which has been mentioned might be one aspect of operations that might be preventing the specification from shifting gears into its next phase of development. To help me learn more about the approach I wanted to break down the GraphQL and AsyncAPI approach. GraphQL - Guiding Principles Backwards compatibility - Once a query is written, it should always mean the same thing and return the same shaped result. Future changes should not change the meaning of existing schema or queries or in any other way cause an existing compliant GraphQL service to become non-compliant for prior versions of the spec. Performance is a feature - GraphQL typically avoids syntax or behaviors that could jeopardize runtime efficiency, or that make demands of GraphQL services which cannot efficiently be fulfilled. Favor no change - As GraphQL is implemented in over a dozen languages under the collaboration of hundreds of individuals, incorporating any change has a high cost. Accordingly, proposed changes must meet a very high bar of added value. The burden of proof is on the contributor to illustrate this value. Enable new capabilities motivated by real use cases - Every change should intend on unlocking a real and reasonable use case. Real examples are always more compelling than theoretical ones, and common scenarios are more compelling than rare ones. RFCs should do more than offer a different way to reach an already achievable outcome. Simplicity and consistency over expressiveness and terseness...[<a href="/2021/04/02/aligning-the-api-specification-contribution-process-across-openapi-asyncapi-and-graphql/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>31 Mar 2021</em></p>
			<p>I am using Postman public workspaces to manage all of my projects right now, and as part of my Postman collection workspace I have a variety of collections where I am bending the concept of how Postman was intended to be used. I was needing many little APIs for my API specification projects to organize a mix of data I will be using to automate and orchestrate information gathering, publishing, and any other task I can automate in my world. After considering using AWS API Gateway + DynamoDB for this, I thought that it would be easier, and more cost effective for me to just use Postman. The platform doesn’t have an API deployment capability, and we do have integrations like with AWS API Gateway, but I really feel like these simple little APIs were even too small for justifying the increase on my AWS bill—I was determined to find a way to do on Postman. I knew I could accomplish what I wanted on Postman, I just needed to think out of the box a little. After some brainstorming I decided to just define each individual data store as a single collection, use the examples as the actual data store, then publish a mock server—-treating the result as more of a “static” API than a mock for testing or other purposes. I ended up with six separate static APIs that are hosted 100% on Postman. Articles (Docs) (Data) - Interesting articles that have been written about Postman Collections. Competition (Docs) (Data) - A list of example of how Postman competitors are using Postman Collections. Government (Docs) (Data) - Showing the different government agencies who are using Postman Collections. Pages (Docs) (Data) - The interesting pages that API Providers have published showcasing their collections. Partners (Docs) (Data) - Demonstrating how Postman partners are importing and exporting Postman Collections.

			<p><em>30 Mar 2021</em></p>
			<p>I am moving my API lifecycle definition into a public workspace so that I can be a little more disciplined in how I version and move forward. It is a pretty lightweight draft at this point because I still have to coordinate internally more about Postman around it, as well as with some partners, but this first version helps me frame the discussions I am having. To help guide the process of defining the API lifecycle I created an OpenAPI to help provide the scaffolding for an API to define the API lifecycle, using Postman mocks and documentation to make things a little more tangible and real.



The creation of the OpenAPI, then generation of the Postman collection and example to help act as the data store for my static API lifecycle API provides me with a nice separation of the structure of how I’d like to talk about the API lifecycle, and the actual data and content that defines the API lifecycle. Using Postman public workspaces as an incubator for defining the API lifecycle in a machine readable and collaborative way. Allowing anyone to discover and play with via the public API workspace, but also allow them to fork and contribute to the work via pull requests, and engage in the feedback loop using Postman comments on the collection or the API—-further separating the conversation around the structure and details of the API lifecycle.[<a href="/2021/03/30/a-workspace-for-defining-the-api-lifecycle/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Mar 2021</em></p>
			<p>Alongside my API lifecycle public workspace I have established an API-first public workspace to help me guide conversations around what is API-first. Like the API lifecycle it is another area we use a lot, but don’t always have a coherent and relatable meaning behind exactly what it means. To get really meta, I am using an API-first process to define the API-first process (mind blown). I am using Postman to define an OpenAPI, which provides me with a structure and schema for how I will be defining API-first, but then I use collection examples to store the API-first definition I am evolving, then I mock and document it to make it a little more tangible, making it all available in a single API workspace.



I am looking to get more precise when I talk about the API lifecycle and API-first. There is no better way to be precise than using an API defined using an API-first process. I learned a lot by setting up the OpenAPI, collections, environment, and mock server for this definition. It pushed me to think a little more deeply about what it is I am trying to define, and pushed me to separate the scaffolding and framework for the definition, from the actual details of the implementation. The API-first workspace provides me with a framework and definition for pushing me forward in this journey, but it also makes it accessible to others to join in via the public workspace, and contribute to the framework via the OpenAPI, or the actual API-first definition using the collection, allowing anyone to fork and submit pull requests, or just leave feedback via the API or collection level comments.[<a href="/2021/03/30/a-workspace-for-defining-apifirst/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am regularly needing to convert CSV files into JSON, and to help me manually get the job done, as well as automate on a schedule or via the Postman API, I created a simple request for pulling a CSV file and converting into a JSON response, and then rendering using the Postman Visualizer.



You can view the documentation for the collection in my file format conversion public workspace. I will be adding other file format conversion requests for this collection as I need them. If you have one you’d like to add feel free to fork the collection and add it yourself! ;-) If you have any feedback, feel free to comment on the collection, or any part of requests.[<a href="/2021/03/29/a-csv-to-json-file-conversion-postman-collection/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I have a lot of little datasets I am organizing for use across a variety of projects. Since Postman has replace Github as my place where I begin all of my API projects, I figured that it could also be used host all of my data projects as APIs. Postman collections often times resemble an OpenAPI definition in that it provides a reference of an API, but in practice collections go much further, allowing you to store example data so that it can be better used in documentation, mocks, testing, and other types of purposes. You can store examples in OpenAPI, but Postman really allows you to go the distance when it comes to actually bringing those examples to life as a documented static API using Postman collections and mock server. An example of this in action can be found with [my Fortune 500 public workspace](https://api-evangelist.postman.co/workspace/Fortune-500~08e01ed9-6906-47a0-a81e-369948912ef4/overview). I needed a list of 2020 Fortune 500 companies so that I can use it a variety of data mining and automation projects. I can easily download the data and publish a proper API, but it is so easy for me to use Postman collection in conjunction with the mock feature to publish simple mock APIs for each of my datasets. Using Postman as a sort of poor mans API hosting, which I won’t be opening up for public use, but will be using across a number of my API Projects. However, just because I won’t be sharing the URLs of my static (mock) APIs, I will be sharing all the collections I have developed around this work, beginning with my collection for generating my static (mock) data API from a CSV. This is just a first version of my collection for pulling any CSV, converting the CSV to JSON, creating a collection, adding the JSON as an example, and then publishing my collection to my public workspace. Next I will be adding an option for adding JSON converted...[<a href="/2021/03/29/a-collection-to-generate-static-apis-using-postman-mock-servers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>From time to time I see folks tweet how they are frustrated with Postman not doing exactly what they want in a particular area of the API lifecycle, letting us know they are moving on to greener pastures. The most common framing for these emotional tweet bursts usually centers around Postman catering to the enterprise and is forgetting our roots when it comes to being their specific reason hey adopted Postman. From my vantage point there are a number of ACTUAL reasons behind why Postman users invoke in these Tweet storms, with “selling to the enterprise” being actually pretty low on the list regarding why they find themselves in the position they are in—let me see if I can break down how I see this recurring theme. Selling to the Enterprise In response to Postman selling to the enterprise—yes we are. We are selling to the enterprise because we are, well….a business, and a venture backed business. The majority of our “developers”, “customer”, and “users” operate within the enterprise, so we are listening to what they need and providing a platform for them to be more successful. Sure, we are motivated by revenue, but this doesn’t mean we aren’t motivated by feedback from our users as well. Selling to the enterprise is a reality for any startup who is building software, and it really shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone, or really be much of a talking point when it comes to critique of any API service provider. I would ask a few things of anyone taking this position. Who do you sell to? - Do you plan on not selling to the enterprise as part of the business you are building, and tif you do, are you going to weight responses from developers who are not affiliated with an enterprise organization, over those who are? Always have a Plan B, C, and D - You should plan that EVERY platform you depend on will...[<a href="/2021/03/28/targeting-the-enterprise-and-ignoring-developer-s-needs-around-a-specific-stop-along-the-api-lifecycle/">Read More</a>]</p>

However, this time I am determined to ground myself in a vocabulary and set of visualizations that ground me an my storytelling around the API lifecycle, helping me be more coherent and precise when I talk about delivering APIs. Over the last decade I have worked to define what I would consider over a hundred stops along a lifecycle, but in 2021 I am looking to distill that down into the most meaningful, impactful, and wide reaching approach to describing what the API lifecycle is. To help me stabilizing my storytelling I’ve established this baseline API lifecycle definition. Publisher Lifecycle The first part of the API lifecycle definition is all about the publisher, something I have historically called deployment, but I think publisher provides a cleaner representation of what is happening-defined in a way that makes it inclusive to non-developers, helping make the API lifecycle more accessible to business groups. Design - A diverse API toolbox and full lifecycle approach to API design. Mock - Utilizing a mock representation of a service to drive an API-first approacht to brginning the lifecycle. Document - Ensuring there is always up to date, meaningful, and living documentation present for APIs. Test - Providing 100% test coverage for APIs when it comes to contract, integration, performance, and security.

I am meeting regularly with the Solace team to define the API lifecycle across a request and response, as well as an event-driven world. As part of our discussions Jonathan Schabowsky (@jschabowsky) shared his earlier vision of how he sees the event-driven API lifecycle which I though was worth documenting and including the visualization as part of my wider research. Jonathan breaks things down into four main areas or top level groups of the stops along his event-driven API lifecycle, but I think his outline provides a pretty interesting look at the API lifecycle from the view of an event-driven API service providers. Discover Event Streams: Search and locate events which are of interest Relationships: Understand the relationship between events, their sources and who is consuming them Define Use Case: Determine desired business outcome Schema: Create business objects that represent the event context Event: Construct event metadata including addressing (topic) and headers Specify Application: link events as inputs and outputs to the business logic Develop Generate code: Use code generators to create application “scaffolding” based on the application specification Add business logic: Create application which performs the required function Operate Secure: Enforce authentication and authorization policies Deploy: Start and connect to the runtime event broker Audit: Determine if there are any runtime vs. design time violations Monitor: Understand the utilization of events, schemas and applications based on historical and real-time metrics Improve: Enhance applications, events and schemas; deprecate events that aren’t being utilized Anytime I look at someone else’s definition of the API lifecycle I immediately see things that are missing, but then I always check myself knowing that my bias is always towards my perspective and view of the API lifecycle at the 500K...[<a href="/2021/03/24/an-eventdriven-view-of-the-api-lifecycle/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>It is hard to have a discussion about things we can’t see. Some of us excel at dealing in the abstract, but most people prefer discussion involving more visual and tangible things. One of the critical aspects of the world of APIs I am hell bent on trying to visualize lately is the API lifecycle. This is one of this ubiquitous phrases you hear perpetually in the space (me included), but is something that means something different depending on who you talk to, and there just aren’t many very meaningful or quality visual representations of what the API lifecycle is. As I gather up examples of how different API service and tooling providers work to visualize the API lifecycle I am going to share then here on the blog, with this one from digitalml being pretty interesting. There are several things I really like about digitalml's approach to visualizing the API lifecycle. First it is people centered! Next I really like the pulley system showing the conplexity and multiple flows of the API lifecycle--I am always frustrated when the API lifecycle is a single linear direction. There are some things I don't like, mainly that it misses much of the sustainment portion of this conversation, and is just one slice of the API lifecycle from a single vendors view. But this is the game right? I can't fault them for sharing their slice of the pie--I do it all the time. Overall, it is a pretty slick looking visualization of the lifecycle that I think with some refinements could provide a pretty meaningful way to help paint a dynamic picture of what the API lifecycle actually is and does. I am working really hard to lock down a single vocabulary for describing the API lifecycle. I am also very, very, very interested in coming up with a set of visual representations to go along with this vocabulary.

			<p>I have seen a lot of API service providers come and go over the last decade, and I always appreciate when simple, useful, and purpose built API solutions emerge. I can use up most of my fingers counting the number of innovative API startups to emerge in the last couple of years, which is something that really makes me happy. One of the API startups that caught my attention lately, and I recently had the pleasure of connecting with, was Bump. I usually like to formulate my own words for describing what an API startup does, but I think that Bump’s description does it more justice than I could. Bump is the first API contract management platform that helps document and track APIs: we intelligently identify changes in the APIs structure, and keep developers up to date. This isn’t just an API documentation solution. This is an API change management solution that realizes that documentation is the face of change within most organizations. Bump is an elegant, beautiful, and purposeful API change management solution built on the foundation of OpenAPI and AsyncAPI, helping ensure that your API documentation is future proof. It isn’t future proof just because of the of the built-in change management. It is future because it realizes that a diverse API toolbox is required to get us into the future, and that OpenAPI and AsyncAPI are how you will manage the evolution of API operations into this future. Ensuring that the surface area of your HTTP, TCP, MQTT, AMQP, Kafkam and other APIs are all working in concert, and are machine readable by default, but also human readable in a way that allows developers to always keep up with what is going on. Bump represents the latest wave of API service providers who are refining upon the existing building blocks of doing APIs, but also work to more seamlessly weave these building blocks into our existing software development lifecycle using Git and...[<a href="/2021/03/22/managing-api-change-discovery-and-documentation-using-bump/">Read More</a>]</p>

Yes! That is how I see Postman. GitHub changed my relationship with code in many ways. Github plays a significant role in how I produce, manage, and evolve the code that I produce for my own side projects and businesses, as well as the code I engage with as part of my job and the projects I work on. This blog post is my mental exercise of thinking through what GitHub has given me when it comes to code, which in my world translates pretty nicely to what I do with APIs.

			<p>I sat down with Eric Sheridan (@eric_sheridan) of WhiteHat Security this week to talk about API security. I have been working with Eric as a partner of Postman for a number of months now, and I find their approach to security, plus the open source software and Postman collections they are building very thought provoking, so I wanted to begin recording some of our discussions. We were coming together to talk about their API security testing collectiona>, but then ended up talking about the big picture of API security and how it fits into API governance. WhiteHat Security has API security solution you can run using Docker combined with a Postman collection to scan any API you have defined using a Postman collection, adding the much needed API security scanning to the API lifecycle. Eric and I started our session intending to walk through their API security collection, and while we did that, something I had said in a previous conversation around API governance had stuck in Eric’s brain, so we worked through the concept of API governance blueprint that would include security scanning, something that their Postman collection would help deliver—-resulting in almost an hour long conversation about the role of API security in the API lifecycle and resulting governance. The WhiteHat Security API testing collection already provides extremely rich feedback on the state of security with any API you have defined as a Postman collection, but we began brainstorming how this could also include machine readable output that could be used as part of a wider API governance observability strategy. Every run of a Postman collection produces an output which can be aggregated, indexed, and made available alongside other testing, performance, and operational characteristics. The goal, as discussed in the video would be a machine readable blueprint for API governance which includes security, which can then be implemented and reported upon in an automated way.

I recently asked a simple question. What is your API lifecycle? This is one of the ubiquitous phrases that we use in the API space that has no concrete definition and means many different things to many different people. I was sitting on a call listening to a conversation, and figured I'd tweet and ask folks what their perspective was. What is your API lifecycle?

It isn't just about a linear set of stops along a lifecycle, and more about a healthy loop you can use to bring APIs to life. /* w/ repeating interations *//* exit-any b4 deploy *//* YMMV */do { explore, select, model, design, describe, sketch, prototype, build, document, test, secure, deploy} until { freeze, redirect, deprecate, donate}#API360&mdash; Mike Amundsen (@mamund) February 25, 2021 Then Mike v2.0 chimes in with his honest and precise view of the landscape and how all of this truly works, introducing one of the most important stops along a modern API lifecycle--regret.

			<p>I have been evolving my approach to API governance with Postman since I started working there 1.5 years ago, but recently I am finding more time to invest in how I am “testing” the surface area of an API using it’s OpenAPI, and rolling I tall up in a public workspace I am simply calling governance. It is a slightly different approach then what you see with other JSON Schema centered approaches, which is something I am evolving side by side, but for this workspace of API governance collections I was going for a more free form, scripted based approach, where I may or may not use a JSON Schema to validate. To help me prepare for my upcoming conversations I wanted to record a walkthrough of my API governance workspace as it stands today. I am just getting started with this work. The scripts I have are still pretty hacky, and need a lot of work, but it provides me with a set of API governance collections that anyone can implement, but then also evolve to meet their own needs. I am purposefully publishing these API governance “tests” or “questions” as a suite of different collections, with each question as an individual request. I am counting on them being a very modular buffet of what is possible with API governance. Ideally these just help jumpstart the imagination of developers who have better JavaScript skills than I do, so I can just start forking and working with others API governance collection, but until that happens I’ll make do with my tacky versions. ;-) They get the job done and demonstrate what is possible. I am just looking to showcase how you can use existing Postman testing capabilities for API governance with this public workspace. I am hoping that the use of existing Postman capabilities for testing, and the ability to script API governance tests in JavaScript will make the approach more familiar to developers.

			<p>I love it when someone realizes that APIs have APIs during one of my talks or reading of of my stories. I find that people are so heads down in their daily jobs they don’t have much time to sit back and contemplate the bigger picture, which is something that might lead them to see APIs behind their API infrastructure, but also consider how it fits into the overall API lifecycle. Since 2014 I have been on a journey to produce a machine readable artifact from every stop along the API lifecycle, and the “API deployment” is one of the stops I’ve been very keen to lock down with a set of API-driven deployment blueprints that would help define, standardize, automate, and allow us to measure the deployment of our APIs. I am looking to turn APIs.json / APIs.yaml into a machine readable blueprint for API operations, and to be able to do that I need the API deployment process to be more defined and observable—something I am going to do with APIs. API deployment is one of the toughest stops along the lifecycle to nail down because there are so many different ways in which an API an be deployed. Pick your programming language, framework, platform, gateway, service, or open source tooling, and get the job done. It is something that doesn’t always lend itself to defining and standardizing because the landscape is so define by vendor pressure and developer dogma, but I am determined to bring some order to how I define and deploy APIs using a variety of common approaches. The first API deployment blueprint I’d like to share is my collection for deploying a simple API to AWS API Gateway backed by DynamoDB—-here is a walkthrough of how the API deployment blueprint collection works. This is a very simple approach to API deployment. The blueprint won’t handle very complex schema, and there is no layer for business logic.

			<p>The work with our open data partners over at Metadata Technology North America (MTNA) continues, moving from our last post on CMS healthcare data to working with a variety of environmental datasets. I have a couple of open data projects going on right now, and as we find ourselves with a new administration in the United States, as well as getting closer to Earth Day 2021, we figured it would be a good time to help make data that is available as downloadable files more searchable and usable via a more modern web API. I had given the MTNA team ten links to a mix of environmental data sets last week, and this week they came back to me with the next steps for deploying each one as a more accessible API, something we cover in the video of our regular open data discussions. I had given MTNA a mixed bag of data and APIs, but I was really interested to see how they could help with three of the larger datasets, which were proving a little bit unwieldy when it came to publishing as a simple static API using Postman — here are the three I was most interested in: CO2 Time Series 1970-2018 Global Wildfires from 2013-2016 Citizens considering climate change as serious problem per country Next, they’ll be publishing each of these as an API using their Rich Data Services (RDS), and I’ll get to work publishing an OpenAPI and collection in a public workspace, or set of public workspaces. I like to keep datasets separated and then just share them to the workspaces I am needing to work with them. Once I get my hands on the APIs for these we will do another session on documenting them using Postman, publishing them to a public workspace so that others can fork, but then also put together an access plan for helping MTNA manage access to the data.

			<p><em>08 Mar 2021</em></p>
			<p>I am working with our open data partners over at Metadata Technology North America (MTNA) to publish a mix of open data APIs across a variety of areas. First up on the list are the providers. We are working to better understand how APIs are being used in healthcare, and to help us in our journey we are taking the data files on characteristics of hospitals and other types of healthcare facilities, including the name and address of the facility and the type of Medicare services the facility providers, and looking to make available via a first class API. There are data files outlining all of the CMS service providers for just shy of the last 20 years, making for a pretty rich data set that would be very useful as a modern API, so Pascal over at MTNA got to work breaking things down, something he covers in great detail via this video from our session.



We are unsure exactly where all of this work will end up. First we are looking to better understand the state of CMS data, but also use it to help us understand how their recent CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization Proposed Rule is playing out in the market. We aren’t healthcare experts, but MTNA are data experts, and I know my way around the API space, so we are just looking to map things out from a data and API specification perspective. Next, once Pascal and team publish a production version of the CMS service provider directory, I will take it and produce an OpenAPI and Postman collection within a public workspace, helping make the CMS service provider directory API more accessible, and something we can iterate upon via the public workspace as we do some more storytelling.

			<p><em>08 Mar 2021</em></p>
			<p>I did a marathon series of open data and specification sessions with our partners over at Metadata Technology North America (MTNA) last week, which during one of them I learned about Ariā, where you can find and download concepts and definitions, classifications, concordances, and standards used for data and statistical activities across New Zealand government. MTNA has put years of work into the platform, which is something they are now also rolling out for Stats Canada. I have had several discussions with MTNA about Ariā, but this working session was my first deep dive into the platform, and the API that power it. Here is our over 60 minute session where the MTNA team provides a comprehensive look at the power behind not just Ariā, but the entire standards and classification platform. I am still getting up to speed on everything Ariā does. Next I will spend some time playing with the API. This is where I will be able to better understand how it all works. I am keen on trying to help document it, but then also think about the overall developer experience that could be stood up around not just individual implementations of the Ariā API, but for an overall global instance of it. As I discuss in the working sessions, it is really a fundamental part of the overall open data conversation, by providing all the essential building blocks all of us API developers are needing to round off our API operations. As developers, we really spend way too much time reinventing the wheel when it comes to the most commonly used standards and classifications which should be readily available via a simple but robust API so that it can be used in all types of applications. If you’d like to learn more about Ariā I recommend watching the video, but you can also stay tuned for more working sessions, and storytelling around Ariā. If you have more questions I recommend...[<a href="/2021/03/08/learning-about-commonly-used-standards-and-classifications-api-with-aria-from-stats-new-zealand/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>The secret to Amazon’s success is by far the number one story I have ever written on my blog. It was written nine years ago and still out performs other posts. It is also more fiction than most of the other stories you will find on API Evangelist. It truly represents the API economy for me, and I am guessing for entirely different reasons it also represents the API economy for others who read it. While the Amazon story is compelling from a general business view, I feel that Amazon’s API story is really key to understanding where the future value of all of this lies. I think that doubling down on the Amazon myth story is really where the next explosion of growth will be when it comes to the tech sector, and it will help us see beyond the digital commodification of individual resources and capabilities as Amazon has done with storage, compute, dns, and other essential building blocks of the online world. To help me understand what might be next for the tech sector, I try to understand the logic behind Amazon doubling down on the further commodification of digital resources and other capabilities like we’ve see them do with storage, compute, database, and dns, but also the further commodification refinement as you see them doing with “serverless” compute and now “serverless” database. Amazon led the charge when it came to the commodification of of essential digital resources using APIs, and they have the numbers on how this all works, allowing them to further squeeze incremental revenue out of these existing digital commodities moving forward. However, Amazon’s commodification tactics have become more of a negative in recent years with their targeting of resources that are central to some of their customers as Amazon crosses over into healthcare, banking, and other areas outside of the realm of compute, looking to dominate in the next generation of digital products and services using APIs.

			<p><em>04 Mar 2021</em></p>
			<p>Jean Yang from Akita Software pinged some of us in the API community with "People don't like specs. There's a long history of people not liking specs." @thatplguy on how we need a new term for [PLACEHOLDER WORD] that we infer from behavior, since people think specs are things that take work to write and get out of date.” I wanted to riff off all the great ideas from folks who replied, and see where I could go with the concept. I am fine with the term specification, but as a storyteller I get the power and potential of finding exactly the right word to describe this. I also get that people don’t like doing things that sound like work, and if we can come up with a term or phrase that softens things up, making it friendlier and more accessible, while retaining all of the essence of what API specifications, I think it could move the needle on API spec literacy and practice amongst the masses of people waking up to APIs in 2021. I see singer and songwriter Matt McLarty (@MattMcLartyBC) suggest models in response to Jean—here are my thoughts piled on Matt’s: Models - I like this one. I agree that we are modeling all the moving parts of our operations. Working together to model all of our API capabilities makes a lot of sense. I would say it begins to break down though as a concept as we move into production. The closest definition of model to this situation is, “a system or thing used as an example to follow or imitate.” Is it sufficient enough to take us through the entire lifecycle? IDK... Then I see Harry Potter, er I mean my friend Michael Hibay (@hibaymj) suggest languages and vocabularies, to which I pile on my own thoughts: Languages - I worry this is too ambiguous and will get lost in the shuffle--not translate globally.

			<p><em>03 Mar 2021</em></p>
			<p>I am working with the OpenAPI for the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), getting more familiar with the specification as I get strengthen my awareness of the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule. I have the OpenAPI for the FHIR specification published to a public API workspace, and a collection I generated from it to help me document, mock, and apply contract tests for FHRI APIs, helping ensure they are compliant to the healthcare API standard. As soon as I ran my first request against a sandbox FHIR API I was provided with two alerts letting me know the response was out of sync with the actual spec.



These are pretty simple, yet critical structural issues in the way the OpenAPI is defined that doesn’t actually match the API implementation. I am still unsure if it is the OpenAPI that is wrong, or the sandbox API implementation, so I am just going to leave a comment on the individual API method in the OpenAPI, letting me revisit later and resolve each issue once I have the answer.



I am going to play with more of the API before I submit the issue with the FHIR working group, or at least who is in charge of the OpenAPI for the FHIR specification. I am looking to create a suite of validation collections for the API specification that can be run manually, scheduled and run regularly, or triggered as part of a CI/CD pipeline, so I need to make sure the OpenAPI and derivative collections are correct before I publish them, making them available to Postman healthcare customers who are looking to validate their APIs. Ensuring that healthcare APIs are following the FHIR specification down to the detail will be critical to achieve the interoperability the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule is looking to accomplish.

			<p><em>03 Mar 2021</em></p>
			<p>I pushing forward the documenting and certifying of UK public APIs in a public workspace. Historically I only had a single OpenAPI definition for each of the six public banking APIs, but as part of pushing forward my work I wanted to have multiple versions for each of the APIs. The UK government mandates that all banks have each of the six public APIs following a common definition, which provides the perfect set of APIs to demonstrate the possibilities of applying common industry API standards. However, to show the power of public API workspaces I needed to be able to show the change that occurs across each of the APIs being maintained over time. This image shows four separate versions for the ATM locator API. I chose to only do version 2.0 of the API for now, and maybe once I have a little more bandwidth I will be able publish the older versions as well. Once I prove out some of the concepts I want to push forward I am looking to tell the change narrative that exists across each of the APIs since they were born. Before I move to far with my work I need to validate and certify each of the fifteen banks I have environments published for, helping me certify each bank’s API to the core OpenAPI specification. I downloaded the Swagger 2.0 files from the Open Banking UK wiki, but then chose to upgrade them to OpenAPI 3.0 before I imported into Postman. The work I am doing involves using the OpenAPI 3.0 components object and some other capabilities that do not exist in 2.0 of the specification. Ideally, the official working group managing the specification would migrate to the current version of the spec, but I’ll address that as I work with them to help me take over the public workspace for the UK public banking APIs.

			<p><em>17 Feb 2021</em></p>
			<p>I am pushing forward how Postman can be used for public data. I have a whole mess of different data sets I need available for different projects I am working on. For one project I am aggregating ten separate environmental data sources available as a mix of CSV, JSON, and excel files, as well as a couple of actual APIs. I am looking to build an embeddable dashboard widget using data across these ten sources, and I am looking to organize all of them via a single public workspace, helping normalize them all as simple APIs returning CSV or JSON. The project is just a POC, and once it moves toward production we’ll launch actual APIs, but for now I am able to mock them using Postman. The process got me thinking about how this approach can be used to make simple public datasets available via forkable Postman collections. Simple Data APIs Using Collections As I began aggregating the datasets into Postman, the first couple of datasets were pretty basic. Simple CSV or JSON files, and a couple basic APIs. I just created a collection, added a new request, and pasted the URL into the request and pulled the data from the source. Once I had the response from each API I would save the response as an example for the request. Then the entire CSV or JSON would be stored locally within the collection. For most of them I’d convert the data to, or from JSON or CSV, and add a parameter property so that each response could returned depending on what format the consumer desires for the visualizations. Now that I have an example stored for each dataset as part of the collection I can mock the collection, making the data available as a simple “mocked” API. This approach provides a public or private URL I can share with anyone who is building a prototype application-—in this case a widget.

			<p>I am working to load up all my API discovery experiences into my head for some upcoming conversations. So I sat down and pulled together a summary of my API discovery research to date to help refresh my memory of what has happened and how we got here. API discovery is the one of the few layers of the API space that I am personally committed to helping move things forward and being able to see all the moving parts together helps me keep doing this. Let’s take a stroll through my memory of the evolution of API discover over the last fifteen years so that I can speak more coherently about all of this with a variety of folks. ProgrammableWeb ProgrammableWeb was the first source of being able to discover API, and in 2020 it is still the place you go to find APIs. Really not much has changed in the last fifteen years with ProgrammableWeb except for the owners and operators, and the look and feel of the site. It is still where you go to look for new and existing APIs, and where you find APIs when Googling. I have fond memories of writing for ProgrammableWeb, and the site is still a great source of information for me, but I am left frustrated that PW hasn’t moved forward the API discovery conversation in any interesting ways over the years. I just think it is a missed opportunity, and reflects much about the API space that I think holds us all back. Mashape -> Rapid API After ProgrammableWeb, the next evolution in the API space when it came to API discovery was Mashape, which is now known as Rapid API. The API marketplace was born out of the age of API management and provides basic management capabilities alongside with API discovery services. Providing a pretty rich set of APIs you can search and onboard with using the Rapid API marketplace.

			<p>If you have followed my work you know that I like telling stories. Stories are the single most important tool in my Chief Evangelist and API Evangelist toolbox. None of the code matters in my opinion, and the stories surrounding the code is what makes the actual impact on our reality. The stories we tell each other, as well as the stories we tell ourselves. Everything in the world of technology and APIs is made up of stories. I am hovering around 5000 stories here on API Evangelist, which reflects everything I am when it comes to API Evangelist. Stories are how I make sense of the API world that has unfolded in the last twenty years. Storytelling is how I work through all of the things I do not understand, moving everything API from a very abstract realm into something that is more tangible, visible, and sometimes more meaningful to me in the real world. I couldn’t have done any of this without stories. Throughout my storytelling as the API Evangelist I have also taught myself to work through my own personal baggage over at kinlane.com. Applying the same methodology to my past and figuring out who I am today. API Evangelist has always been very much a performance, but the storytelling I engaged in as part of the performance went much deeper than being just a business production. Over the years, both of these streams of storytelling (apievangelist.com & kinlane.com) have influenced others in the world, having an impact on their storytelling, or help them embark on their own storytelling journey. I’ve learned a lot from these engagements, and made a lot of friends around the world because of a shared love for storytelling.

			<p>I have to admit something. I don&rsquo;t fully grasp the entire landscape of API testing. I mean, I have a pretty decent awareness and experience in testing APIs, but I can&rsquo;t close my eyes and coherently break down each layer or type of testing, let alone competently navigate the many different types of services and tooling available on the market for API testing. Like most other dimensions of the API universe the content and guidance on the subject of API testing is all over the place. After a couple of hours Googling and making my way through my bookmarks, I uncovered a pretty expansive dictionary for what I&rsquo;d consider to be under the umbrella of API testing. First off, I have to talk about API testing in the most general sense before I get into the more and less formal API testing approaches. It was a dimension of API testing I hadn&rsquo;t considered before I began working at Postman, but API testing meaning that I am just kicking the tires on a API, learning what it is all about, and how you use it. This is what the majority of Postman&rsquo;s 13 million users are doing when they say they are testing an API with the Postman platform. THis experimental and curious approach to API testing provides a great onramp to the world of API publishing and consumption, but does little to help us articulate what API testing is or isn&rsquo;t. Beyond just &ldquo;testing out&rdquo; an API, from what I can gather across about 25 separate API testing articles, there are 25 different layers to the API testing onion: Validation Testing - I am guessing a general type of validation &mdash; seems pretty broad. Functional Testing - Adopted as part of code testing practices, applied to unit of code. Component Testing - Similar to functional, but testing based upon small unit of compute.

			<p>I love the word entropy. It means so many things to so many different people. In means different things in the physical realm versus the informational or virtual realms. It is one of those big words you can say to confuse people, or actually get yourself in trouble being able to actually defend your position on what entropy means when around smart people. It is said that famed mathematician John Von Neumann had told fellow mathematician and creator of Information Theory that he should use the word entropy instead of information because that no one understands entropy and then you can win arguments about your theory. I also read that Shannon and Norbert Weiner also dueled over the meaning, seeing it in very opposite ways. I like the word for all of these reasons, but mostly because of its relationship to uncertainty.&nbsp; In the realm of physics entropy means, a thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of disorder or randomness in the system In the more virtual realm of information theory, the entropy of a random variable is the average level of information, surprise, or uncertainty inherent in the variable's possible outcomes. While I could easily use entropy as a metaphor for APIs in the physical sense, it is really the appropriation of it for information theory that really brings it home for me. Entropy in Shannon&rsquo;s time was centered around noise or static in communication, but when you look at how APIs enable communication between systems, and allowing web, mobile, device, and network applications to communicate, this static or noise reveals itself as friction, errors, outages, instability, unreliability, and misaligned business and political priorities.&nbsp; &nbsp;Think about the level of information one encounters when it comes to putting APIs to work these days. Consider the surprise one encounters when seemingly similar API resources speak entirely different dialects or behave inconsistently.

			<p><em>29 Jan 2021</em></p>
			<p>I am preparing for the next version of APIs.json and I am taking another pass over what the specification is, but also taking a fresh look at why the specification exists. Part of this fresh look involves assessing what I consider to be the low bar for an APIs.json index, as well as what the entire scope might look like. To help me (and you) understand the scope of what APIs.json or APIs.yaml can do when it comes to indexing our API operations and making them discoverable in a machine readable way. The most important thing to remember about APIs.json is that it is all about indexing API operations in a way that acknowledges that there are two sides of this API integration game which need to be indexed and made discoverable across an organization. Human Readable - Providing URL references for the aspects of API Operations that human stakeholders will need to understand what is happening with APIs and how to put them to work in applications. Machine Readable - Providing URL references for aspects of API Operations that are system and applications can use to make sense of API Operations, accessing as a machine readable definition. APIs.json is about indexing all of these human and machine readable aspects of our API Operations with an emphasis on evolving human readable elements to also be machine readable so that as much of the surface area of our API operations is indexable by other systems and applications as possible. There is another dimension of APIs.json as a specification that is helpful to understand beyond the human and machine readable elements, by providing a vocabulary for describing two separate scopes of API operations, helping define the scope of information provided. API Specific Properties - References to details about a specific API, providing human and machine readable details about an API, so that consumers understand everything that is possible. Common Properties - References to details that support all...[<a href="/2021/01/29/examples-of-minimum-viable-and-complete-landscape-apis-json-index-files/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am giving some much needed love to my APIs.yaml and API.json API discovery format while using the work to also just think about the wider API landscape. This is the original intent behind APIs.json&hellip;to help me make sense of the API landscape.&nbsp; Most folks are thinking about APIs as a producer, or as a consumer&mdash;hopefully both. However, there are fewer people who also pay attention to the entire API landscape, and APIs.json emerged out of this need for me in 2014. In 2020 I find myself totally immersed in the API landscape as part of my API Specification Toolbox project which grew out of Postman becoming a member of the OpenAPI Initiative, and I wanted toht spend why Saturday afternoon (I know I have a problem) thinking about the API landscape at the 250K.&nbsp; APIs.json API Property Types Using APIs.json or APIs.yaml you can define the properties of one or many APIs for a variety of purposes. Each API you describe can have an array of properties which can be common human readable elements like documentation or sign up, as well as machine readable properties like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, or JSON Schema. APIs.json property types are intentionally human or machine readable with the intent on evolving every human readable element to have a machine readable element&mdash;think the relationship between documentation (Human) and OpenAPI (Machine) when understand the objective. I have several thousand API Providers and API service providers in my API Evangelist database. I track on the properties of all of these companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies that I come across. When I group the property types across the thousands of APIs I have indexed, I end up with this default set of building blocks for API providers, grouped by different areas of the API lifecycle. Onboarding These are the properties of any API operation that help consumers, or any other party onboard with the concept of an API, begin using the API, as...[<a href="/2021/01/23/evaluating-apis-json-api-property-types-alongside-openapi-extensions/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>The word &ldquo;open&rdquo; gets thrown around so much in the API space I find myself needing to regularly ground myself in what it actually means. It gets thrown around in so many different ways that I find eventually I start to believe the bullshit and regularly have to pause and recalibrate. It is one of those words that has been captured and used by people looking to manipulate the space so often it often means the exact opposite of what we all think it means, but it is also such an important word that I think we have to fight to keep it in our vocabulary. I feel like I am perpetually fighting with some invisible force over one of the front doors to the house we all live in, and I am determined for the door to not get completely shut, and I have to make sure the door actually ends up go where someone expects when they do open the door. Let&rsquo;s begin by actually taking inventory regarding the many different ways people use the word &ldquo;open&rdquo; to describe the world of APIs. Gathering all the ways it gets wielded in service of publishing and consuming APIs. Some of the ways in which it gets wielded are good, and some of them are bad. At this point I am just looking to be able to see the spectrum of use, and I am not looking to entirely pass judgement on anyone who uses it in specific ways. Here is the laundry list of ways &ldquo;open&rdquo; is wielded that impact the landscape I pay attention to on a daily basis, and have been helping shape for the last decade.&nbsp; &nbsp;Publicly Available - Open means something is available to anyone in the public, allowing them to use an API, and any resources around them. &nbsp;Access - An API or supporting resource is open for access by the public or the developer community in general, making...[<a href="/2021/01/11/what-does-open-mean-in-the-world-of-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>It has been a while since I looked at the 250K view of what is going on with APIs across federal government agencies in the United States. Since working for the Obama administration in 2013 I am perpetually on a quest to map out what is happening across federal agencies, helping drive the conversation forward. I belieive APIs can make the most impact when our federal government helps lead the way, and I am looking to help push things forward in the following ways. Keep mapping out the Federal Government API Landscape - I am determined to produce a map of the APIs that exist across federal agencies and keep the list alive and active. Establish Public API Workspaces for Federal Agencies - I am looking to establish public API workspaces for agencies who are implementing APIs--helping do some work from the outside-in. Refresh My Memory of What is Happening - I thrive on knowing what is going on across federal agencies, and doing these reviews pushes me to refresh my awarenss of APIs at this level. Fire Up new Conversations - These sotries always rise up in the SEO game and bring in new conversations with folks who are doing interesting things with APIs in government. I always learn a lot looking through the different government agencies. I learn even more wading through the different datasets, databases, and various incarnations of APIs. There is way too much work here than one person can handle, and much of what I come across labeled as an API really isn't an API, but could be with a little work. While doing these roundups I always reach a point where I feel like I am not doing enough, but ultimately I have to strike a balance between being comprehensive and just scratching the surface.

			<p><em>19 Dec 2020</em></p>
			<p>I have struggled to properly articulate to partners the potential of publishing API collections to the Postman API network, as well as via public workspaces. Most folks I talk to see Postman collections similar to how they see an OpenAPI&mdash;a reference of every path available via an API. While Postman collections excel at being in the service of publishing reference documentation, or used as an interactive API client, they can be much more.&nbsp; I am seeing a natural progression in the types of collections API providers are&nbsp; publishing, which results in a robust mix of collections that describe everything that is possible with an API, but also what capabilities an API platform provides, as well as workflow collections that accomplish specific business tasks.&nbsp;To help me demonstrate the different types of Postman collections I wanted to take the JIRA Cloud Platform API and publish a variety of collections to a public workspace&mdash;helping make the concept more relative to people across the enterprise landscape. Reference API Collections Most API Providers begin with publishing what is a reference API collection, providing a full menu of what is possible across the entire surface area of an API. This is where collections most reflect OpenAPI by providing an entire machine readable menu of what an API delivers so that it can be used to publish documentation. While some API Providers hand craft Postman collections for their entire menu of APIs in this way I recommend defining the surface area of your API using OpenAPI ,then generate a collection from the OpenAPI truth&mdash;something Postman will help you do, and then keep in sync with the OpenAPI source. For this story, I have downloaded Atlassian Jira&rsquo;s OpenAPI, imported into Postman, and selected the option to automatically generate a collection for the purposes of documentation.&nbsp;You can view all of this via the public workspace I have setup, or you can run in your Postman using the button below.

			<p>Sometimes I need to do bulk updates to Postman collections and there is no better way to automate this than to use a Postman Collection that uses the Postman API&mdash;inception level stuff, so be careful ;-). I have setup a dedicated public workspace where I am building out these utility type operational level collections&nbsp;that help me manage the API lifecycle out ahead of what the Postman GUI is capable of doing. Some of the things I am doing will eventually make its way to the Postman UI, but some of them will not. Either way, I am too impatient to wait, and one of the things I love about Postman is that I can hack my way forward through just about any situation using the Postman API. Building on my base collection for pulling and updating collections, I added two differents requests that will help me capitalize the first letter of each word in a folder or request name of a collection. Apply Title Case to All Folder Names in a Collection Apply Title Case to All Request Names in a Collection To run, all you have to do is make sure you&rsquo;ve entered a collection ID (pulled from URL or info tab), and hit run&mdash;it will loop through each folder and request and capitalize the words, and then save the collection using the Postman API. So you can immediately put to use the same collection with the changes you desired. If you have any questions on the collection for pulling a collection and making changes using the Postman API, feel free to submit a comment for the collection as part of the collection workspace. I&rsquo;ll be centralizing the evolution of this collection, as well as other collection related collections within this workspace.

			<p><em>12 Dec 2020</em></p>
			<p>The Federal Trade Commission is sueing Facebook, alleging that they are illegally maintaining a monopoly on the personal social network space using a continued series of anticompetitive behavior. The suit includes a coalition of attorneys general of 46 states, bringing the latest wave of regulatory scrutiny into the social media platform, highlighting three main dimensions of how Facebook has engaged in a systematic strategy of anticompetitive practices that has resulted in their current dominant position online. Instagram - Facebook purchased Instagram to remove what they saw as one of the biggest threats they faced, while also purchasing market dominance in the image and photos sharing space. WhatsApp - Fsacebook purchased WhatsApp to remove what they saw as one of the biggest threats they faced, while also purchasing market dominance in the messaging space. API - Facebook used their API to cut off access to applications they saw as a threat, and to generally suffocate anything else they saw as a threat to their business model. The anticompetitive nature of Facebook&rsquo;s Instagram and WhatsApp purchase isn't really in my wheelhouse, but how the API was used for anticompetitive activity most definitely is my speciality. I am happy to see the FTC finally elevate the abuse that has been going on at Facebook via it&rsquo;s APIs, not just because of the impact on the Facebook developer community, but more importantly the wider tech sector. Facebook&rsquo;s approach hurts wider competition across the tech sector, but also hurts the space API sector--ultimately giving APIs a bad reputation. To help me speak intelligently to what is occurring as part of the FTC&rsquo;s lawsuit, offer my advice on what a remedy might be, while also contributing to the future of regulation in the tech sector, I wanted to gather my thoughts in a post here on the blog.&nbsp; Anticompetitive Conditioning Using The Facebook API The acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp by Facebook to neutralize threats in two keys areas are a...[<a href="/2020/12/12/apis-are-at-the-center-of-the-federal-trade-commission-ftc-lawsuit-against-facebook/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>05 Dec 2020</em></p>
			<p>I have been neck deep in the release of Postman public workspaces lately. So much so, I haven't had much time to gather my thoughts about what exactly they are, and why they matter. Time for a burst of storytelling to help me make sense of just what is a public APIi workspace. One of the most common responses I've heard from folks that I talk with about public workspaces is that they are most comparable to a public GitHub repository, but designed just for APIs. Fair enough. While I see Postman public workspaces as much more than a Github public repository, it provides a great place to start when it comes to helping folks understand the potential. To help me be more articulate when it comes to speaking about why public workspaces matter, let me compare them to public repositories, and speak of the impact that GitHub has had on my reality, as well as on the wider API community. GitHub Changed My Life I have been using Github since 2010, but beginning in 2014 I began operating a significant portion of my API operations via GitHub. I ran all of my public presence there from 2014 through 2020, and I still regularly use it as a base for many API projects, and for publishing JSON and YAML files. In the last year I have pulled back much of my web presence for API Evangelist back from Github, but I still depend on it for most of my projects for the following reasons.&nbsp; Free - It is free to publish repos to Github, making it a pretty sweet place to publish APIs, schema, JSON, YAML, code, and other artifacts. Network - The network effect of Github is huge. Developers get it, and the access and discoverability that comes with the platform are worth it.&nbsp; Social - The social layer GitHub added to Git is really what makes the platform as powerful as it is,...[<a href="/2020/12/05/gathering-my-thoughts-on-public-api-workspaces/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>05 Dec 2020</em></p>
			<p>I have long been fascinated by the Run in Postman Button. A Run in Postman button can be published from any Postman collection, organizing a single, or a series of API calls into collection of API requests, and then letting them be imported and ran locally by any consumer, as a cloud monitor, or via a pipeline. Run in Postman buttons are a common way for API providers to onboard new developers with their APIs, and stay engaged with active developers through collections they&rsquo;ve download via Run in Postman buttons. These embeddable goodies attached to Postman collections and potentially environments are very powerful unit of API execution, but I am finding that the label &ldquo;run&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t sufficient in articulating what is possible with each collection, and I a looking to get a little more precise when it comes to my vocabulary attached to each Postman button I publish. The Run in Postman Button Fundamentals A Postman collection is basically a portable folder of API requests. Using Postman, developers can define the parts of one of many API requests, including the URL, parameters, headers, body, and authentication, then roll them all up as a collection that can be shared with other developers, and published as documentation, as well as using a Run in Postman button. This embeddable HTML or markdown button can be published alongside documentation, or more dynamically as individual buttons on any HTML or markdown page, attaching each button to the following elements:&nbsp; Collections - Each button can execute a single collection of one or many API requests, complete with pre-request and post-request scripts. Environments - Each button can possess a single environment that can contain a variety of key / value pairs for authentication, and other purposes. You can find Run in Postman buttons sprinkled across Twitter API documentation, providing one click import of collections into each developers own workspace, where they can manually run, or automate using a monitors, or trigger via...[<a href="/2020/12/05/expanding-the-vocabulary-for-run-in-postman-buttons/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>What is an API? An API is a digital interface for sharing data, content, and algorithms with web, mobile, and device applications using the Internet, building on web technologies to make digital resources available across many different applications. APIs have been around since computers and their networks first gained a foothold back in the 1960s, but with the rise of the web since 2000, a new breed of APIs have emerged which has changed how we build and use technology, and introduced entirely new ways of doing business, but sadly, they have also introduced entirely new ways of exploiting an destabilizing the physical world around us. APIs aren&rsquo;t the latest techno solutionism, although they are oftentimes billed as that, they are the digital currents that flow around us each day. APIs power the web and mobile applications we depend on each day, while also steadily working to redefine our physical worlds by connecting everything to the Internet&mdash;reshaping our virtual and physical worlds, while also remaking who we are as humans along the way. Websites Are for Humans The web as we know it has been evolving for over 50 years, but in the 1990s it became something we were able to access in our homes and businesses, laying the foundation for the ubiquitous web of applications we now access in our homes via laptops, televisions, and other appliances, as well as our cars, in our businesses, and across our communities in the form of security cameras, traffic infrastructure, digital signage and much more. Websites are hypertext markup language (HTML) that are designed to be rendered for humans in a browser, making the text, images, and other media consumable by humans using their eyes and ears, and navigated using our fingers via touch screens, keyboards, and increasingly voice controls.

			<p><em>23 Nov 2020</em></p>
			<p>I am using Postman to do more governance on my OpenAPI definitions as part of their API lifecycle. This is a top request of customers I am talking to, so I want to get better at make these individual API lifecycle capabilities much more modular and reusable as Postman collections. In Postman, the OpenAPI is the truth for each API contract throughout the API lifecycle, but each collection has become how you automate each stop along the API lifecycle. Resulting in me needing the OpenAPI for each API I am automating, and being able to pull the OpenAPI truth using the Postman API within each collection I am defining to mock, document, test, and govern each API. You can find a single collection for pulling the OpenAPI for an API from the Postman API using it&rsquo;s name (boy that is a mouthful). The collection is designed to abstract away three separate API calls into a single request. Ideally Postman will provide a similar API endpoint, but until that happens I have this collection to help make things easier. The documentation for the collection should provide you with everything you need to get up and running with the collection, pulling the API into a Postman environment for reuse. It is up to you to decide what you will do with the OpenAPI after that, possibly making multiple changes, and then saving back to Postman using the API. If you have any questions on the collection for pulling the OpenAPI as part of the API lifecycle, feel free to submit a comment for the collection as part of the OpenAPI workspace. I&rsquo;ll be centralizing the evolution of this collection, as well as other OpenAPI related collections within this workspace. You can also fork the collection and use in your workspaces, and submit back any enhancements you&rsquo;d like to see as a pull request.

			<p><em>23 Nov 2020</em></p>
			<p>I am managing more collections via hundreds of different workspaces lately. As part of my work I am needing to make bulk changes to collections based upon a variety of properties. Sometimes I need to find and replace variables, and other times I need to rewrite or append to the descriptions for each collection. Whil I am sure eventually there will be capabilities to do some of this via the Postman interface, I find creating maintenance collections that use the Postman API to do what I need is the quickest way to get what I want, without having to wait for the Postman road map to catch up to my work. I have a whole list of automated changes I want to make to Postman collections that I am generating from OpenAPI definitions, and to help me quickly work through this list I wanted to create a base collection that I could use to augment with common and some unique scripts for making changes to any collection, and then save the results back using the Postman API. You can find this collection in my public workspace for managing my collection work, where you can fork it and apply to the changes you need to make to collections. You are also welcome to just wait until I get specialized collections built, or feel free to submit a suggestion for a variation that maybe I haven&rsquo;t considered. If you have any questions on the collection for pulling a collection and making changes using the Postman API, feel free to submit a comment for the collection as part of the collection workspace. I&rsquo;ll be centralizing the evolution of this collection, as well as other collection related collections within this workspace.

			<p><em>23 Nov 2020</em></p>
			<p>I am having an increasing number of conversations around how the leading API specifications work together, and what the role of each are when it comes to various stops along the API lifecycle. To help drive conversations I wanted to create a single blog post I can link to, while also loading up all of my fresh thoughts about API specs into my old brain. All of these API specifications are continuing to see massive adoption across API providers and consumers, and they are all in forward motion being iterated upon by the specification owners, so it helps to pause once or twice a year and take a look at what is going on, and work to understand how all of these API specifications work together (or don&rsquo;t). What Are The Leading API Specifications There are a handful of API specifications that are relevant to delivering APIs in 2020, helping provide a vocabulary for stakeholders in the process to use when describing what each API does, so that a common definition can be applied through the API lifecycle, consistently delivering API infrasture across many teams. Here are the API specifications I am focusing on as part of my API Specification Toolbox conversations. OpenAPI - A specification for defining the surface area of HTTP 1.1 web APIs using JSON or YAML. AsyncAPI - A specification for defining the surface area of HTTP 1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, TCP, MQTT, and AMQP APIs using JSON or YAML. JSON Schema - A specification for defining the underlying models in use for APIs, adopted by both OpenAPI and AsyncAPI. Postman Collections - A specification for defining executable collections of HTTP 1.1 web APIs for running in services and tooling Postman Environments -&nbsp;A specification for defining key / value pairs that get applied across collections at execute time. RAML - A YAML format for describing the surface area of your HTTP 1.1 APIs, and the the underlying objects.

			<p><em>18 Nov 2020</em></p>
			<p>Managing the size of an OpenAPI is a common challenge for API development teams. I have regular conversations with teams about the ways in which you can minimize the overall scope of an API, breaking things down into more manageable chunks, while also reducing redundancy&mdash;then encouraging reuse. Like other dimensions of the API space there are differing opinions on whether it is better to have one single OpenAPI for all of your APIs, or whether it makes more sense to break things down into well defined bounded contexts. You can see this debate occurring in Monolith vs Microservices, and MonoRepo vs Multi-Repo discussions across the API space. In this game, there are no right or wrong answers, just different approaches that work well for different organizations, teams, and individuals. My goal is to help folks understand the trade-offs by informing them enough to make their own decisions and set into motion API design practices that keep the API factory floor moving along. The size of your APIs matter. The size of your OpenAPI for your APIs matters. The scope, complexity, and consistency of your APIs will define how easy they are to maintain and put to work. Organizations that do not use OpenAPI struggle with being able to define the API landscape at all, let alone being able to define the scope of individual APIs or groups of APIs. It is common for API providers who are moving into the OpenAPI realm to slam into the brick wall of API scope right away, realizing their OpenAPI definitions are too big to work with in some services and tooling, and become a maze of complexity when it comes to maintenance and consumption. While there are many ways your API design practices can reduce or at least better define the scope of your APIs and resulting APIs, there are a handful of ways you can slice and dice your APIs up to make them easier to manage,...[<a href="/2020/11/18/managing-the-scope-of-your-openapi/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Nov 2020</em></p>
			<p>I owe an answer on my thoughts about mocking APIs to my coworker Andy, and I don&rsquo;t want to incur his wrath, so I figured I&rsquo;d write it up and share wider as I was getting back to him. I don&rsquo;t have the original question cause it was in a Zoom chat, but it was something to the effect of using mock APIs to move forward the design of an API versus using them to drive application development conversations as well as push testing forward. I&rsquo;d say that using a mock as part of an API-first design process reflects where I am pushing mocks to work for me more often. I still use them to demo, prototype applications, and as part of API testing, but using them to actually evolve the contract for an API is really where I feel that a mock server will really shine, and can shift how we are delivering APIs. However, there is also a lot of education and awareness needed before I get all the folks I am having conversations with on board with this concept&mdash;to help in these efforts I wanted to flesh out&nbsp;a little about what I mean when it comes to API-first usage of mock APIs. Mocking From Postman Collections The first part of this conversation involves the concept that you can generate a mock server from any Postman collection. There is a three step process involved with producing a mock API in Postman using a collection. First you create a collection with the path and parameters you would like to use as the definition of the API you are mocking. Once you have your path you can select examples up near the send button and add a new example for this request. It will take your path with parameters and map to a new example where you can add a JSON example to represent what should be returned by your mock server for an example....[<a href="/2020/11/17/using-api-mocks-as-part-of-an-apifirst-workflow/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>API deployment is the OG stop along the API lifecycle, but is still the most underserved when it comes to API service providers providing solutions, and as part of the full lifecycle API management conversation. I remember back in 2011 folks asking me which of the API management providers would help them deploy their APIs, which at the time none of them would, being a pretty regular concern when it came to doing APIs at all, let alone doing them well. I have seen many &ldquo;API deployment&rdquo; solutions come and go, and after a decade I see some movements forward, but overall API deployment is still really difficult in ways that just doesn't make sense. Data APIs Making data available via simple APIs is the most common type of APIs you will come across out there, and the most common reason for providing as well as consuming APIs. Deploying data APIs are pretty straightforward to do, and there have been a wide variety of services and tooling made available to help developers deliver these types of APIs. Even with the simplicity of this type of APIs, I haven&rsquo;t seen too many platform successfully monetize a data API deployment solution, or deliver a dead simple, widely adopted, single push of a button solution to delivering data APIs. It really is one of those areas that should have been 100% solved by now, and would be if it was for the incentive models that exists behind most platforms, but also due to some pretty widespread unhealthy practices when it comes to managing and publishing data, making a lot of data pretty messy to work with when it comes to making available data APIs. Content APIs These types of APIs often overlap with the world of data APIs, but I want to highlight them separately because of content delivery network (CDN) considerations, as well as movements in the headless CMS world when it comes to enabling dead simple...[<a href="/2020/11/17/the-multiple-dimensions-of-api-deployment/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>12 Nov 2020</em></p>
			<p>I have been conducting weekly discussions around API specifications each Friday mornings which I call the API Specification Toolbox. The goal is to just identify ways in which we can drive more discussion and participation in API specifications, focusing on OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, GraphQL, and Postman Collections. My goal is to help increase awareness of these specifications, but more importantly get more people sharing what they are working on and invest more time and resources into supporting the specifications. I conduct an hour of informal discussions from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM PST each Friday, and we record as many of our ideas and talking points on Github using issues. Some interesting ideas have emerged from the discussion, and I am taking some of the lowest hanging fruit from these ideas, organizing them, and working with the OAI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Postman team to try and bring some of these ideas to life.&nbsp; There are many other ideas that didn&rsquo;t make my starter list of project, but these are the ones I feel are the most important, would have the the greatest impact, and be achievable in small bursts of work, and to help drive some conversation I am having, I wanted to flesh out some of the top ideas here on the blog. I cleaned up the titles for each of these ideas, and grouped them based upon the type of project, and I would like to flesh out a little more, identify how they overlap and are related&mdash;then work to actually push them forward without me doing all of the work. I feel like with some assistance from the wider API community, and some investment from the OAI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Postman, these projects could make a pretty significant impact on what is going on across the API landscapes.

			<p>I have a single API request that is becoming the first call I make on a growing number of Postman ccollections. It is a call to the Postman API to pull the OpenAPI for any API I am managing using Postman. This gives me the OpenAPI contract for an API so that I can move forward as part of a variety of stops along the lifecycle, starting with mocking, documentation, and testing as part of an API-first approach, but then also potentially monitoring, securing, generate client code, or even deployment and management of an API. I am working with a number of API service providers to define Postman collections that go well beyond the common APIs you will find in the Postman API Network, helping develop entirely new categories of collections that are designed to deliver different stops along the API lifecycle, so I am looking to develop a playbook for how you create one of these new types of collections, baking your API services into the Postman platform. Publish a Team Page Any partnership with an API service provider and the Postman platform begins with publishing of a team profile to the Postman network. Providing a logo, name, and description for your company, creating your official team profile on the Postman platform&mdash;here is my reference API implementation team page from the Postman API network.&nbsp; You can manage your team profile under your team settings in your Postman dashboard. You can upload a logo, choose a name, and provide a description. When ready, you can choose to make your profile public, choosing a subdomain for your company on the Postman platform.&nbsp; This is the profile for your API services on the Postman platform, accessible by 13 million developers via their desktop application and on the web.

			<p>I am pushing forward a handful of conversations with enterprise organizations about how to better formalize their API lifecycle workflow. To help me load up my talking points in my head I wanted to publish a post here on the blog. Using Postman I am finally able to actually execute on my API lifecycle visions in the most tangible way since I started doing all of this in 2010. Postman is a Swiss Army Knife that allows me to approach the API lifecycle in a variety of ways depending on the situation I find myself in. While there are a lot of unknowns when it comes to doing APIs, there are also a lot of common patterns to use, and this is an exploration of these standardized approaches, allowing me to articulate them tomorrow during some discussions. Workspace It may seem obvious, but I am finding that having a well defined workspace to define, design, and manage APIs is essential to doing APIs well. Having a single place where you can find the contract and supporting artifacts that define each of the stops along the API lifecycle is needed to do all of this at scale, and consistently collaborate and move APIs forward. There are a handful of elements needed to define an API workspace when you are using Postman. Name - You'd be surprised at how important the name of an API can be when it comes to making it discoverable and usable by consumers--how you name your API will define a lot about it. Description - A well written description for an API is your first impression when it comes to onboarding consumers. They shouldn't be a novel, but it should provide enough information for a consumer to understand what it does. Administrative Team Members - Have your leadership team identified, make sure they are plugged in and know what needs to be done, giving them the control and observability they need.

			<p>When you sign up to access most APIs you will have to sign up for an account, create an application, and retrieve a set of keys and / or tokens before you will be able to use the API. This is standard practice that is baked into the home grown as well as Commercial API management solutions available across the landscape. This is a concept that was introduced back in 2005 by Mashery, and is something that hasn&rsquo;t changed much over the years, despite what we build on top of APIs, and use APIs for having changed significantly over the last decade. In 2020, this relic of API management past needs to evolve if API providers and consumers are going to use APIs to their fullest potential&mdash;something API management service providers are going to have to take the lead on, and get back to work innovating and not just being a commodity. When I sign up for Twitter&rsquo;s API I have to create an application before I can get the tokens I need to begin using the application. I have to provide a name, purpose, and other details about what that application is&mdash;even if I do not fully understand what that is. Most API provider&rsquo;s notion of an application means web or mobile application, but in reality it can be the &ldquo;application&rdquo; of the data, content, and algorithms being made available via an API in a variety of ways from just pulling data to integrating in real-time with other systems. As an API analyst and storyteller I rarely am building an application, but just looking to kick the tires and understand what is going on&mdash;being forced to define an application is nothing but a road block for me. I may be a small group of API consumers, but there are many other edge cases which are similar to my situation in that we represent the long tail of API consumption in the unknown unknown API...[<a href="/2020/10/28/shifting-how-api-providers-define-what-an-application-is-when-onboarding-and-integrating-with-their-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>The COVID-19 API resource center we launched back in April at Postman was a success. It generated a lot of traffic and API usage, but also brought in about 75 API submissions from the community. One of the things we learned as part of this work is that more APIs doesn&rsquo;t always mean better outcomes. More APIs means they have to be properly described and tagged, making them more discoverable, but you also need to make they are all &ldquo;good&rdquo; APIs. Which, once you begin to dive in, you realize that it becomes quite a can of worms, but luckily we have the APIs.yaml specification to help us map things out in a way that allows to slowly evolve things from human to machine readable. When it came to the COVID-19 data APIs were were making available one key element of &ldquo;good&rdquo; was knowing a little more about provenance behind each of the APIs, helping us see the overlap between all of the APIs, as well as the unique outliers who were providing new and novel resources. First, to make sure everyone is up to speed, APIs.json / APIs.yaml is a simple machine readable index for defining collections of APIs, and mapping out API operations. In this scenario I am using APIs.json as the core of an API toolbox that runs 100% on GitHub using Jekyll and Github Pages. In addition to indexing the documentation and Postman collections for each API, I am adding a provenance property to help define where the data behind each API originate, producing YAML that looks like this. Right now the x-sources APIs.yaml property just provides an array of name and urls for each of the data sources behind each API. Mostly just providing a list of URL sources that can be displayed, but it is a property that could be evolved to provide more machine readable capabilities like grouped by domain, rating, public or private sector, and other things...[<a href="/2020/10/06/providing-source-metadata-as-part-of-the-api-json-index-for-data-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>One of the regular patrons of my weekly Friday open office hours around API specifications has been with API expert Marjukka Niinioja (@mniinioja), and a couple of weeks back we carved off 30 minutes to discuss the important of OpenAPI, other specifications, and the need for more education and awareness around specifications. I spend 30 minutes getting Marjukka&rsquo;s view of the landscape, and more insight into why she thinks API specifications are so important, take a listen for yourself.

What I like about chatting with Marjukka is that she gets APIs, especially OpenAPI, but more importantly she is passionate and motivate to contribute back to the community. I speak to many people about OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Postman Collections, and JSON Schema, but finding folks like Marjukka who are driven to help document, tell stories, and help move things forward. Thanks for your time Marjukka, and if any of you readers want to learn more about what she is working on you can join us for the regular API Specification Toolbox office hours each Friday.[<a href="/2020/10/05/talking-about-the-importance-of-api-specifications-with-marjukka-niinioja-mniinioja/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Sep 2020</em></p>
			<p>This is a talk I gave Saturday this last morning to almost 100 students in India, helping demonstrate the potential of APIs when it comes to their career. It is easy for me to stay entrenched in a world where everyone knows what an API is, but these types of conversations help me break out of the API echo chamber and reach out to developers, would-be developers, and those are curious enough to pull back the curtains on how the web works a little bit. With this talk I am looking to convert a few more folks to my API religion. Not because APIs are always good, but because being aware of the API layer that exists beneath our digital, and increasingly physical world is important. You will be more successful in both your personal and professional lives if you are API aware, and with this talk I am looking to help lay the foundation for anyone, developer or non-developer to understand the importance of API in our digital world. What is an API?&nbsp; An API, or application programming interface is the current evolution of the web when it comes to making data, content, media, and algorithms available to different types of applications. Websites are written in HTML, and designed to be displayed to humans in our browsers. All you have to do is right click on any web page you visit and select view source to see the HTML behind any web page you are visiting. APIs provide access to the same data, content, and images used in websites, but instead of returning HTML, it returns XML or JSON which developers can render exactly as they wish in the application they are delivering. APIs are not some new software from one of the technology giants, it is just the next evolution in the web, making sure we can use deliver the same data, content, and algorithms across the applications we run on our laptops,...[<a href="/2020/09/20/why-apis-should-matter-to-you/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>19 Sep 2020</em></p>
			<p>I have to write these posts every so often to help folks understand who I am and what it is I do as the API Evangelist. You see, there are regular streams of people who attempt to define me based upon their view of the world, their belief system, and reduce me to a know series of transactions that compute in their version of reality. In the tech arena there are several variations of what I do for living, going by a handful of labels; evangelist, advocate, relations, ambassador, champion, or some other word. None of these disciplines possess a formal definition, and are perpetually defined by the people who fill these roles. I am not in the business of defining what people do when they wear these titles, or generalize any of them as good, bad, nor neutral.&nbsp;They are just like tech in my experience, and are only as a good or bad as the human beings they serve, and I&rsquo;m not really in a place where I give many fucks about policing any of this. However, when people say evangelists are doing bad things I tend to take offense, and sometimes feel compelled to put some words down within my domain (hrumph!). Technology and API evangelists existed before I came around in 2010, but after doing this a decade, and playing this part for enough time, I&rsquo;ve earned the right to push back, and call bullshit on the shade being thrown in my direction.&nbsp; First, I am an evangelist. I will even let my ego step up and say that I am The API Evangelist. I&rsquo;ve put down my mark. Paid my dues. I&rsquo;ve stayed the course for over ten years now, worked for the White House, with governments around the world, and most of the biggest names in tech in one capacity or another. Pure ego baby! I&rsquo;m good with it. Ego is required to be in the role at this level....[<a href="/2020/09/19/i-am-an-evangelist/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>My partners in crime Metadata Technologies North America (MTNA) and I are working on identifying the best election data and API resources available today, and one of the gems out there, when it comes to what is available is out of the politics and sports data platform FiveThirtyEight. The data storytelling platform have made a name for themselves when it comes to predicting election outcomes, and possess some very interesting datasets around elections, which they public via a simple landing page, and on GitHub in a public repository. FiveThirtyEight Data Page - A simple page outlining all their data resources. FiveThirtyEight Data Repo - All the datasets they have in a single GitHub repo. FiveThirtyEight has general poll data, but also data for more precise questions like &ldquo;How Popular is Donald Trump?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Are Democrats or Republicans Winning the Race for Congress?&rdquo;. They provide data as CSV files via their data page and on GitHub, making it easy to get at the data behind polling and storytelling. I am working with MTNA to take things a step further, and ingesting the data files and publishing them as simple APIs, then generating collections that index all the APIs, making it easier to access all the election related files in a single collection, while also opening up the possibilities for using Postman visualizer to make sense of the data being returned. Providing self-contained API client for all the data, complete with charts, graphs, and other eye candy that make it easier to understand what is happening. I really like the&nbsp;happening approach to publishing the data via their dedicated page because it is dead simple, providing a title, more info, and a CSV download, as well as column saying how long it has been since it was updated&mdash;down to the minute.&nbsp;Providing everything you need to understand what is going on with each dataset.

			<p><em>10 Sep 2020</em></p>
			<p>I am including the U.S. Census API in a couple of different projects in the queue, and to help me make the API more discoverable and usable by developers I needed an OpenAPI and Postman collection for the API. Helping make it easier for developers to on-board with the Census API, but also provide a base collection I can use to develop additional workflow collections that help provide specific types of data easier to use in variety of use cases. Our data API partners over at Metadata Technology North America (MTNA) is helping us deploy APIs on top of some valuable datasets as part of our COVID-19 resource center, and they offered to help us develop the OpenAPI and Postman collection for the U.S. Census API. Carson Hunter (@carrrson) from MTNA got to work crafting an OpenAPI 3.0 for the Census API, providing a pretty robust source of truth for the API, which we can then use to generate Postman collections to document, mock, test, and automate around the Census API, but also just use the collection as a client for running different queues and saving the results of API responses to files without having to write code. Carson did the extra work of also creating a Postman collection and publishing as documentation, helping make the API a little easier to navigate, while also making sure there is a &ldquo;Run in Postman" button available so that developers can quickly begin putting to work within their own Postman workspaces. Carson helped reduce the friction when it comes to onboarding with the Census API, while also helping me make it more discoverable as part of the various API projects I am working on. There is a lot more work we can do on these reference OpenAPI and Postman collection, but we wanted to just pause and put out there for others to comment on what they would like to see.

			<p>One of my current tasks at Postman is to help explore what the future of API deployment looks like. When I went into this work I expected serverless to play a significant role, but I have to admit I didn&rsquo;t anticipate the ways in which serverless would be used to reduce the steps it takes to actually deploy APIs. One of the tools I have been playing with for a couple of months now is Nimbella, which describes itself as &ldquo;the simplest way to build and run serverless applications&rdquo;. I spent significant amounts of time building collections for deploying APIs to AWS using Lambda earlier this year, so when I had an API deploying in just a couple of minutes with Nimbella, you can say I was pretty impressed with what they have done to serverless by making it easy, but also bringing in the critical ingredients you need to actually deliver meaningful apps. Nimbella is free to get started. Once you have logged in you can fire up your first project within 60 seconds, after installing the Nimbella CLI for Mac, Windows, or Linux. Once you have the CLI installed you can just execute: nim auth login [your token]&nbsp; This command, plus all three runtimes are available on the home page of you account once you have signed up--then you can choose to install a single one of their start projects with: nim project deploy github:nimbella/demo-projects/qrcode nim project deploy github:nimbella/demo-projects/visits nim project deploy github:nimbella/demo-projects/ocr nim project deploy github:nimbella/demo-projects/chat Or you can go ahead and clone all of their demo projects, which I recommend, because it allows you to reverser engineer a whole suite of simple serverless micro applications: git clone https://github.com/nimbella/demo-projects Within five minutes you can be reverse engineering what is possible when you deploy APIs and/or applications with Nimbella. With each Nimbella project you begin with two folders locally on your machine, the power your implementation: Functions - This is the functional API...[<a href="/2020/09/09/smoothing-the-rough-edges-off-serverless-with-nimbella/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am continue my storytelling around the work I am doing with Nimbella to help define what the future of API deployment looks like from within Postman, and next up on my list to do some storytelling around&nbsp;the Nimbella Postman Plugin, which allows you to deploy the server-side scaffolding for an API in seven programming languages from a Postman collection. Nimbella is a dead simple way to deploy serverless APIs and applications, which also possesses a plugin infrastructure that lets you extend the platform, and one of the plugins the Nimbella team has developed allows you to design your APIs using a Postman collection, then generate your serverless API project in Go, Node.js, Typescript, Python, Java, Swift, or PHP.&nbsp; Once you have signed up and logged into Nimbella, and installed the CLI for the platform, you can add the Postman plugin at the command line using: nim plugins add postman You can find the Postman plugin for Nimbella on Github if you are looking to take things to the next level, but installing it is pretty dead simple with the one CLI statement. You can find all the usage options available for the Nimbella Postman CLI plugin on the GitHub README, but here is a basic command that will generate an API project from any of your Postman collections. nim project create -s postman -i Products --language js This creates a new local Nimbella API project for me using a Postman collection in one of my Postman workspaces simple named &ldquo;Products&rdquo; in JavaScript. As soon as I want this API to be available in the cloud, I simply run this command: nim project deploy . Now I have my API.

			<p><em>03 Sep 2020</em></p>
			<p>I am hung up (once again) on the fact that I can&rsquo;t post to my personal Facebook feed via the Graph API. Facebook removed the ability for you to add or update to your Facebook feed via the API in 2018. You can still post to pages via the API, but are out of luck via your personal profile. It drives me nuts because I queue, schedule, and automate a significant amount of my online presence. Honestly Facebook doesn&rsquo;t do much for my personal or professional online presence, but the fact that I can&rsquo;t do it is driving me nuts. I have an idea I want to implement around telling stories on Facebook, and without the ability to post via the API, the idea is a non-starter. I really bothers me when I can POST or PUT to any platform I depend on, and the fact that it is Facebook drives me even more nuts, making it something that I just can&rsquo;t seem to put down. Posting to My Facebook Wall Using Postman While you can&rsquo;t officially add to your feed via the official Facebook API, you can using Postman. You can install the Postman Interceptor Chrome extension, proxy traffic, and isolate the API call you need to post to your feed, including all the configuration and cookies you will need to make it work. I will write a separate post that walks through how to do this, but I just want to think through all of this before I move forward teaching other people how to do this. Like most everything with APIs, this isn&rsquo;t just technical, and there are numerous business and political considerations to flesh out before I just plow forward teaching everyone how to circumvent Facebooks limitations. I am not sure I want to me sharing this knowledge, let alone polishing the rough edges so that it is something that a wider audience can implement.

I am looking to showcase the potential of using an OpenAPI as a base of the API integration and development lifecycle, and today I wanted to showcase what you can quickly do when you put the OpenAPI for the Twitter API into a Postman workspace.

This OpenAPI can act as the truth for a variety of lifecycle activities, but to begin with I usually generate two collections. One for providing reference documentation for the entire API, and another to provide me with a mock representation of the entire surface area of the API, helping me articulate what the API does to team members, while also kicking the etires on it before I have to obtain a token or key.

This approach isn't unique to the Twitter API, and can be used by API providers to guide the development of APIs, or it can be done by API consumers to help localize documentation, mock servers, and other resources you will need to work with an API. If you want to see it in action you can walk through a short video, showing how you can do this in just a few minutes using Postman.

			<p>Like other successful API patterns REST and GraphQL have been in competition for mindshare since GraphQL emerged on the landscape. GraphQL folks love to say it is a replacement for REST, and the RESTafarians love to point out GraphQL&rsquo;s weaknesses. When in reality they are both very useful patterns that API providers and consumers should be aware of, and possess in their API toolboxes. In an effort to continue showcasing the importance of having a diverse API toolbox, I wanted to take a walk through my GitHub API workspace, which I use personally, but wanted to take a spin through it to help polish some of the rougher edges of my approach, before I invite some other team members to use my workspace. An OpenAPI and GraphQL Core While I have many orphan API collections laying around in workspaces, my more robust workspaces tend to leverage OpenAPI as the truth of each API, but with the GitHub API I have the opportunity to provide both an OpenAPI and GraphQL API side by side in a single workspace. Providing me with the base for all of the collections I am generating, evolving, and making work for me when integrating, automating, and orchestrating with the GitHub API. GitHub V3 OpenAPI - GitHub maintains an OpenAPI definition for their web API, allowing anyone to use as the base for generating docs, mocks, tests, and integrate, automate, and orchestrate across the API lifecycle. GotJib v4 GraphQL - I pulled the schema definition language (SDL) for the GitHub GraphQL, and published it as an API, which I can then use to generate collections&mdash;there is only a single endpoint, but still provides me with a base. These two API contracts provide me with a machine readable description of what is possible when it comes to working with the GitHub API. However, both of these require you to be fluent in OpenAPI and / or GraphQL to be able to get what...[<a href="/2020/09/01/a-diverse-api-workspace-example-using-openapi-and-graphql-from-github/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>One of the teams I work closely with at Postman is the group behind mocking APIs with Postman. The ability to statically mock APIs has received a lot of investment when it comes to recent releases, and in a couple of my Postman partner conversations I have been asked for more information about how to mock API using Postman. So, in an effort to reach the widest possible audience as I can, I wanted to write up an overview on the current state of mocking APIs using Postman, to help get everyone up to speed&mdash;including myself. ;-) Overview of Mocks Using Postman To get started with understanding the value of mocking APIs I recommend visiting the dedicated marketing page Postman has up for mocking APIs. This provides you with the meat of what you&rsquo;ll need to make the argument for mocks across your team, as well as your leadership. See Exactly How Your API will Run&mdash;Even Before It's in Production - API design is the key to building quality APIs that last. Postman's mock API servers simplify design and planning, support split-stack development, and help you ensure that your API will run the way it's supposed to in production. Shorten Time to Production - Work more efficiently with Postman's API mock servers. Postman mocks support split-stack development so front-end and back-end developers can work in parallel and view responses without spinning up the back end. Design Your API with Flexible Schema Support - Postman mock servers complement Postman's extended schema support. Write, edit, or import your API schema to define your API's data structure and generate a collection from your API schema. You can review API responses using mock servers so you can reliably build your API from the ground up&mdash;all in one central place. Simulate the Expected Behavior of Your API - Postman Mock Servers simulate API responses that applications and services can utilize even before the API is built.

			<p>One of the reason you always want to surround yourself with people who call bullshit on meaningless trends is that when you begin to fall under the spell of each wave of API blah blah blah, they will slap you upside the head and remind you what this is all about. This happened to me the other day when I mistakenly mentioned that the future of APIs is event-driven, and Fran Méndez (@fmvilas) from AsyncAPI slapped me upside the head and reminded that the future is about possessing a diverse API toolbox, allowing you to apply just the right approach to APIs for the job. Making sure we are equipped to deliver useful and meaningful APIs, not just the latest API blah blah blah because we heard it was cool somewhere. HTTP APIs, or as they are often referred to as REST APIs, are always the base layer for any API operation. This is where everyone should begin, but there are a number of other healthy patterns in use that teams should be aware of, and able to confidently implement. I began working working on this narrative back in March of 2017 with a Focus on Having a Robust and Diverse API Toolbox, which is something I kept expanding on in January of 2018 with My Evolving Definition of a Robust and Diverse API Toolbox, culminating in a talk that I gave at API Days Paris about APIs Not Just Being REST. I am thankful for Fran slapping me and reminding me that I shouldn’t fall under the spell of any single API design pattern, and that a diversity in learnings and implementations is critical to being successful in the API long game. REST, SOAP, Hypermedia, GraphQL, WebSub, Kafka, and many other successful API patterns dot the landscape. REST is dominant because it is simple and reflects the web, but as many practitioners point out, it will begin to fail you in a variety of...[<a href="/2020/08/31/a-diverse-api-toolbox-is-the-future/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>The discovery of APIs has been the single most significant issue I&rsquo;ve tracked on and contributed to over my career as the API Evangelist. It is also one of the stops along the API lifecycle I have been very frustrated with due to a lack of things moving forward over the last decade. While there has been many failed attempts at folks trying to bring new API solutions to the table, the conversation really hasn&rsquo;t gone anywhere. That is, until the last couple of years, where we are seeing a new crop of interesting API service providers who are looking to address API discovery in new and interesting ways, bundling the discovery of APIs with other functions that help speak to the business bottom line, going well beyond just searching for APIs across the enterprise, or on the open web. I am tuned into a handful of new API focused startups who are coming at API discovery from a variety of angles, but one of them I have been meeting with weekly to discuss the importance of API discovery, but also API governance, is with the folks from TeejLab, who provide a view of the API discovery landscape through the enterprise risk management lens. TeejLab&rsquo;s API discovery solution isn&rsquo;t some API catalog or search engine, they help you discovery APIs across your existing operations, then evaluate and better manage how they are put work moving forward. Helping enterprise organizations find the existing internal, partner, and public APIs they already depend on is the #1 challenge enterprise organizations face right, and it is a problem that is only going to exponentially get worse in coming years. This is what makes TeejLab&rsquo;s so relevant, in that they don&rsquo;t just help you discover your APIs so you can use them, they help you assess the security, privacy, licensing, and other risks that come with unmanaged, ungoverned API chaos that exists across most enterprise organizations today.

			<p>I was needing a simple way to move forward a variety of API conversations I am having, ranging from COVID-19 APIs to API service providers who are using OpenAPI. I need a quick way to be able to flesh out a list of APIs, tooling, and specification that can be leveraged by developers when it comes to tackling a specific problem within an industry, issue, or conversation. This is an evolution in our strategy for shining a spotlight on the COVID-19, helping me better figure out how we can keep adding value to the COVID-19 discussion, but also quickly do the same in other areas. For the COVID-19 effort we threw up a landing page and GitHub repository back in March, and since then we&rsquo;ve seen some pretty interesting submissions and conversation come out of the community. Improving Upon the COVID-19 API Resource Center The COVID-19 API Resource Center is a listing of Postman API collection we&rsquo;ve developed, curated, and accepted from the community.&nbsp; We seed the resource center with 15 collections, and received 36 collections from the community, with 25 submission awaiting for a Postman collection to be developed so the API can be added to the list. For a total of 51 collections available on the COVID-19 resource center, providing a range of resources from data on COVID-19 cases and deaths to drugs and testing information. We successfully used GitHub to accept community submissions via issues, and evolve a pretty robust list of resources, but some of the APIs and resulting collections were of higher quality than others, and I wanted to understand why. To help me understand I went through all of them identifying the areas the could use more investment when it comes to helping individual collections, as well as the overall toolbox of collections, better serve the mission to help us in the COVID-19 fight.

			<p>I am getting more hands-on with my API governance guidance while working at Postman. It is one of the reasons I joined the company, so I could move more into the execution of my API lifecycle strategies, which also includes applying API governance. To showcase some of what I have been developing I am doing an API governance webinar this Wednesday. To help me polish the narrative around my talk, as well as my wider API governance guidance, I wanted to work through my current narrative here on the blog. What I am enjoying most about my narrative right now is that they are rooted in doing what I am talking about, allow me to get more hands-on with API governance, where for much of the last five years my stories have just been narratives without much meat on the bone. I am enjoying this shift from a more academic perspective to actually being able to deliver what I am talking about when I say API governance. An Intro API Governance Most people will go straight to API design governance when they begin talking about governance, but I prefer starting with the base of API governance that is already in motion across many API operations. Born out of an API-first approach to delivering infrastructure many teams are already delivering on governance, they just call it other names like versioning and contract testing. This is definitely the road to API governance, but it is lacking an overarching API governance strategy to effectively deliver across many different APIs developed by many different teams. To help paint the tactical API governance that is already occurring let&rsquo;s zoom in on a single API being developed using an API-first approach, and consider how it is laying the foundation for a wider and more strategic approach to governance how APIs are delivered.&nbsp; Workspace - Having a dedicated repository and / or workspace for an API provides the base for delivering APIs...[<a href="/2020/08/17/getting-more-handson-talking-about-api-governance/">Read More</a>]</p>

I am doing more workshops with students recently as part of Postman student outreach, and Ken&rsquo;s class is exactly the target audience we are interested in reaching. These are young minds who are just getting started in their careers and they should be aware of APIs, how to put them to work, but more importantly making sure they are fully tested and reliable for consumers, and the applications that are built on them. Ken&rsquo;s class is all about software quality and testing, so I figured I would take a look at how APIs can be defined, versioned, managed, and tested. I&rsquo;ll be showing them the process using Postman, which is a ubiquitous tool for developers within the enterprise but the concepts I'll demonstrate are universal an something the students can apply using different tooling, using any HTTP API. Here are the building blocks of what I&rsquo;ll be walking them through, with some links to help them get primed if they have the time. API 101 - A quick refresh about what APIs are, and acknowledging they are behind every technological shift of the last 20 years. History of APIs - A quick look at how we got here, and the role that APIs play in modern software development. Introduction to Postman - Learning about how Postman can be used to make calls to web APIs without writing code.

			<p>I am working on profiling open specifications as part my work at Postman to help highlight how we can deploy APIs that use a common API and schema, reduce friction when on-boarding, while also increasing reusability across different industries. One of the open specifications on the table is from Beckn, who offers a suite of open source API specifications for things like food delivery, healthcare, and transportation--here is the description from the Beckn website describing the value they deliver. Beckn is an open protocol that enables location-aware, local commerce across industries to be discovered and engaged by any beckn-enabled application. Beckn, while being a minimal open source protocol specification, acts as a force multiplier for end-beneficiaries - customers, application developers, governments, and businesses by creating an interoperable open playground to unlock value and innovation I love to see these kinds of projects. My concern is always heldping ensure they get enough adoption to help sustain them, and contribute by helping evangelize the possibilities, which is why I am writing this post as I am working with the Beckn team to get the word out about their standard. To help push forward the conversation forward around the Beckn APIs I need Postman collections for the platform, or even better&hellip;OpenAPI definitions so that I can generate Postman collection&mdash;luckily Beckn is developing their API protocol out in the open on GitHub using OpenAPI, making my job easy.&nbsp; To help me move things forward I created a workspace in Postman dedicated to Beckn, then I took five of their OpenAPI definitions and published to the workspace, allowing me to use Postman to manage the collections and resulting docs, mocks, and eventually tests for the APIs.

			<p>I have been moving forward a number of new types of Postman API collections as part of my Union Fashion reference implementation at Postman, and one of the new types I'm using as part of different conversations are my API governance collections. I have two collections I am moving forward as a proof of concept (POC), helping map out how collections can be used to not just provide and consume APIs, but also help make sure they are more consistent in how they operate. Governance (Design) - This is just the governance of the design of the API, and since this is what most folks think of when they talk about API governance, it is the place most people should start this conversation. Governance (Lifecycle) - This is for the governance of the entire API lifecycle from start to finish, really helping me push the boundaries of what a collection is for, but also how we provide guardrails for our APIs. The API design governance collection is interesting for me, but pushing myself to think about what API governance looks like for the entire lifecycle has helped me see things differently, and has allowed me to realize that you can't govern what you don't have defined, and aren't measuring.&nbsp; Some Initial Thoughts This is all still a work in progress, so I am still working to make more self-service, and something anyone can put to use as part of their operations. Here is my brain dump of thinking going into this work, which will hopefully articulate a little more about where I am at with the work and how you can help provide feedback and thoughts on where I should go next. Why Collections? - I am skeptical that any software should bake in "governance" features into their product as governance means different things to different folks, and while we can come up with a standard set of rules that will fit most enterprise organizations,...[<a href="/2020/08/03/postman-api-governance-collections/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am having this conversation with multiple API providers right now, so I wanted to write it up, share it as part of these conversations, while also making it available for my wider audience here on API Evangelist. This is a blueprint for managing the OpenAPI and Postman collection in a very public way, ensuring the machine readable definition for an API is discoverable and easy to access, while also establishing a feedback loop for the community to participate in helping define the roadmap for each API. Leveraging both Postman and GitHub to move an API forward in a much more collaborative and observable way. Establishing a Postman Workspace ssThis blueprint begins with establishing a team workspace in Postman for managing the OpenAPI, and any collections that are derived from the OpenAPI contract, as well as environments that will be used to abstract away tokens, secrets, and other key / value pairs needed for working with the API.&nbsp; The Postman workspace will become the source of truth for your APIs, which can then be used to power other stops along the API lifecycle. You can have a single API in a workspace, or have multiple APIs, it is up to you how you want to organize your workspaces. The goal is to just make sure there is one place you can go to find your APIs, and work with other internal stakeholders on our team to move an API forward. Leveraging the workspace, but also all the comments, history, change logs and other features, helping you get more organized about how APIs are being delivered.&nbsp; Adding OpenAPI to Postman Builder With a workspace you can now add your APIs using the Postman API builder. Each API allows you to publish an OpenAPI, establishing the central truth for each of your APIs, which we can then use to generate collections for powering stops along the API lifecycle, manage change with version, the change log, and history....[<a href="/2020/08/02/managing-your-openapi-and-postman-collection-publicly/">Read More</a>]</p>

I just finished another piece on managing your OpenAPI and Postman collection publicly, laying the foundation for this post. I want these to be separate modules which people can follow and use independently, providing me with a single URL for different concepts I am discussing. While this isn&rsquo;t a a pattern everyone will want to follow, it is one possible pattern I&rsquo;ve been identifying for use by companies looking to get a handle on how APIs are being delivered across the enterprise using Postman. Building on an OpenAPI Foundation The foundation of this blueprint is all about having an OpenAPI definition within a workspace acting as the central contract for each API. Providing the cornerstone each API will need to be moved along its lifecycle, and iterated upon by all stakeholders who have access to the workspace. You can view the separate post I have on management of OpenAPI using both Postman and GitHub, but here are the moving parts of what I propose for one possible blueprint for how you want to manage your individual APIs. Workspace - Always having a dedicated workspace for each individual API or a bundle of APIs, providing a single place internal stakeholders can find whatever they need about each API to understand how it works, and influence the road map when it comes to the future iterations. Repository - Ensuring there is a GitHub repository in place to act as the partner (private) or public face of each API workspace, providing a single place that external stakeholders can can to find information on APIs, and provide feedback on each API being made available.

			<p><em>30 Jul 2020</em></p>
			<p>I am doing deep dives into each stop along the API lifecycle, beginning with deployment and management, to better understand how we can bring other features into Postman, without actually developing the features ourselves. There are two primary ways we are accomplishing this, by identifying open source solutions, and by partnering with services and tooling providers. Next up on my list is to flesh out is how we leverage the FastAPI framework as part of the Postman platform, helping developers deploy their API using the &ldquo;&nbsp;high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production&rdquo; FastAPI framework. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with FastAPI, it is one of the top open source API frameworks on Github. It is built in Python 3.6+, and based on standard Python type hints. Taken directly from the web page for FastAPI, the key features are: Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.&nbsp; Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. * Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging. Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs. Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs. Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation. Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema. I know that most Postman customers will care about all of those bullet points, but the one that really grabs my attention is the last one, and the fact that it is centered on the OpenAPI specification. As part of my OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) DemanGen efforts at Postman, and my work to flesh out different stops along the API lifecycle, I am interested in amplifying what FastAPI delivers, and work to further bake it into the Postman ecosystem.

			<p>This is a repost from the Postman community on a very slick COVID-19 data project with accompanying Postmn collection to actually work with the data and get back responses, and then view responses as a visualization using the Postman visualizer. Here is what was posted by Carson Hunter (@carrrson) from&nbsp;Metadata Technology North America (MTNA). We&rsquo;ve been hard at work building our&nbsp;Rich Data Services COVID-19 project&nbsp;4&nbsp;and are excited to finally be releasing it to the public and to have our API included in the Postman COVID-19 API Resource Center. The API includes a free-to-use and always-expanding catalog of curated COVID-19 data and metadata that&rsquo;s all set up to use with the Postman collection. (Docs are&nbsp;here&nbsp;2, or run it with the button below.) The API has a lot of great features for querying and packaging data, but maybe the coolest thing of interest to the Postman community is the ease of integration with charting libraries, so you can create visualizations quickly and easily. In this collection, we&rsquo;ve focused on using amCharts, but RDS also supports Plotly and Google Charts if that&rsquo;s your thing. By specifying one of these libraries in the request, the API returns the data in a format that&rsquo;s directly consumable by the library, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about manipulating the response. We&rsquo;ve included some visualization examples from the collection below, but the amCharts library is vast and there is a lot of COVID data out there, and we would love to see any creations the Postman community comes up with using the API. You can tweet us at&nbsp;@mtnaus. Cheers!

			<p>I am working to better understand the Moesif Analytics API so that I can define a new type of Postman collection I am calling an API management collection. You wouldn&rsquo;t use this collection to make calls to an API you operate, you would use it to automate and orchestrate the API management layer you use to operate your APIs. I am working with several API management providers, but Moesif came up in my queue of work, and I feel they represent a more progressive view of the API management landscape, so I got to work pushing this conversation forward. I recently worked to create an OpenAPI and Postman collection for the Moesif API, so that I can better understand what they offer, and now I want to learn how some of Moesif&rsquo;s customers are using their APIs, and ShipEngine was kind of enough to work with Moesif and me to help define an API management blueprint based upon how they manage their API infrastructure. ShipEngine uses both Postman and Moesif, so they provide a pretty compelling blueprint for modeling my API management collection after.&nbsp; I am looking to better understand which of the 12 Moesif resources they put to work using the Moesif API, so I can plan the next big of work on this partnership effort. Actions - Understanding the context in which actions are tracked. Applications - Understanding more about the context of an application. Cohorts - Standardize how analytics are being organized by cohort. Companies - How companies are being managed using the API. Dashboards - What sort of dashboard orchestration and automation occurs.

			<p>I am making my way through all of the partner conversation I am having, publishing stories for each of the conversations to help me move each one forward. Today I am focusing on API management providers because I am looking to define a baseline set of resources across all providers to consider for deeper integration, and of course storytelling. I&rsquo;ve been talking with the Mulesoft folks since last year, working to find some ways we can partner and provide value for both of our customers. As with every other partnership, and especially API lifecycle partners, everything begins as a collection. If I can&rsquo;t get at the APIs behind a service, create an OpenAPI and Postman collection for the API, then it isn&rsquo;t an API lifecycle capability I can think about for deeper integration, and further storytelling. But Mulesoft isn&rsquo;t messing around, and they have Swagger and RAML available for all of their API lifecycle services and tooling&nbsp; I downloaded the generated Swagger 2.0 definitions Mulesoft provides for their API manager and API platform. There are some other interesting APIs available there that I would like to see live as Postman collections. Honestly, I&rsquo;d like to see all of the APIs they have published via the Mulesoft // Dev catalog in the Postman API network, as well as Postman collection added to the dropdown list Mulesoft provides for each API, allowing it&rsquo;s definition to be downloaded as RAML, Swagger, or Postman Collection. As with the other API management service providers I am profiling as part of this work, I created a Postman workspace for managing Mulesoft APIs. With the Swagger 2.0 and Postman collections for the Mulesoft API Manager and API Platform I can begin to break down the individual capabilities that the API management solution provides. Then I can pick from the most common of these API management building blocks and get to work developing some collections that help API providers automate and orchestrate the...[<a href="/2020/07/29/producing-a-postman-collection-for-mulesoft-api-manager-and-platform/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am working my way through profiling API analytics provider Moesif. I have a pile of partner related work accumulating and there is no better way to work through what is going on than just writing here on API Evangelist&mdash;it is what this blog is all about. I am interested in Moesif because they are a next generation API management provider that represents the ever expanding universe of what we need to manage our APIs at scale. With the consolidation and commodification of API management since 2015, we&rsquo;ve seen more specialized API service providers emerge like Moesif who are focused on just one aspect of management&mdash;like analytics. My review of any API service provider always begins with looking at their own developer area, and identifying whether or not they have an API (all API service providers should have APIs)&mdash;Moesif has one. Next, I need a machine readable API definition&mdash;either an OpenAPI or Postman, ideally both, as they have varied but overlapping purposes. Moesif is using Postman, which I will talk about more in a bit, but alas there wasn&rsquo;t an easy OpenAPI or Postman collection for me to put to work (shame shame). Luckily they use Slate for their docs, which always means there is some easy to scrape and parse markdown or HTML right behind things. I quickly generated an OpenAPI for the Moesif API analytics API. It isn&rsquo;t a complete OpenAPI, but it does give me the paths, summaries, and parameters in a machine readable format. I can use this to generate a Postman collection, then begin using it to certify each of the endpoints, saving examples, and making for a more robust definition for docs, mocks, testing, and other lifecycle stops. To continue working with my Moesif OpenAPI definition I will need to create a dedicated workspace in Postman for my work with this partner, and publish the OpenAPI in my Postman API Builder. With the entry level OpenAPI in Postman, I...[<a href="/2020/07/29/developing-a-reference-openapi-and-collection-for-the-moesif-analytics-api-so-that-i-can-build-an-api-management-collection/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Jul 2020</em></p>
			<p>I am profiling a number of API management APIs right now and reaching out to each of their teams to discuss moving forward a set of official API management collections that I can have published to the API network, and use to flesh out more API lifecycle capabilities within the Postman platform. Postman isn&rsquo;t an API management service provider, so it make sense for us to expose existing API management and gateway solutions as integrations, rather than attempt to build anything on our own, partnering with the best of breed API management solutions already in use. This will be our approach to other stops along the API lifecycle, weighing the possibilities with each stop, based upon what already exists in the space, and what the opportunities are for us to build, partner, or a mix of both. Next up on my list of API service providers is to profile and assess as part of this work is WSO2. I&rsquo;ve worked with WSO2 since way back in 2012, so I am somewhat familiar with their product and services. As with all of the other API management providers I am profiling I am looking for an existing OpenAPI or Postman collection to help me understand what is possible with each API. It was pretty easy to find the Swagger file for each of the WSO2 publisher, store, and administrative APIs, but I couldn&rsquo;t easily find them for their tokens or analytics API, or their Microgateway&mdash;I will ping them to see if they have Swagger for these. I was able to upload three Swagger 2.0 definitions into a Postman workspace&mdash;I normally would upgrade to OpenAPI 3.0, but since these were provider managed specs I will keep them as is, in case I need to update. There are a wealth of resources available across these three WSO2 API, and having them available as Swagger definitions, and generated Postman collections helps me make sense of what is possible. This provides...[<a href="/2020/07/29/breaking-down-the-capabilities-of-the-wso2-api-manager/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Jul 2020</em></p>
			<p>It can be difficult to understand exactly what OpenAPI is and what it isn&rsquo;t sometimes. I get a lot of questions from folks who don&rsquo;t entirely grasp what the OpenAPI specification is, and how it applies to the API lifecycle. It is alright to not fully get all the technical details of the specification, and I want to acknowledge this deficiency in the space, and help address the challenges by holding a 30 minute open office hours where I will introduce what OpenAPI is each week--helping on-board new people to the world of OpenAPI. These discussions will start out pretty free form, with me developing some curriculum to help introduce folks to the spec, but is something I would refine each week based upon the questions I get from the public. I am looking to begin with just walking through some of the most common elements of OpenAPI 3.1, helping lay the foundation for what OpenAPI is all about:s History - Quick recap of how we got here, including the difference between Swagger and OpenAPI. Purpose - A look at what OpenAPI is for and why it has become a standard for defining APIs. Objects - Walking through the core objects that are present as part of the OpenAPI spec. YAML / JSON - Talking about how you can use YAML or JSOn to define your OpenAPIs. Services - Looking at some of the services that have adopted the OpenAPI spec as standard. Tooling - Looking at some of the open source tooling that have embraced the OpenApI spec. I think that is all I will have time for when it comes to the 30 minutes. Initially I&rsquo;d like to just run through the basics of OpenAPI, and I can do 30 minutes sessions dedicated to other sections in future office hours. Right now I am looking to just talk about the basics, formalize some basic content, and answer the questions of folks looking to...[<a href="/2020/07/22/openapi-101-intro-to-openapi-open-office-hours-each-friday/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Jul 2020</em></p>
			<p>OpenAPI has been around for five years now. There really is no reason for so many folks are still talking about Swagger 2.0, when there are more benefits associated with the OpenAPI 3.0 specification, and more modern services and tooling that utilizes the current version of the API specification. I want to open up a conversation about this, discuss the challenges that people face, and help folks understand what the difference is between Swagger and OpenAPI, and why they should be moving forward, and not staying in the past. This recurring session will start out exploring the divide and misconception that exists, and then evolve to be more formal about what enterprise organizations are needing to migrate: History - Quick recap of how we got here, including the difference between Swagger and OpenAPI. Differences - What are the key differences between Swagger 2.0 and OpenAPI 3.0.  Services - Look at how API services providers are using each of the specifications. Tooling - Understand the diff between tooling in both areas, understanding where deficiencies are. Storytelling - How can we tell more stories about OpenAPI that help people understand the difference. The goal here is to develop some basic curriculum that helps teams make the switch from Swagger to OpenAPI. Part of this will be to understand how to help get the word out about the difference and why it matters that we move forward. There is a number of misconceptions that exist the prevent folks from moving forward, and I am looking to help clear things up, get people focusing on the future of the specification, and shift the conversation to services and tooling around OpenAPI 3.0. This is just one of a handful of office hours I am looking to hold to facilitate discussions about OpenAPI. I am trying to help increase the awareness and demand for OpenAPI, and help push the community forward.

			<p><em>21 Jul 2020</em></p>
			<p>One of the areas I am working on defining at Postman is how we partner with API providers, and API service providers. We are doing a lot of partnering right now, but we do not have a formal program for how we engage with our partners. Over the last couple of months I have been working to identify who all of our partners are, and define the common ways we partner with these various companies, non-profit organizations, institutions, and government agencies. I have a lot of people reaching out about partnering, and there are a lot of interesting APIs, services, and tooling providers I am looking to partner with, so we will need to get a little more formal about things if we are going to take things to the next level. One of the most obvious ways I can encourage folks to partner with Postman is to publish a collection for their API to the Postman public API network. Once Postman formalizes its partner strategy, this will become the lowest tier of partnership for the platform and community, providing a self-service way to engage with us (pssst! you don't have to wait). If you aren&rsquo;t familiar, the Postman network is a public directory of APIs. To join all you have to do is click n the dropdown menu for each of your API collections, and choose to publish as docs. &nbsp;As part of the process you are given the option to publish as part of the Postman API network&mdash;making your collection available on the web, and within the Postman desktop client. There are a bunch of settings as part of publishing documentation using Postman, and the collection discovery portion of the settings will allow you to control how things are published (or not). Once you hit publish the documentation and run in Postman button for your collection will show up under your user or team page, which is something you can repeat over and...[<a href="/2020/07/21/the-quickest-way-to-partner-with-postman-is-through-the-network/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Jul 2020</em></p>
			<p>I am working my way through all of the partner work I have on my workbench, and there is no better way to work through it than to write it out as blog posts here on API Evangelist. I just talked about how the easiest way to partner with Postman is by adding your collections to the API network. This is no guarantee of partnership, because Postman doesn&rsquo;t have a formal partner program yet, but it is a quick way to get on the Postman community radar, and if your API and collection is interesting enough, we are likely to want to showcase more in other storytelling. Adding your collection to the Postman network is self-service and easy to do, you don&rsquo;t need to talk with Postman to do it, but there is also another way in which you can partner with Postman that is also self-service, and will also get our attention. You can bake collections into your platform, which we like to call &ldquo;runtime integrations&rdquo;, because API service providers are integrating the Postman runtime into their services, and adopting the Postman collection schema as a common way to define API requests and workflows on their platform. An example of a Postman runtime integration can be found with API monitoring provider APIMetrics, who allows their customers to import a Postman collection and fire up industrial grade API monitoring at scale. Postman does monitoring, but it makes sense to embrace other service providers who offer competing or more comprehensive services, and a Postman collection is the perfect unit of currency to define this relationship. APIMetrics benefits from the over 11 million users of Postman, and Postman benefits because our customers can scale the services they use with Postman, and with all of our partners. Beyond APIMetrics, here are a handful of other service providers who have baked the Postman collection into their platforms.

			<p>I recently harvested all of the open source tooling that is being built on the OpenAPI and Swagger specifications from GitHub. I am looking to better understand what people are doing with the specification, and parsing the words people use to describe their open source project is a good way for me to quickly pull together a list of what matters. If people are building a tool to solve a problem, and publish that on GitHub, it is a good sign that it is an itch needing scratching--here is the tag cloud from this list of what people are doing with both Swagger and OpenAPI.

Semantically they all don&rsquo;t jive, but it does paint an interesting picture of what is happening in the OpenAPI community. I am going to be working on this list to establish a more solid reference for the OpenAPI community. I am looking to profile all of these tools as part of the OAI demand generation work I am doing, but I am also interested in continuing to map the API lifecycle and keep mapping how open source OpenAPI tooling fits into the picture. We have built up a lot of momentum over the years, but this landscape is still pretty fractured and disorganized, making it difficult to navigate&mdash;I am looking to change that.[<a href="/2020/07/20/what-are-people-doing-with-swagger-and-openapi/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I conducted the first OAI Demand Generation Public Office Hours last Friday. On behalf of the OAI I am looking to generate more awareness and demand around the specification, helping bring together members and non-members in the community to tell more stories about what is happening around the specification. I pitched the idea as part of the OAI marketing meeting, and didn&rsquo;t want to waste any time in scheduling a meeting and getting the conversation going. We had a pretty small turnout for the first one, resulting me just talking about what I am already working on for over a half hour. However, we now have over 20 people added to the invite for the recurring meeting every Friday at 8:00 AM Pacific Time. Here are a few ways you can catch up on what is going on, and get involved: Head Over to GitHub - We are managing this effort out in the open on GitHub, using the README as a home page, and issues to help track ideas and projects that are moving forward. View Last Weeks Video - I am recording each session and publishing to YouTube for those who can&rsquo;t make it. This one isn&rsquo;t the highest quality, but I will get better at doing these in the future. Join the Conversation - Go ahead and email info@apievangelist.com if you&rsquo;d like to be added to the Google Calendar invite for the OAI DemandGen Public Office Hours, and get the meeting in your calendar. We are looking to gather ideas from across the community about how we can build awareness of the OpenAPI specification, and increase more demand for the services and tooling that is built on top of it. I am aggregating ideas via the issue for the projects GitHub repository, and moving forward projects as I have time.

			<p><em>20 Jul 2020</em></p>
			<p>I like researching and thinking more about each of&nbsp;the 13 AsyncAPI protocol bindings. It paints a picture of the past, present, and future of APIs for me. Leveraging AsyncAPI to define your event and message driven APIs is the future of API development, but one of the things I really, really, really, love about AsyncAPI as a specification is that the definition for the HTTP binding is just OpenAPI. Similar to how OpenAPI and AsyncAPI have baked in JSON Schema, AsyncAPI has baked in OpenAPI. In my opinion, this is how API specifications should work. There shouldn&rsquo;t be one specification to rule them all, we let API specs compete on usefulness and the tooling that is built on top, and build on top of the specifications that already exist, preventing us from reinventing the wheel.&nbsp; This kind of extensibility and reuse is what APIs are all about. This isn&rsquo;t a question of OpenAPI vs. AsyncAPI, it is a question of AsyncAPI and OpenAPI. I know there is a lot of investment going into thinking about OpenAPI overlays for the next version, but as we have these thoughts I want to make sure this type of reuse gets considered. I am thinking very deeply about OpenAPI again, but I also find myself thinking very deeply about a number of API, data, and other operational level API specifications, and how they all work in concert. I am also thinking about where we need potentially new specifications, industry level specifications, and trying to find the bandwidth to continue talking about the future of APIs.json providing an index for all of API operations. OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Postman collections have come a long way over the years, and I feel pretty poised to radically move forward how the API factory floor operates within the enterprise. I learned a lot about the technology, business, and politics of APIs by participating in the evolution of API specs from 2010 through...[<a href="/2020/07/20/openapi-is-the-http-binding-in-asyncapi/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>14 Jul 2020</em></p>
			<p>I am making my rounds with folks in the API community talking about the next generation of the OpenAPI specification, getting people to move beyond Swagger 2.0, tooling and service providers to adopt more of the spec, and generate more demand for the specification and the work going on around it. Demand generation is such a business term to describe what I envision, but it is a word that people in the sector get, and neatly sums up what we need to do, so to hell with it. The OpenAPI spec has continued to evolve and grow, but things have clearly plateaued when it comes to the narrative coming out of the OAI, and from people doing interesting things with the specification in the API space. There is lots of activity, but there isn&rsquo;t a clear overarching narrative about what is OpenAPI, why OpenAPI, and the tooling and service enablement that is occurring around it. I am looking to change this, gather ideas, turn up the volume, and get more people working with OpenAPI 3.1, and investing in the future of the spec. To help drive the demand generation discussion around OpenAPI I am going to be holding a recurring weekly demand generation discussion right after the regular OAI marketing meeting&mdash;here are the details if you want to join in the conversation. OpenAPI Demand Generation weekly at 11:00 AM Pacific Time&nbsp;on Google Meet&nbsp;- Let me know if you want a calendar invite to join in each week. While the meeting is associated with the OAI you do not have to be a member to participate. We are looking to gather ideas from the community about what we should be doing to generate more demand for the OpenAPI specification. I have been gathering ideas from one on one discussions with folks, so if you have any ideas and won&rsquo;t be able to join in, feel free to email me or schedule some time to talk.

			<p><em>13 Jul 2020</em></p>
			<p>I started planning API Evangelist in July of 2010 after I saw what was happening with APIs being used in the cloud, and powering mobile applications. By September I had a plan in place, and I figured out a name, bought a domain, and had established my approach to researching what was going on with web APIs. Ten years later I am still doing the work, and even though I&rsquo;ve managed to burn out a couple of times, have had life get I&rsquo;m the way, and more recently joined Postman as their Chief Evangelist, I am still beating the drum after all these years. I have learned a lot over the last decade. I don&rsquo;t see APIs as good, nor bad, nor neutral anymore&mdash;they are as good or bad as whoever is wielding them, which with the lax security and ethics of most companies, it isn't always the API provider inflicting the most damage to the ecosystem. APIs leave me very concerned most days. I am not very keen on building and owning production APIs in the current online world, but I am happy to stay in tune with how the machine works, help evangelize for some ethics and sanity in how we use them, and hopefully be somewhat of a voice of reason in the space, even if I am still doing a significant amount of selling of the concept, and perpetuating of the myths.&nbsp; The Only Thing That Has Changed Is That There Are More APIs There really hasn&rsquo;t been any seismic shifts in the API landscape during my 10 years of studying what is going on. 80% of what occurs across the API lifecycle was going on in 2010. There are just more people doing it. Sure, there are a few new tricks and tools, but for the most part the APIs in 2020 are just like they were in 2010, it is just more mainstream companies doing them now, as well...[<a href="/2020/07/13/i-started-api-evangelist-10-years-ago/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Jun 2020</em></p>
			<p>I am speaking tomorrow at 1PM Pacific time about using Postman collections and environments to define and power the API lifecycle at apidays INTERFACE. I am stoked that I get to have a dream job where I get paid to push forward ideas at this level, and wanted to share some of the ways I am using OpenAPI in conjunction with Postman collections and environments to define then execute across the API lifecycle for a variety of APIs. My talk is going to walk through the relationship between an OpenAPI and collections, but also begin pushing forward the notion of what collections are for, while also demonstrating that environments can be used for much more than just a place to put your API tokens and keys. Most developers know that you can use a Postman collection to store the details of an API you want to make requests to, helping you keep track of the all the details of each request and response. Developers have tons of these collections laying around, sometimes organized by personal and team workspaces. Developers are also using Postman environments to abstract away keys, tokens, and other key / values pairs that can be used across one or many collections. What most developers do not know is that you can use collections and environments to also deploy and manage your API across multiple stops along the API lifecycle, while also using them to measure and govern what is going with each API as it moves forward across a standardized API life cycle. My talk at APIdays INTERFACE is focused on this evolution in how Postman collections and environments can be applied to not just defining APIs, but also defining the API lifecycle. API Lifecycle Foundation To help ground each API I am developing I establish a strong foundation for moving each API forward, providing me with a layer I can use for delivering every other stop along the API lifecycle, consistently...[<a href="/2020/06/29/i-am-speaking-about-powering-the-api-lifecycle-with-collections-environments-tomorrow-at-apidaysglobal-interface/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>My head is swirling from a flurry of exciting meetings around what different Postman features are being worked on currently. I can&rsquo;t speak directly on the features until they are released, but I am keen on pushing forward my understanding of the stops along the API lifecycle being served so that I can be articulate in meetings, while also helping light the fire under my readers imagination about what is possible with APIs. Today my head is moving very rapidly across the types of APIs I am producing or seeing produced, as well as the variety of approaches employed to bring these APIs to life&mdash;spanning from simple mocking of an API to full blow deployment of APIs at scale across multiple platforms, frameworks, and languages. I am thinking the overlap between examples I used in my APIs, how I mock with these examples, then evolve them into more static, synthetic, and dynamic mock implementations, or even possibly how these APIs then become real world production deployments. Currently you can mock your APIs with a variety of services, including Postman. I have also played around with a variety of ways to deploy APIs from an OpenAPI using Postman. I am looking for ways to help better quantify, visualize, and understand the different types of data we are making available via APIs, how those APIs are defined, hardened, and scaled, as well as documented and immediately accessible via a client like Postman.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have the first clue in how to map this out as a single visualization or coherent narrative, but that won&rsquo;t stop me from trying. Here are the dimensions I am working within, trying to define some sort of Venn diagram regarding how they work in concert. I can&rsquo;t quite see it all yet, but this post is designed to help me bring it more into focus. I am trying to put these in order of need, but it is very difficult when they...[<a href="/2020/06/24/api-examples-schema-mocks-static-synthetic-dynamic-data-functions-frameworks-gateway-deployment-documentation-and-client/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>12 Jun 2020</em></p>
			<p>I spent the last week looking through open source tooling built around leading API specifications. If you are tuned into the RSS or Twitter feed from this blog you probably saw the exhaust from my research. People who don&rsquo;t understand what API Evangelist is about often see these as listicle posts, and are confused by my erratic scheduling and release of these posts. If you understand that API Evangelist isn&rsquo;t a tech blog in the normal sense, and that it is my professional API workbench, then you understand I am often times working towards some sort of research goal with each post. Well, this post is the next step in that research, taking me 12 separate research sprints to look through the API specification layer of our industry.&nbsp; I am very interested in the top open source tools developed on top of these API specifications. However, I am also very interested in understanding how each of these tools contribute value to different stops along the API life cycle. These are the essential building blocks I identify to help me understand what people on the ground within organizations are needing when it comes to delivering APIs. Resulting in a pretty interesting list of capabilities, which are ordered based upon the frequency they are mentioned across all to the tooling for each of these dimensions. The results of this research is all pulled from GitHub, so I recognize it is an incomplete snapshot, but I still see it as the most representative source we have from across the API industry of how people are investing across the API life cycle.&nbsp; Postman&nbsp;(See Open Source Tools) Collections, Testing, Data, Repos, Run,&nbsp; CRUD, CLI , Client, Database.
