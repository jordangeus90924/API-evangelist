			<p><em>03 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>
As I continue to evovle my service composition definition, using my 3Scale API infrastructure, across my microservices stack, the thought of public vs private doesn&rsquo;t even enter the equation. I am doing my APIs using the Internet pipes, so they are public by default&mdash;then using my service composition I define the layer that actually regulates what is openly accessible by the public, what resources have limited access, and specifically how much of any resource any single person can access.
When I&rsquo;m working through my API Stack, the concept of public and private doesn't exist. This is a reality that plays out in conversations between people who don&rsquo;t fully understand the world of API management&mdash;aka the tech blogosphere. If it has an http:// in front of the address, it is a public API&mdash;sorry. You need to secure it like it is public, and you need to approach service composition in a sensible way, that deals with identity, and access management across all your public infrastructure.
As we move towards a world where the Internet isn&rsquo;t just on our desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile environments, it is everywhere in our homes, business, cars, and public space, there will be no separation between public and private API resources. Everything will be public, it will just be a matter of properly defining who has access, exactly how much they can consume, and in what way they can actually engage with the valuable API driven resources emerging all around us.
Update: This conversation seems to have generated some buzz, and here are some of the responses:

			<p><em>03 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time reading API related patents&nbsp;lately. I downloaded all of the patent applications between 2005 and 2015, filtered for all patents that mention &ldquo;application programming interface&rdquo; in the title, abstract, or description of the API, resulting in a database of 16,485 patents. Currently I&rsquo;m reading the 700+ that just mention API in title or abstract, and once done I&rsquo;ll take a look at the rest. First, let me state that patents are not a concept I subscribe to. Personally, I do not believe in defining, and locking up ideas, but I do not live in the world I&rsquo;d like, and after beginning my patent API search, I see patents are a concept that like API copyright, will be increasingly wielded across many industries where APIs are being put to use. For this reason, I engage in my research, and overall patent awareness journey, not because I&rsquo;m a believer in the patent system, or am looking to submit any patents--I want to better understand how patents are being used to define API processes, and help see the evolving role APIs are playing in the larger patent story over the last 20 years. First, What Exactly Is An API Patent? There are many incarnations of API, and making sense of whether a patent directly describes a specific API, or is more API adjacent can be very difficult to do. I&rsquo;m operating under the assumption that if &ldquo;application programming Interface&rdquo; is present in title or abstract, it is likely that the patent describes an API fueled process, and my initial review of the 700+ patents support this. This realization moved the conversation in my head from &ldquo;will patents affect APIs&rdquo; to &ldquo;APIs are being patented&rdquo;, and we need to better understand what is going on, regardless of the precise definition of what an API is. Whether an API is more hardware related, system or specifically a web API as we know it today, becomes...[<a href="/2015/02/03/apis-are-establishing-new-and-useful-processes-faster-than-patents-can-keep-pace-with/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>03 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>The release of the the president's fiscal year 2016 budget in a machine readable format on Github was one of the most important things to come out of Washington D.C. in a while when it comes to open data and APIs. I was optimistic when the president mandated that all federal agencies need to go machine readable by default, but the release of the annual budget in this way is an important sign that the White House is following its own open data rhetoric, and something every agency should emulate. There is still a lot of work to be done to make sense of the federal budget, but having it published in a machine readable format on Github saves a lot of time, and energy in this process. As soon as I landed on the Github repository, clicked into the data folder, and saw the three CSV files, I got to work converting them to JSON format. Having the budget available in CSV is a huge step beyond the historic PDFs we&rsquo;ve had to process in the past, to get at the budget numbers, but having it in JSON by default, would be even better. What now? Well, I would like to make more sense of the budget, and to be able to slice and dice it in different ways, I&rsquo;m going to need an API. Using a Swagger definition, I generated a simple server framework using Slim &amp; PHP, with an endpoint for each file, budauth, outlays, and receipts. Now I just need to add some searching, filtering, paging, and other essential functionality, and it will be ready for public consumption--then I can get to work slicing and dicing the budget, and previous years budgets in different ways. I already have my eye on a couple D3.js visualizations to help me make sense of the budget. First I want to be able to show the scope of budget for different areas of government, to...[<a href="/2015/02/03/a-machine-readable-version-of-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2016-budget-on-github/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>I was having a Twitter conversation with John Sheehan(@johnsheehan) about the easiest way to generate interactive API documentation this weekend, without getting all tangled up in having to get into the weeds of Swagger UI. I love me some Swagger UI, something I think has transformed how we engage with APIs, but the JavaScript for it can be inaccessible, and difficult to customize--to say the least. There are other UI solutions to API documentation, projects like Slate from Tripit, from Readme.io, and some cool UI stuff over at OpenFDA, but really I haven&rsquo;t seen much evolution beyond Swagger UI. Sure, Apiary.io has a great UI, but it isn&rsquo;t the portable, customizable vision I have in my head (they are working on this, BTW). I envision a whole gallery of simple, UI templates that you can choose from, driven by machine readable Swagger or API Blueprint API definitions. Looks like the gov hackers over at 18F feel the same way, and are working on something like this&mdash;"a suite of tools and templates that faciliate the generation of static, human-readable documentation to replace SwaggerUI&rdquo;. Shawn Allen, has created two repos: swagger-template, just some HTML files that should theoretically be useful for generating static HTML documentation for a Swagger-compliant API. swagger-enhance, a little Node utility for grabbing a Swagger API's JSON and "enhancing" it with JSON data from each of its own endpoints (confusingly, "apis", in Swagger parlance). It makes me happy to see some brainstorming to push the conversation forward. I&rsquo;m able to deploy Swagger UI pretty quickly to support my APIs, using Github Pages, but when it comes to extending, and transforming the UI, I hit a wall pretty quickly. I've created some custom UI solutions, to help me manage my own infrastructure, driven by Swagger, but nothing that contributes to the larger conversation. I&rsquo;d love to see API design, deployment, and integration tools I depend on like Restlet Studio, and Postman provide more support for...[<a href="/2015/02/02/we-need-better-api-documentation-and-ui-deployment-options/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>
As I work to redefine my world using microservices, I have this sudden realization how important my API management infrastructure is to all of this. Each one of my microservices are little APIs that do one thing, and do it well, relying on my API management infrastructure to know who should be accessing, and exactly how much of the resource they should have access to.
My note API shouldn&rsquo;t have to know anything about my users, it is just trained to ask my API management infrastructure, if each user has proper credentials to accessing the resource, and what the service composition will allow them to do with it (aka read, write, how much, etc.) My note API does what it does best, store notes, and relies on my API management layer to do what it does best--manage access to the microservice.
This approach to API management has llowed me to deploy any number of microservices, using my API management infrastructure to compose my various service packages&mdash;this is called service composition. I employ 3Scale infrastructure for all my API / microservice management, which I use to define different service tiers like retail, wholesale, internal, and other service specific groupings. When users sign up for API access, I add them to one of the service tiers, and my API service composition layer handles the rest.
Modern API management service composition is the magic hand-waiving in my microservice orchestration, and without it, it would be much more work for me to compose using microservices in this containerized API world that is unfolding.
Disclosure: 3Scale is an API Evangelist partner.

			<h3><a href="/2015/02/02/api-evangelist-logomaker/">API Evangelist Logomaker</a></h3>
			<p><em>02 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>
In 2010, when I started API Evangelist, I sat down to create a logo, and after six hours of frustration in photoshop, I eventually just typed out my logo as a basic JSON representation, kind of as a joke, which I eventually planned on changing, but it stuck.
With the latest batch of t-shirts I've ditched the "logo" portion, but will keep this legacy version floating around, here and there for nostalgic purposes. Along the way, I've added what I consider the function version of the logo, which I use for each of my research sites.
I'm starting so many new research areas lately, I decided to create a logomaker API, so I can make new logos, and anyone else can make their own as well. There are three API endpoints for the API Evangelist logomaker API:

Single -&nbsp;http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/single/?value=[value]
Key/Value -&nbsp;http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/keyvalue/?key=[key]&amp;value=[value]
Function -&nbsp;http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/function/?name=[name]

The API is completely open, but I will be cleaning out the images each day, so if you truly want to keep one, save it locally. Have fun playing. I will actually be using it to generate headers for my research sites. If you want to use any of my logos, make sure you follow my branding guidelines. ;-)

			<p><em>31 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>I went up to&nbsp;California State University Channel Islands the other day to talk APIs with their tech team, and I was happy to find at least one strong API skeptic on the team. API skeptics also give me material for stories, so I thoroughly enjoy coming across them, and telling these stories is how keep polishing my argument for the next API skeptic encounter at campus IT, at the higher educational institutions that I visit. During the discussion I was posed several interesting questions, and one of them was: why would you ever give students API access to the Student Information System (SIS), and let them build un-sanctioned apps that we will end up have to support? Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) FERPA gives students the right to review, control disclosure, and request amendment of their education record. Increasingly this is going beyond just via a web interface, PDF, or printed copies. President Barack Obama mandated that all federal agencies begin providing information in machine readable formats, and many cities and states are putting it into law as well. A student should always have access to their data, and they should be able to choose to do this via campus applications, or be able to obtain a portable copy of their record for storage in a location of their choosing, or possible use within a 3rd party system of their choice&mdash;it's their data. Period. Un-Sanctioned App Concern Is Just A Red HerringModern API management infrastructure like 3Scale, and&nbsp;WSO2, provide an unprecedented level of control over managing API access, requiring secure on-boarding of new developers, the establishment of service composition definitions, which provides rich real-time analytics on how APIs are used, and by whom&mdash;while also seamlessly integrating with existing identity and access management solutions. The university gets to choose who has access to which services, revoke access when abused, while also better understanding how resources are really being accessed and put to use.

API skeptics also give me material for stories, so I thoroughly enjoy coming across them, and telling these stories is how keep polishing my argument for the next API skeptic encounter at campus IT, at the higher educational institutions that I visit. During the discussion I was asked several interesting questions, the first one was: why would you want to list of your web services (APIs) for your public university, out in the open, via a central portal?? What a security risk!! Sorry, But Security Through Obscurity Is Not A Strategy I&rsquo;m sorry, hiding things, and hoping nobody finds them is not a valid IT strategy. You are a public university, and you should have a sophisticated identity and access management, as well as well tight approach to security. If you can&rsquo;t properly secure an API resource available at a public URL, you shouldn&rsquo;t be running campus IT, sorry. You should be able to provide a public description, of what resources are available, without giving away the farm. The Feeling You Have &mdash;It Comes From Legacy Power And Control As an IT professional, if you don&rsquo;t acknowledge that power and control exists within classic IT processes, you are in denial. I&rsquo;ve taken over numerous company IT operations, and there is ALWAYS political struggles between IT and the rest of operations. If you list all digital resources in a single portal, and make them available in a self-service way, it disrupts existing power and control structures. When you make things hard to find, you play a central role in people finding these resources, and you are in power&mdash;adding to decades of legacy stories about IT being a negative force in operations.

			<p><em>31 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>The quantified-self API Fitbit recently added an APIs.json for their domain. Their usage of APIs.json is a perfect, dead-simple, introductory example of how APIs can start putting APIs.json for their API platform. To help other providers understand, I wanted to take a look at the moving parts of Fitbits APIs.json, and to assist the conversation I labeled each part. A) The heart of an APIs.json, providing a name, description, image, and tags for API platform and collection. B) The technical details of where this APIs.json came from, which version it is, and when it was created and last modified. C) Similar to the overall APIs.json collection, each API gets a name, description, image, and tags, but also as the default URL people should go to find the API, as well as the base URL actually make calls to the AP, which is used as the API identifier. D) Properties collection for the API. This is where the flexibility in the APIs.json comes in, and you can define any type of URL you wish. Ideally we establish a core set of machine readable properties, but providing human links to blog, documentation, etc are essential too. E) X-blog - a link to the Fitbit blog, providing a direct link that users can use to read the blog. F) X-blog-rss-feed -a link to the RSS feed, providing a machine readable link to stories, and updates for the platform. G) X-github - a link to the official Github account for the Fitbit platform, when you consider the Github API, this becomes a machine readable link to multiple aspects of API operations. H) X-twitter - a link to the official Twitter account for the Fitbit platform, which again, using the Twitter API, this becomes a machine readable resources for accessing platform communications, updates, and resources. I) Contact information for the Fitbit API team, which they route you to a forum.

			<p><em>31 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>I started doing research on API patents recently, and after about 5 days of processing XML files from the US Patent Office, I'm going to stop processing at the year 2004 (way back). This gives me 2005 through present day, and provides more than enough information for me to evaluate the role APIs are playing in the patent process, and inversely how patents are affecting the API space. In 2004, the XML data files I'm processing start to change, and I'm getting errors, resulting in me having to reconfigure my script, in addition to downloading the numerous, large XML files. I think I have enough of a sampling to start building a wider awareness of what is going on with patents and APIs, I can always come back and download 1995 through 2004. So far, I have found 16,485 patent applications that had the phrase "application programming interface" in either the title, abstract, or full description for the patent. I found 151 patents that specifically mentioned API in the patent title, and 569 that specifically said it in the abstract. Here is the breakdown by year: 2015 - 105 2014 - 322 2013 - 973 2012 - 2563 2011 - 2809 2010 - 2513 2009 - 1705 2008 - 1636 2007 - 1391 2006 - 1434 2005 - 978 I'm going to continue my API patent journey by reading the 151 patents that specifically mentioned API in the patent title, and the 569 that specifically said it in the abstract. From there, I will expand into the other patent applications and try to understand if the API is more hardware API, or more API adjacent.&nbsp; I have a lot of learning ahead, so I don't want to make to many assumptions early on, but looking at the list of companies who have filed patents, it becomes very clear to me that if you want to conduct business in the API economy, you are going to...[<a href="/2015/01/31/api-patents-2005-through-2015/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I'm using APIs.json to organize my swagger defined microservices running in docker containers, and using the machine readable API index to drive navigation between microservices organized in a single collection. APIs.json provides a simple, machine readable way to index the technology, business, and political elements of each microservice I deploy.
As I was auditing the 18+ microservices I&rsquo;ve setup for my core operations, I wanted to audit each one, and make sure I had included various elements in each APIs definition, like where developers can onboard, terms of service, and where to find related code samples. To accomplish this, I was able to just compare each microservice APIs.json, with a master APIs.json template I had established while planning my original microservice stack.&nbsp;
Sometimes it is just as important to know what is missing, right alongside what is available for all of my microservices, and APIs.json is proving to be a simple way of understanding this layer of my API operation at scale.

			<p><em>30 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I spent the day yesterday up in Camarillo, at California State University Channel Islands (CI). Half my time I spent speaking with a mix of folks from the campus tech team about APIs, and the other half I spent learning about video production at the university. I wanted to thank , Chris Mattia (@cmmattia) Director of Academic Technology, CSU Channel Islands, Michael Berman (@amichaelberman) VP Technology &amp; Communication, California State University Channel, Mikhail Gershovich (@mgershovich) for having me up.
The conversation I had with their tech team around APIs reflected other conversations I&rsquo;ve been having with other higher educational institutions. It was a mix of business and technical talent from the school, ranging from instructional technologists, to front-end, and backend data people. The spectrum of personalities range from the API literate, to API curious, and of course the API skeptic&mdash;which demonstrates their is a healthy balance to the tech team the university, in my opinion.
I walked everyone through the history of APIs, and showcased a couple of the other universities putting APIs to work, then I just opened up the conversation to the technology, business, and politics of APIs on campus. The leadership at Channel Islands can see the potential of APIs, but just like every other sensible institution, they have to cautiously evaluate where the low hanging fruit is, get some small API wins, before tackling any larger API projects.
These types of conversations are something I will be encouraging more of in 2015, and I&rsquo;m looking to bring together the 10 institutions I&rsquo;ve had discussions with so far together for an API event, while also opening up invitation other institutions who might want to participate. If you would like to jump start an API discussion at your higher education institution, please let me know.

			<p><em>30 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>
APITools is a simple, open source, API middleware that allows you to &ldquo;track, transform and analyze the traffic between your app and the APIs&rdquo;. With just a few clicks you can proxy any API you use, and when you make calls through the proxy, you get a bunch of valuable  information in return.
One thing APITools does, that is extremely valuable to me, is it generates Swagger definitions, mapping out the surface area of an API, with each call I make. These API definitions have a wide variety of uses for me, ranging from better understanding the API designs of popular services, to providing API search services through open API search engines like APIs.io.
If you are regularly developing against a public API, can you take a moment to swap the baseURL with one created in APITools, make all of your calls to the API, then send me a copy of the Swagger definition? I would sure appreciate the help in creating Swagger definitions for all of the popular APIs available today. Don&rsquo;t worry all your work is openly available on both APIs.io, and&nbsp;API Stack for re-use and forking by anyone.

			<p><em>30 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I was struggling with exactly how much API surface area can exist for a service before it stops being micro&nbsp;the other day, and while I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever find a precise measurement for this, I&rsquo;d like to have a fluid definition that I can use to automatically evaluate, how big an API is.
So, what data can I gather, to help me quantify the surface area of my API? I&rsquo;ll start with each endpoints, then count each verb, parameter, and potential response. Since I use Swagger for all of my API definitions, I can easily do this, and I can also understand each API response better because also I have them linked to the underlying data model.
I&rsquo;m not exactly sure how this surface area definition will work, ultimately I&rsquo;d like to be able to separate verbose APIs by different layers, like the number of endpoints or parameters, or maybe the lack of verbs, or responses (not what is there, but what is missing)--I'm not sure. I&rsquo;m just getting going with my API surface area map.
My goal is to be able to list 20-30 microservices, and generate a basic visualization showing the approximate scope. Then I can use this in my decision making around whether or not I add features to an existing service, or spin it out as an entirely new service.

			<p><em>28 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m fascinated by the rise of Twitter bots. Little automated bundles of social media joy, built to spew mostly nonsense, but everyone once in a while you find nuggets of wisdom in the Twitter API fueled bots. Personally I have never built a Twitter bot, only because I don&rsquo;t need another distraction, and I can see the addictive potential of bot design.
My partner in crime Audrey Watters (@audreywatters), who has hands on experience building her own bots, said something interesting the other day while we were partaking in our daily IPAs&mdash;the wordnik APIs it the base building block of any Twitter bot.
Sure enough, when you search &ldquo;twitter bots wordnik&rdquo; on the Googlez, you get a wide variety of python, nobde.js, php, and other recipes for building Twitter bots, with almost all of them using the Wordnik API as the core linguistics engine for the bot.
Two overlaps with other stories I written here. 1) I feel the Twitter API holds a lot of potential as a training ground for IoT connectivity, and 2) I think APIs, and specifically the Wordnik API, and the work to come out of Wordnik, like Swagger, has a significant role to play in the future of the Internet.
I know many of us technologists have grand visions of where the Internet is going, and would like things to happen faster. but I think the &ldquo;smart&rdquo; everything we are looking for is going to take some time, and is something you can see playing out slowly in things like Twitter bot design. I&rsquo;m sure there are many negative incarnations, but many of the Twitter bots I&rsquo;ve seen have been interesting little nuggets of API driven (Twitter &amp; Wordnik) chaos, driving us towards an unknown, but definitely Internet connected, online world.

			<p><em>28 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>I'm rebuilding my underlying architecture using microservices, and docker containers, and I'm using APIs.json for navigation and discovery within these new API stacks that I use to make my world go around. As I assign each microservice, and APIs.json file, taking inventory of the building blocks that make the service operate, I also begin including docker into the equation, and I find myself using Swagger definitions as a sort of fingerprint for my docker powered microservices. Each microservice lives as its own Github repository, within a specific organization. I give each one its own APIs.json, indexing all the elements APIs of that specific microservice. This can include anything I feel is important, like: X-Signup - Where to signup for the service. X-Twitter - The twitter account associated with the service. X-Samples - Where you can find client side code samples. As long as you put X- before the property, you can put anything you want. There are only a handful of sanctioned APIs.json property types, and one of them you will find in almost all my APIs.json files generated for my platform is: Swagger - A reference to a machine readable Swagger definition for each API. Another one I&rsquo;m starting to use, as I&rsquo;m building out my microservice infrastructure, is: X-Docker-Image - A link to a docker image that supports this API. Each of my microservices I have a supporting Docker image that is the backend for each API. Sometimes I will have multiple Docker images for variant back-ends for the same API fingerprint. Using APIs.json I can go beyond just finding the API definition, and other supporting building blocks. I can also find the backend needed to actually deliver on the API I have defined by a specific Swagger definition. I&rsquo;m just in the early stages of this work, and this series of posts reflects me trying to work much of this out.

			<p><em>28 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m rebuilding my underlying architecture using microservices and docker containers, and the glue I&rsquo;m using to bind it all together is APIs.json. I&rsquo;m not just using APIs.son to deliver on discoverability for all of my services, I am also using it to navigate around my stack. Right now I only have about 10 microservices running, but I have a plan to add almost 50 in total by the time I&rsquo;m done with this latest sprint. Each microservice lives as its own Github repository, within a specific organization. I give each one its own APIs.json, indexing all the elements APIs of that specific microservice. APIs.json has two main collections, "apis" and "include". For each microservice APIs.json, I list all the properties for that API, but I use the include element to document the urls of other microservice APIs.json in the collection. All the Github repositories for this microservice stack lives within a single Github organization, which I give a "master" repo, which acts as a single landing page for the entire stack. It has its own APIs.json file, but rather than having any API collections, it just uses includes, referencing the APIs.json for each microservice in the stack. APIs.json acts as an index for each microservice, but through the include collection it also provides links to other related microservices within its own stack, which I use to navigate, in a circular way between all supporting services. All of that sounds very dizzying to write out, and I&rsquo;m sure you are like WTF? You can browse my work on Github, some of it is public, but much of it you have to have oAuth access to see. The public elements all live in the gh-pages branch, while the private aspects live within the private master branch. This is all a living workbench for me, so expect broken things. If you have questions, or would like more access to better understand, let me know.

			<p><em>28 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I spend time each day reviewing about 15 different press release distribution websites, looking for API related news for API.Report, and potentially seeds for stories elsewhere on the API Evangelist network.
One thing I&rsquo;m noticing a lot, are companies who reference their API as bullet point in a release, or sometimes as a footnote in their about section at the end of the release, but when you go to their website you can&rsquo;t find any mention of API.
I&rsquo;m guessing for many, they just haven&rsquo;t thought about making the API something that is front and center, relinquishing it to just "feature status". There are also others who do not believe in the whole &ldquo;public&rdquo; API thing, and see their API as more secret sauce, something that should be kept close to your chest.
Whatever the reason, I&rsquo;m looking to better understand how I can help companies be more public with their API presence, even if the API itself isn&rsquo;t open to the public. My first instinct is to just email the company, and ask why they aren&rsquo;t more public with API, but I know from experience it isn&rsquo;t the best approach. ;-)
With this in mind, I&rsquo;ll be exploring new ways I can encourage companies to be more public with their API presence, and help them understand the benefits of this approach&mdash;let me know if you have any good ideas.

			<p>I have most of the core platform that I run API Evangelist on re-engineered as individual microservices, defined on Github, and running using Docker instances. I&rsquo;m using APIs.json for discovery, navigation, and to connect swagger API definitions, to their docker backends. So far I have 18 microservices, which I define as very simple APIs, that do one thing, and focus on doing it well. I&rsquo;m very critical about any feature I add in, working hard to keep each service as micro as I can, reducing complexity, and bloat in any single API. However, with each service I reach the point where I have to cut off feature creep, and establish an entirely new API definition--I am at this point with my link service. I have a pretty bloated link management system in the legacy version of my platform, something which handles links for functions ranging from Pinboard integration, to handling linkrot on my public website. My legacy system runs using an API too, but it is a sloppily designed API, with a wide surface area, something I&rsquo;m looking to prevent in the next version. So far I&rsquo;ve broken out a single API into three separate microservices: Link - A dead simple link management tool, allowing me to add a title, and url to a simple link data store, for future use. Curated - A service to manage links I curate from many sources, including additional bells &amp; whistles, like pulling text body, taking screenshot, and much more.&nbsp; Linkrot - A link storage system designed for a singe purpose&mdash;to address link rot on my public websites. The API works with a simple JS library to store, monitor, and take screenshots of websites I link to across my network. I have about five other simple, link related, microservices I&rsquo;m planning, but these three designs represent the main link resources I need to make API Evangelist work. All of the microservices I&rsquo;m designing will be open sourced at...[<a href="/2015/01/28/how-much-api-surface-area-before-it-stops-being-micro/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
I cringe, when I think about the number of mobile applications out there, that people depend on in their personal and professional lives, that are using insecure APIs, allowing&nbsp;personally identifiable information (PII) to flow across the open Internet. I&rsquo;m a big advocate for helping mobile developers understand the important role that a public API can play in this situation, but another side of the discussions that also scares me is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) that also emerges as part of this conversation.
I&rsquo;ve covered recent security and privacy involving mobile usage of APIs at Snapchat, and Moonpig, and was processing the API news this morning for inclusion on API.Report, when I came across this press release, Wandera Finds Official NFL App to be Leaking Users' Personal Data Just Days Ahead of The Big Game. I can get behind the NFL securing their users personal data, but have a hard time jumping on the bandwagon when this is used as PR for a mobile security service, in the lead up to the Superbowl.
Understanding how everyday mobile apps are using APIs to communicate in the cloud is important. Sharing stories about how to map out this very public surface area, and secure it properly, while giving end-users more awarness and control over their PII is critical. Doing this in the name of marketing, PR, or to ride a fear hype wave is not ok. Yet, I fear this will become commonplace in coming months and years, as security breaches, cybersecurity, and privacy are front and center in the media.

			<p><em>27 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>
As we get close to wrapping up the first month in 2015, it is clear that Internet security and privacy will continue to be front and center this year. As technology continues to play a central role in our personal and business lives--security, transparency, and respect for privacy is only growing more critical.
I know I'm biased in thinking that APIs will continue to take a central role in this conversation, but I feel it is true. Many of the existing conversations around security about platforms like Snapchat, and MoonPig, are directly related to APIs, while other security scope at companies like Sony, JP Morgan Chase, and beyond could easily be reduced with a sensible API strategy.
Companies are increasingly operating online, but do not act like any of information lives in an online environment. Adopting an API approach to defining company resources, helps map out this surface area, acknowledging it is available over the Internet, and works to define, secure, and monitor this surface in a healthier way.
Mobile users need access to their data, and by applying an API centric approach, providing account management, data portability, and access and identity controls using oAuth, you can increase transparency, while also strengthening overall security. If your company operations is centered around customer and end-user data transactions, you should be making all data points available via an API, accompanied by a well oiled oAuth layer to help end-users manage their resources, playing a significant role in their own privacy and security.
I'm not delusional in thinking that APIs provide a perfect solution for all our security and privacy woes, it doesn't, but it does set a tone for a more healthy conversation about how companies are doing business on the open Internet, and how we can better secure the online web, mobile, and device-based applications we are increasingly depending on in this new world we have created.

			<p><em>26 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>When you start talking about generating server or client side code for APIs, using machine readable API definition formats like Swagger or API Blueprint, many technologists feel compelled to let you know, that at some point you will hit a wall. There is only so far you can go, when using your API definition as guide for generating server-side or clienit-side code, but in my experience you can definitely save some significant time an energy, by auto-generating code using Swagger definitions. I just finished re-designing 15 APIs that support the core of API Evangelist, and to support the work I wrote four separate code generation tools: PHP Server - Generating a Slim PHP framework for my API, based upon Swagger definition. PHP Client - Assemble a custom PHP client of my design, using Swagger definition as guide. JavaScript Client -&nbsp;Assemble a custom JavaScript client of my design, using Swagger definition as guide. MySQL Database - Generate a MySQL script based upon the data models available in a Swagger definition. Using Swagger, I can get myself 90-100% of the way for most of the common portions of the APIs I design. When writing a simple CRUD API like notes, or for links, I can auto-generate the PHP server, and a JS client, and underlying MySQL table structure, which in the end, runs perfectly with no changes. Once I needed more custom functionality, and have more unique API calls to make, I then have to get my hands dirty, and begin manually working in the code. However auto-generation of code sure gets me a long way down the road, saving me time doing the really mundane, heavy lifting in creating the skeleton code structures I need to get up an running with any new API. I&rsquo;m also exploring using APIs.json, complete with Swagger references, and Docker image references to further bridge this gap. In my opinion, a Swagger definition for any API, can act as a fingerprint...[<a href="/2015/01/26/my-experiences-generating-api-server-or-client-code-using-swagger/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>26 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m slowly processing XML files of patents from the US Patent Office. You can read the origin of my journey here, but as of today, I finished processing 50 files of patent applications for 2013, adding 973 API related patents to the queue. I&rsquo;m still making sense of the different types of patents, and whether they are specifically for APIs, more API adjacent, or just mention API as one component in the patent definition. I figure I&rsquo;ll go back to about 1990-1995, but not 100% sure at this point. So far I&rsquo;ve identified 105 patent applications from 2015, 322 from 2014, and now 973 from 2013. I&rsquo;m still reading the title and abstract of each patent application as they come in, building my understanding of what has been submitted, and the possible motivations behind each application. Here are the current numbers that I have so far. There are 6 patents so far that mention application programming interface or API directly in the title of the patent: 12953023 - Providing customized visualization of application binary interface/application programming interface-related information - Red Hat, Inc. 11559545 - 3D graphics API extension for a shared exponent image format - Nvidia Corporation 12832025 - Application programming interface, system, and method for collaborative online applications - Apple Inc. 12974934 - Method and apparatus for reverse patching of application programming interface calls in a sandbox environment - Adobe Systems Incorporated 13178356 - Application programming interface for identifying, downloading and installing applicable software updates - Microsoft Corporation 12716022 - Secure expandable advertisements using an API and cross-domain communications - eBay Inc. There are 54 patents that mention application programming interface or API directly in the abstract of the patent: 14477614 - System and method for connecting, configuring and testing wireless devices and applications - Jasper Technologies, Inc. 13974635 - Information processing device, information processing method, and program - Sony Corporation 13564610 - System and method for detecting errors in audio data - NVIDIA...[<a href="/2015/01/26/finished-processing-973-api-related-patents-from-2013/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>David Berlind&rsquo;s (@dberlind), Amid The API Copyright Controversy, An API Patent Claim Surfaces story from this last Friday, planted some ideas in my head around APIs and patents&mdash;something that once takes hold, becomes hopeless for me to resist, and 48 hours later, here are my initial thoughts. Before I begin, let me state, patents and APIs, much like copryight and APIs, are not concepts I subscribe to, but because they are concepts that are being wielded in the API space, I am forced to enter the conversation. I&rsquo;ll let you read David&rsquo;s piece on Pokitdok&rsquo;s claim regarding their &ldquo;patent-pending API&rdquo; for yourself, something I find very troubling (about Pokitdok). My post is about my journey, after I read David's story, resulting in yet another&nbsp;research project into the politics of patents involving APIs. After reading David's story this Saturday AM (yeah I need a life), I started &ldquo;googling&rdquo; the concept of API patents, just to educate myself&mdash;my eternal mission at API Evangelist. I was very surprised to find the number of results that come up when you search Google Patents for the term &ldquo;application programming interface&rdquo;&mdash;about 552,000 results (0.32 seconds), to be precise. What does this mean? I start reading, and 48 hours later I&rsquo;m still reading. Sure there a number of older patents for hardware APIs, and even many APIs that were established during the web service heyday of the late 90&rsquo;s and early 2000&rsquo;s, but there is much more than that. I was surprised to see the number of patents with APIs as the main focus from API sector leaders like AWS, Twilio, Apigee, and Google. I have to start with two of the most ironic API patents i have found so far, during my search: Google (Through Unisys Patent Portfolio Acquisition) - Generation of Java language application programming interface for an object-oriented data store - An embodiment of the present invention is a technique to interface to a repository.

			<p><em>23 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>
i&rsquo;m spending a lot of time lately, playing around with different approaches to deploying APIs in Docker containers. Part of this is because it is the latest trend in API deployment and management, but also because I&rsquo;m preparing for my talk at API Days in Sydney Australia next month.
I am always working to keep my keynotes in sync with not just my own work, but in alignment with where the wider conversation is going in the API space. I&rsquo;m building off my talk at Defrag last November, which was titled, "containers will do for APIs what APIs have done for companies".
The title of my talk at API Days in Sydney is, "The Programmable World With APIs And Containers". While some of my talk will be inspirational, trying to understand where we are headed with APIs and containers, much of it will also be rooted in my own work to run my own business world using APIs and Docker, and using APIs.json and Swagger to help me orchestrate my resources.
I apologize for the gaps in my normal writing, and the heavy focus on Docker lately, but it is where my mind is at, from an operational standpoint, in preparation for the conversation in Australia, and from what I&rsquo;m seeing, it is in sync with the wider API and cloud computing conversation.

			<p><em>23 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>
The API space is continuing its rapid expansion, and along with the number of API design, deployment, management, and integration providers, and the number of API conferences, there are some new sources of discussion around APIs--one as a YouTube Channel, and the other as a SoundCloud podcast.

API Workshop - We'll discuss topics around API Design, including: sustainability concepts: how to design APIs that last, new ideas in API design, voices and posts from the API blog world.
APIsUncensored - The official home of the APIs Uncensored podcast, a monthly series where Ole Lensmar and Lorinda Brandon blather about all things APIs with experts in the industry.


API Workshop is a production by J(a)son Harmon (@jharmn), and APIsUncensored is from the smart folks over at SmartBear(when describing them I always feel tricked into saying they are smart). I was honored to have mentions in both of them, and you can read my response to API Workshop here, and to APIsUncensored over here.
In my opnion, it is a healthy sign for the space to see more video and audio outlets emerge&mdash;the space needs as many open voices, educating the masses as it can possess. Maybe soon we'll need an aggregator of all the sources of great information! (get to work on that please)
I posted a video in response to my reference in the API Workshop episode, in addition to my blog post. Something I&rsquo;m working on for APIsUncensored as well, continuing to expand my presence on these important channels. Personally I&rsquo;m a big podcast listener, over YouTubing, but everyone has a different set of frequencies they tune into, and I think it is important to maximize the reach.
Now if only we could get the next episode of Traffic &amp; Weather! Wink, Wink!

			<p><em>23 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>There is a new podcast on SoundCloud called APIsUncensored, from the folks over at SmartBear. I was honored to have a mention in the first episode, where they brought up a project I did a couple of months back, which I called the Subway Map API. I published a full story on what I was doing, and launched supporting Github repo, and API, but the work was very much a weekend side project, and something that will need a lot more love before it goes anywhere. Ole Lensmar (@olensmar) admitted that when he introduced the project, he didn&rsquo;t really get it, but ultimately in their segment, they accomplished what I was looking to do&mdash;stimulate conversation. The Subway Map API isn&rsquo;t about the ideas I plotted on the map for API Evangelist, it is about the format for grouping, and mapping out iof deas&mdash;then evolving them through conversation. Don&rsquo;t get hung up on my groupings of API design, deployment, management, etc., because my mission is to help introduce people to the world of providing and consuming APIs. The goal of the project is to provide a platform where anyone can step up and frame a conversation about the lifecycle that means the most to them, their company, their products, and industry. When I first published the proejct, I quickly sent it out to two groups: 3Scale - Life-cycle to 3Scale is about helping people manage the APIs they&rsquo;ve deployed, and I will be helping create a v1 map, based upon great work that Manfred has done on this subject. SmarBear - Life-cycle to SmartBear is about helping people monitor, test, and understand the APIs they posses, and if you guys have any stories on your blog to help me see this vision, I can help translate into a map. Don&rsquo;t get hung up on the maps I created, and don&rsquo;t even get hung up on it being a subway map.

			<p><em>22 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>I come across a lot of API related companies during my monitoring of the space, which I queue up, and as I have time, I work to explore and understand what they do. One company that I&rsquo;ve had open in a tab for the last week is HTTPHUB. HTTPHUB is very interesting. It starts by giving you a root namespace, like https://kinlane.httphub.com, and from there I can add on any resources on, and make it either public or private&mdash;then I can POST any JSON to this resource in the body. So I could create https://kinlane.httphub.com/notes/, and craft a simple form + script to post any data I submit to my HTTPHUB resource. I think that HTTPHUB captures the simplicity of APIs. Obviously the system will have some limitations, but ultimately it makes on boarding with the concept of APIs, and getting up and running with an API backend as frictionless as possible. HTTPHUB also gives you logging, and user management for your namespace, adding some other essential elements you will need for your API backend. Here are some of the features of an HTTPHUB account: Unlimited requests (rate limited) 3Gb of storage space 300.000 resources 3.000 namespace users 3Mb Max POST size Signup and quota management for namespace users Authenticate with credentials or IP address Register up to 5 different accounts using the same email address HTTPHUB also provides a pretty slick demo feature, using demo test data, in conjunction with Postman. They provide you with a link to the Postman Chrome app, and a link to a collection file that you can import. This gives you a listing of all of the base endpoints for HTTPHUB, which you can then use to expand, and manage your HTTPHUB API backend--no programming necessary. HTTPHUB is most interesting to me because its simple, intuitive, and potentially something you could self-define exactly the backend resources you need, as you need them. Imagine if applications could grow its own...[<a href="/2015/01/22/simple-intuitive-api-backends-with-httphub/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I've been a Postman user for a while, as a tool for quickly making API calls against the APIs I use most, and explore the new APIs I discover daily. As I use Postman, I can't help but think the concept of assembling collections of API calls using Postman, is in sync with part of our vision for APIs.json--we just need a common way to communicate.
APIs.json is not just for defining the API operations that exist within a specific domain, which is the most common approach, it is also about assembling collections of multiple APIs, for a specific purpose. In my mind, the motivations for assembling Postman collections, and APIs.json collections are definitely in alignment.
Similar to providing resources for translating between popular API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint, I want to make sure and translate between emerging API discovery and collection formats. While I&rsquo;d love for APIs.json to become the default standard for API discovery, I&rsquo;m happy to embrace other formats, designed for other API tools&mdash;as long as they are striving to be as open as they can.

			<p>I sign up for a lot of APIs, and when I encounter a frictionless on-boarding process, I feel the need to showcase, and help everyone understand how important it is to make the process as easy as possible. I'm still amazed at how many new APIs make this really, really hard. I will write a separate story after this about how not to on-board with an API, but for now lets take a look at a kick-ass example. This example comes from the&nbsp;National Institutes of Health (NIH) 3D Print Exchange API. When it comes to signing up for API access, the only thing that can make this easier is providing an API for the process, but for right from the home page you can signup for an API key. Once I provide my first name, last name, email, and optionally some details on how I will use the APIs, I am given my API key. I don&rsquo;t have to click again to find my API key, and I&rsquo;m given an example API call, complete with my API key.&nbsp; My first click gives me the instant gratification I am looking for via a simple API call, resulting in an example JSON response. I do not have to work to find my key or figure out how to make my first API call, it is all given to me immediately. I'm up and running with the&nbsp;NIH 3D Print Exchange API in two clicks. I don't have to fill out a long form, wait for access, or work to find my keys, and fumble with how to make my first API call. To reenforce this, I look in my email inbox, and there is an email providing my API keys again, along with the link to make my first API call. Like I said above, the only thing that would make that easier, is for all of this to be a series of API calls, which would make...[<a href="/2015/01/21/this-is-how-you-onboard-with-an-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>I referenced the Recreation Information Database (RIDB), in my story late last year, when I was asking for your help to make sure the Department of Agriculture leads with APIs in their parks and recreation RFP. I'm not exactly sure where it fits in with the RFP, because the RIDB spans multiple agencies. Here is the description from the RIDB site: RIDB is a part of the Recreation One Stop (Rec1Stop) project, initiated as a result of a government modernization study conducted in 2004. Rec1Stop provides a user-friendly, web-based resource to citizens, offering a single point of access to information about recreational opportunities nationwide. The web site represents an authoritative source of information and services for millions of visitors to federal lands, historic sites, museums, and other attractions/resources. When I wrote the post last October, I referenced the PDF for the REST API Requirements for the US Forest Service Recreation Information Database (RIDB), but this week I got an update, complete with fresh links to a preview of a pretty well designed API, complete with documentation developed using Slate. I haven&rsquo;t actually hacked on the endpoints, but I took a stroll through the docs, and my first impression was it is well designed, and robust, including resources for organizations involved with the RDB, recreational areas, facilities, campsites, permit entrances, tours, activities, events, media, and links. The RIDB documentation also includes details on errors, pagination, version, and a data dictionary, and the on-boarding was frictionless when looking to get a key. Everything is in dev mode with the RIDB API, and the team is looking for feedback. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure they wanted me to publish as story on API Evangelist, but I figure the more people involved the better, as I&rsquo;m not sure when I&rsquo;ll get around to actually hacking on the API. I&rsquo;m happy to see such a quick iteration towards the next generation of the RIDB API, and it makes me hopeful to...[<a href="/2015/01/21/the-next-steps-for-the-the-recreation-information-database-ridb-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>API storyteller J(a)son Harmon (@jharmn) has a new YouTube channel up called API Workshop. He's going to be publishing regular API design workshop episodes, with the latest one titled REST API Design: Avoid future proofing with the JSON junk drawer. J(a)son provides a nice overview of how you should be structuring the JSON for your API, focusing on the usage of key / value stores. Ironically he uses APIs.json as an example of why you SHOULD NOT use custom key / values within your JSON. What is ironic about this, is that he makes the case for APIs.json properties, giving me a great starting point for helping folks better understand APIs.json, and why properties are key to its evolution, and flexibility. The process J(a)son outlines in the portion of this segment that referred to APIs.json, describes the lifecycle of an APIs.json property, towards becoming more of a "first class property". There are three phases of an APIs.json property: X-Property - A user defined property, allowing anyone to craft exactly the properties that matter to them Property - An official machine readable APIs.json property element, acknowledging its wide usage, potential as common blueprint "First Class Property or Collection"&nbsp;- Baking a property into the specification as default property of APIs collection, or establishing as sub-collection for the API The lesson J(a)son provides, describes the journey of each APIs.json property, the difference is in that his lesson provides best practices for API providers who are designing new APIs, helping them avoid the creation of a junk drawer, and the APIs.json property format is being applied to define the junk drawer that we have (aka the public API space). This represents the fundamental separation between my approach to defining the space vs. many other technologists&mdash;I am trying to map out what we have, and get us the next step in our evolution, while others are working hard to define where we should be going.

I wrote a piece earlier today about the kick-ass on-boarding process at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 3D Print Exchange API--within two clicks I had my API key and was making an API call. To contrast this post I wanted to provide an example of how not to on-board with an API.
I am always amazed at how hard people make it to sign up and play with an API in 2015. Today's example of on-boarding with the most friction you can imagine comes from the Garmin Wellness API--I think their API signup form speaks for itself.

I understand you are worried about what people might do with your API, but that is kind of the whole point of doing an API. If you are looking to encourage innovation on your API, this is not how you want to on-board your developers, and make a first impression.
There are other ways to manage API integrations without restricting users from day one. Make sure and help make API on-boarding as frictionless as possible, there is no reason to use a form like Garmin has.

			<p><em>21 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>
There is an very interesting new 3D Print Exchange API from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIH 3D Print Exchange is designed for publishing "biomedically-relevant" 3D models, that anyone can download and use as blueprint for printing on a their 3D printer.
I've been tracking on 3D printing APIs since 2011, when I started profiling how APIs were being used by printing, and 3D printing providers. It is interesting to see an industry focused 3D printing API emerge, which I feel is a sign the space is maturing, and will continuing to evolve in 2015.
Another thing to note in this story, is simplistic approach the NIH took in deploying their API. The 3D Print Exchange API has all the essential building blocks to help you understand what the API does, on-board with the API (another story), and get the support you need throughout integration via Twitter,&nbsp;Github, and email.
The 3D Print Exchange API has all the fingerprints of 18F on it, demonstrating that APIs in the federal government will continue to pick up momentum with the assistance of 18F of the Presidential Innovation Fellowship (PIF) program out of the White House and GSA.

			<p><em>15 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>
We just added three new speakers to the lineup for @APIStrat Berlin this April 24th and 25th. I get pretty excited about this part of the event planning lifecycle, which is all about reviewing talks that being submitted, and working with the rest of the APIStrat, and now the API Days team, to develop the best lineup possible.
Here are the three that we added today:




Antti Silventoinen (@lamantiini) of&nbsp;Music Kickup



Jordi Romero (@jordiromero) of&nbsp;Redbooth



Matt Boyle (@mboylevt) of&nbsp;Shapeways



&nbsp;
These three speakers represent APIs and the music industry, project collaboration, and 3D printing&mdash;which I think is a pretty nice representation of how APIs are making an impact in 2015.
If you haven&rsquo;t submitted a talk, make sure and head over to the APIStrat call for talks page, and make sure you are part of the lineup in Berlin, this April&mdash;we will be closing the call for talks soon, so make sure you do it quick!

			<p><em>15 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>An open project for me this month, is about better understanding how API keys are provisioned, and how developers are given access to valuable resources. As the number of APIs grows, so do the number of APIs that we depend on in any single application, forcing developer to have to manage many API keys, potentially from many different platforms. It doesn&rsquo;t take an API expert to see that many current practices by API providers requiring consumers to manually register for an account, will not scale. We need more automated ways for not just discovering, but also on-boarding with APIs, allowing API consumers to begin using an API, without the current overhead required. One idea I&rsquo;m bouncing around in my own APIs, is allowing for instant account creation via an API, allowing you to programmatically generate new account, a new app, and API keys. Of course I do not want these new accounts to have full access to everything, and using my 3Scale API management I will create a specific service tier for these accounts, limiting what they can do. I want to take this another step further though, I do not want just any spammy, Johnny come-along to be able to create new accounts, without any sort of validation. To help filter, I&rsquo;m developing a Github account ranking layer, requiring you to pass along your Github user with the generation of new account, app, and keys. I will pull the profile for the Github user, and some statistics on their overall profile, and make some assumptions on the developers trustworthiness. Immediately this approach will limit API access for a number of people, which in some scenarios may not be ideal, but for my APIs, I&rsquo;m willing to allow instant account creation, and API access to people who have an active, verifiable Github presence. I&rsquo;ve been a proponent of API providers providing Github login for developer accounts for some time now, and this seems like a...[<a href="/2015/01/15/instant-access-to-apis-via-github-profile/">Read More</a>]</p>

My public websites have been running on Github Pages for almost two years now, and slowly the private management tools for my platform are moving there as well. Alongside my public websites, I&rsquo;m adding administrative functions for each projects. Most of the content is API driven already, so it makes sense to put some of the management tools side by side with the content or data that I&rsquo;m publishing.
These management tools are simple JavaScript, that use the Github API to manage HTML, and JSON files that I have stored either publicly or privately within repositories. I use Github oAuth to work with the Github API, but to work with other APIs I need a multitude of other API keys, including 3Scale generated API keys I use to access my own API infrastructure.
My solution is to store a simple api-keys.json file in the root of my private master repository, and then again using Github oAuth, and the Github API, I access this file, read the content of the JSON file into a temporary array I can use wthin my management tools. If you do not have access to the Github repository, you won&rsquo;t be able to read the contents of api-keys.json, rendering the management tools useless.
I will develop a centralized solution to helping manage API keys across all my projects, allowing me to re-use keys for different projects, and easily update, or remove outdated API keys. This approach to storing API keys in my private Github repository is allowing me to easily access keys in client-side apps I run on Github Pages, as well as via server-side applications and APIs&mdash;something that I&rsquo;m hoping will give me more flexibility in how I put multiple APIs across my infrastructure.

			<p><em>10 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>When I discuss what is possible when it comes to generating both server and client side code using machine readable API definitions like Swagger, I almost always get push-back, making sure I understand there are limitations of what can be auto-generated. Machine readable API definitions like Swagger provide a great set of rules for describing the surface area of an API, but is often missing many other elements necessary to define what server side code should actually be doing. The closest I&rsquo;ve gotten to fully generating server side APIs, is when it came to very CRUD-based APIs, that possess a very simple data models--beyond that it is difficult to make "ends meet". Personally, I do not think my Swagger specs should contain everything needed to define server implementations, this would make for a very bloated, and unusable Swagger specification. For me, Swagger is my central truth, that I use in generating server side skeletons, client side samples and libraries, and to define testing, monitoring, and interactive documentation for developers. Working to push this approach forward, I&rsquo;m also now using Swagger as a central truth for my Docker containers, allowing me to use virtualization as a bridge between what my Swagger definitions cannot define for each micro-service or API deployed within a specific container. This approach is leaving Swagger as purely a definition of the micro-service surface area, and leaving my Docker image to deliver on the back-end vision of this surface area. These Docker images are using Swagger as a definition for its container surface area, but also as a fingerprint for the value it delivers. As an example, I have a notes API definition in Swagger, for which I have two separate Docker images that support this interface. Each Docker image knows it only serves this particular Swagger specification, using it as a kind of fingerprint or truth for its own existence, but ultimately each Docker image will be delivering its own back-end experience...[<a href="/2015/01/10/using-containers-to-bridge-what-swagger-cannot-define-on-the-serverside-for-my-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I continuing to evolve my use of Swagger as a kind of central truth in my API design, deployment, and management lifecycle. This time I&rsquo;m using it as a fingerprint for defining how APIs or micro-services that run in Docker containers function. Along the way I&rsquo;m also using APIs.json as a framework for organizing these Swagger driven containers, into coherent API stacks or collections, that work together to accomplish a specific objective.
For the project I&rsquo;m currently working on, I&rsquo;m deploying multiple Swagger defined APIs, each as separate Docker containers, providing some essential components I need to operate API Evangelist, like blog, links, images, and notes. Each of these components have its own Swagger definition, and corresponding Docker image, and specific instance of that Docker image deployed within a container.
I&rsquo;m using APIs.json to daisy chain all of these APIs or micro-services together. I have about 15 APIs deployed, each are standalone services, with their own APIs.json, and supporting Swagger definition, but the overall project has a centralized APIs.json, which using the includes properties, provides linkage to each individual micro-services APIs.json--loosely coupling all of these container driven micro-services under single umbrella.
At this point, I&rsquo;m just using APIs.json as a harness to define, and bring together the technical aspects of my new API stack. As I pull together other business elements like on-boarding, documentation, and code samples, I will add these as properties to my parent APIs.json. My goal is to demonstrate the value&nbsp;APIs.json brings to the table when it comes to API and micro-service discovery, specifically when you deploy distributed API stacks or collections using Docker container deployed micro-services.

			<p><em>08 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I find it more valuable to scrub the names of the APIs from about 75% of my stories, which I feel helps them be received by a widest possible audience as possible. If I say &ldquo;API Provider X&rdquo;, other providers just think I&rsquo;m talking about that company, but when I make it generic, I find API providers think I&rsquo;m talking about them.
There are many reasons I would scrub individual or company names from a story, most often this is because they&rsquo;ve asked me not to reference them public, but are fine with me telling the story in an anonymous fashion. However, it occurred to me over time that there are other more powerful storytelling influences potentially behind leaving out specific characters.
Early on I identified that there are a lot of API lessons to be learned across business sectors, but if you reference the specific company, or business sector, many business leaders or developers will put there blinders on, feeling this doesn&rsquo;t apply to them. Ideally companies would identify the potential of hearing stories from other ways of doing business, but unfortunately many lack the imagination to make the transition&mdash;lucky I have enough imagination to go around! ;-)
I thoroughly enjoy storytelling in the API space. Over the last four years I&rsquo;ve developed a voice I enjoy speaking in, and have slowly built an entire toolbox of approaches like scrubbing people or company names, to make my storytelling more impactful, and potentially reach a wider audience. I feel strongly that I would never have been able to do this if API Evangelist was purely a marketing blog for a company, but because I&rsquo;m lucky enough to be able to focus exclusively on entire API space, spanning multiple business sectors, and left to my own devices when it comes to the editorial choices--I&rsquo;ve been able to grow my storytelling in ways I never imagined in 2010 when I first started.

			<p>
I talked about Twitter's inclusion of rate limits inline with documentation the other day, which is something I added as a new building block, that API providers can consider when crafting their own strategy. Another building block I found while spending time in the Twitter ecosystem, was an oAuth signature generator inline within the documentation.
While browsing the Twitter documentation, right before you get to the example request, you get a little dropdown that lets you select from one of your own applications, and generate an oAuth signature without leaving the page.

I am seeing oAuth signature generators emerge in a number of API platforms, but this is the first inline version I&rsquo;m seeing. I&rsquo;ve added this to my tentative list of oAuth and security building blocks I recommend, but will give some time before I add. I like to see more than one provider do something before I put it in there, but sometimes when it is just Twitter, that can be enough.

			<p><em>08 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>
As I read and listen to all of the Internet of Things stories coming out of CES, I&rsquo;m happy to be hearing discussions around privacy and security, come out of the event. I feel better about IoT security and privacy when I hear things like this, but ultimately I am left with overwhelming concern about of the quantity of IoT devices.
There are many layers to securing IoT devices, and protecting the privacy of IoT users, but I can't help but the think that Internet of Things security and privacy will always begin by asking ourselves if we should be doing this at all. Do we need this object connected to the Internet? Are we truly benefiting from having this item enabled with cloud connectivity?
I'm going to try and keep up with tracking on the API layer being rolled out in support of IoT devices, but not sure I will be able to keep up with the number of devices, and the massive amount of hype around products and services. At some point I may have to tap out, and focus on specific aspects of IoT connectivity ,around what I consider the politics of APIs.

			<p><em>08 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>I'm about 1/3 of the way into generating Swagger specifications for the APIs at the 700+ companies that I monitor. I have the Swagger specs for almost 250 APIs so far, and have no idea how many I&rsquo;ll have when I'm done (ha, will I ever be done), as the target is kind of ever moving. The only way to get to know an API better than having to create a Swagger spec for it, is to actually integrate with it. Thankfully I&rsquo;m not integrating with ALL of the APIs I monitor, but I do want to get more intimate with their API surface area, right up to actually having to integrate. There are four ways that I obtain a machine readable API definition for an API: Manually - Good ol fashioned elbow grease because there is nothing standard about an APIs documentation, or even the API itself, forcing me to hand craft a Swagger definition that works. Scraping - Some APIs documentation is pretty standardized, making it very easy to write a scrape script that harvests, and generates a Swagger skeleton of endpoints, headers, parameters, and other aspects of the interface. APITools - Some APIs that I&rsquo;m actually integrating with, going beyond just a review of their API, I use APITools as a proxy, and make all my API calls via this proxy, and after I hit all the endpoints, I can grab the auto-generated Swagger definition from the APITools interface. Swagger - There is already a Swagger definition available for an API, created by the platform owner&mdash;this is when I&rsquo;m in heaven. I love it when APIs create their own API definition, and even better when they create their own APIs.json file. ;-) I would like to also add to the list, that I use API Blueprint, RAML, I/O Docs, and Apigee Explorer formats as well, but I do not. While these formats are out there, it is an understatement to say they...[<a href="/2015/01/08/generating-swagger-specs-for-the-apis-of-the-700-companies-that-i-monitor/">Read More</a>]</p>

A blog post that caught my attention recently was Fuse, Kynetx, and Carvoyant, by Phil Windley (@windley). Phil is pushing the boundaries of connecting devices to the Internet, and is very vocal about his thoughts on the subject&mdash;something I support 100%. If you want a taste of what Phil is thinking, check out his keynote from APIStrat Chicago 2014.
His blog post is a worthy read, but what really caught my attention was in the last paragraph&mdash;the simple statement that he is:
&ldquo;using Fuse as a means to explore how a larger, more owner-controlled Internet of Things experience could be supported&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m intrigued by this concept, and feel it reflects my mission with API Evangelist, where I&rsquo;m looking to create not just a more educated and informed API providers and consumers, but also a more knowledgable, and empowered end-user.
The concept of a owner-controlled Internet of Things experience is something I will be keeping an eye on as I continue to be inundated with Internet of Things API stories. My goal is to better understand how IoT devices are being designed, and deployed, then provide some assistance in how we can ensure platforms lean towards a more &ldquo;owner-controlled experience&rdquo;.

			<p><em>07 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>As I am designing my APIs, one of the first things I decide is whether or not I will be making this public. If its a simple enough resource, and doesn't put too much load on my servers, I will usually make it publicly available. However if an API has write capabilities, could potentially put a heavy load on my servers, or just posses some private resource that I want to keep private, I will secure the API. I use 3Scale for my API management infrastructure--I have since 2011, long before I ever started working with them on projects, and organizing @APIStrat. When it comes time to secure any of my APIs, I have a default snippet of code that I wrap each API, validating the application keys, and recording their activity--which 3Scale calls the plugin integration approach. This time around, I logged into my 3Scale admin area, went to my API integration area, and saw the setup for the 3Scale Cloud API proxy that they are calling APICast. I can't help but notice the simple setup of the proxy--I give it a private base URL for my API, it gives me a public base URL back, and then I can configure the proxy rules, setting the rate limits for each of my API resources. &nbsp; That is it. I can set up my APIs in a sandbox environment, then take it live when I am ready. It is the quickest way to secure my APIs I've seen, allowing me to instantly lock down my APIs, and require anyone who uses it to register for a key, and then I am able to track on how it is being put to use&mdash;no server configuration or setup needed. This easy setup, bundled with the fact you can setup 3Scale for free, and get up to 50K a day in API calls, makes it the perfect environment for figuring out your API surface area. Then when ready,...[<a href="/2015/01/07/the-quickest-way-to-proxy-secure-rate-limit-and-monitor-my-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>
When you use a well designed, and I hate saying it, but a RESTful API, you know it. I&rsquo;m not a restafarian, who is super strict about API design, but I do know an easy-to-use, intuitive interface when I hack on one. Having API resources defined as intuitive URIs, with a handful of sensible header or query parameters, that allows me to excercise my HTTP Verbs, just makes me happy.
I do not expect all API providers to be API design experts, but one design pattern that always frustrates me is when you  pack all of your API resources into a single parameter. Flickr calls it &ldquo;method&rdquo;, and Brightcove calls it &ldquo;command&rdquo;, and while both of these media API providers then offer a rich number of &ldquo;methods&rdquo; or &ldquo;commands&rdquo;, I just can&rsquo;t help feel this single design decision always detours API integrationa &nbsp;down bumpier, darker side street or alley.
Ultimately I can still get what I need done with APIs who choose to craft their resources in this way, but it takes more work, and requires me to create a special bucket of APIs, that don&rsquo;t quite fit in with the rest of the APIs I&rsquo;m profiling, and integrating with. I&rsquo;m often tempted, with the high profile APIs like Flickr and Brightcove, to craft a new API, and stand it up as a facade that you can use as a proxy, instead of directly connecting to Flickr and Brightcove APIs, but alas not enough time in the day.
You will almost never catch me giving API design advice on API Evangelist, but in this scenario, I have urge you not to follow the design patterns of Flickr and Brightcove when planning your APIs.

			<p><em>07 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>The properties of each API that is listed in an APIs.json file can be called anything, as long as you preface it with X-, and the URL can point to anything you wish--to me this is one of the most flexibile aspects of APIs.json. The majority of APIs.json API properties are going to be to URLs designed for human consumption, but the ultimate goal of the project is to establish a core set of machine readable URIs that will help move the API discovery conversation forward. The first three machine readable properties for APIs listed in an APIs.json are: API Blueprint - The machine readable API definition format in markdown. Swagger&nbsp;- The machine readable API definition format in JSON and YAML. RAML&nbsp;- The machine readable API definition format in YAML. APIs.json is not looking to provide the solution for the same thing that sensibly designed hypermedia APIs would bring to the table, and only interested in bridging the indexing of the API resources that are currently available. In this context, think of APIs.json as a switchboard, allowing us to navigate each of the popular API definition formats available to use in 2015. The fourth machine readable property for APIs listed in an APIs.json is: API Commons - A machine readable format for associating licensing fo ran API interface (aka CC, Apache). With&nbsp;APIs.json version .014, we now have a glimpse of the surface area of APIs present within each APIs.json file, via the API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML properties, and a basic awarness of the licensing of this surface area using the API Commons property. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure what is next for APIs.json property types, but if I had my vote (which I probably do ;-), I&rsquo;d be interested in seeing machine readable references to: API Monetization Value - Units of measurement, allowing me to understand the value delivered by an API.

I was cruising around the Google Developer area and I stumbled across Google Helpouts. A service being billed as &ldquo;Experts with Answers, Meet Developers with Questions&rdquo;. Seems like a more one-to-one version of Stack Overflow, where you can get the answers you are looking for when it comes to development on the Google platform, but in a more direct, one-to-one way.
Inversely, you can contribute your developer skills, and be one of the knowledgeable developers who are giving back to the developer community. The Google Helpouts page describes it as: Give Back - Continue Learning - Build Your Reputation. I signed up for an account, gave my profile, but the tags that I was able to connect with my profile really didn&rsquo;t match my skills. It seems very programming language, and platform focused at this point--not really for APIs.

At first glance I thought Google Helpouts was more about Google APIs, available as an exentsion of the Google Developer program, but it seems to be a more tech focused, skills matching service. I think the same concept would work well, if applied to APIs, but I don&rsquo;t see any reason for a new platform, just build it on top of Stack Overflow API&mdash;why re-invent the wheel?

			<p><em>07 Jan 2015</em></p>
			<p>If I had to pick one API that I worship the ground they walk on, and yet for some insane reason I don&rsquo;t write about very often&mdash;it would be the Digital Public Library of America. I can go on for days about how important the work that DPLA does. If you aren&rsquo;t up to speed on DPLA, "The Digital Public Library of America brings together the riches of America&rsquo;s libraries, archives, and museums, and makes them freely available to the world&rdquo;&mdash;via APIs! ;-) I&rsquo;m a history lover, so DPLA is extremely interesting, but what they do is so much more important to society at-large, an area that very few APIs can achieve. I am making an extra effort to publish more DPLA stories on API Evangelist, not just because they need it, but also because their approach to APIs is extremely forward thinking and relevant. First DPLA story out of my writers notebook is about their use of JSON-LD. First off, what is JSON-LD? JSON-LD is a lightweight Linked Data format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is based on the already successful JSON format and provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at Web-scale. So why does DPLA uses JSON-LD? I like their explanation on the DPLA technologies page: Everyone likes JSON, but it&rsquo;s not great for every purpose. Pointing from one JSON object to another is a good example (because we do that a lot). So we use JSON-LD. No worries &ndash; it&rsquo;s still JSON. It&rsquo;s just got a couple of standardized fields. When you are weaving together artifacts from &ldquo;america&rsquo;s libraries, archives, and museums&rdquo;, then providing access as linked data and via APIs, you need to get pretty organized about how you keep track of, and connect your objects. I think it is a testament to the DPLA vision, that they are using JSON-LD, a very structured, and forward leaning vision of how we connect, not just...[<a href="/2015/01/07/connecting-our-history-at-the-digital-public-library-of-america-using-apis-and-jsonld/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
I have read several stories about security breaches in the past couple days, ranging from exploitation of APIs across the distributed systems we are increasingly depending on, to no security at MoonPig for their mobile app, and the reverse engineering of a popular mobile app&mdash;this time it is the Kayak mobile app.
Maybe I am biased, but I can&rsquo;t help but think, in a world increasingly driven by mobile devices, we need to treat all applications like they are external, get to work seting up a proper API program, and secure all apps the same way, no matter whether they are used for internal, partner, or public usage. Treating internal apps differently, opens things up for a whole world of hurt when internal systems are compromised, and ignoring how public facing your API is, when embedded in a popular mobile  app, goes into the same category.
If you have a single API stack, that ALL of your systems integrations, web, mobile, and device based-apps use, you have established a single surface area youneed to secure. Then, if you are using modern API infrastructure, a surface area that you can monitor, and have established relevant service composition, tailored for internal, partner, and public access of resources, you will be able to stay in tune with your API usage, and identify negatives situations much faster--across all devices.
If you are operating your business on the Internet today (i hope you are), consider treating all your apps as external, no matter where they reside, or who uses them&mdash;your overall architecture will be much healthier, and resilient because off because of it.

			<p>I was working in&nbsp;APISpark, playing around with different approaches to creating APIs for data stores i have in Amazon S3, Github, and in Google Spreadsheets. The cloud API deployment solution allows me to generate APIs from CSV, XML, JSON and spreadsheet stores in these locations, to a central API platform faster than I could even consider doing manually. As I&rsquo;m managing a simple data API I have, I see the option to generate a &ldquo;server skeleton&rdquo; in the toolbar, something that is also available to me when working in the Restlet Studio. This is one of the benefits of creating machine readable API definitions like Swagger or API blueprint of your APIs. Restlet doesn&rsquo;t generate server code for you from your file stores, it generates a machine readable definition of your file source, then lets you generate a &ldquo;server skeleton&rdquo; from that. Server skeletons are not a fully functioning API for your file store, APISpark gives you that. These server skeletons are just scaffolding in Java or Node.js, that give you a starting framework for deploying an API beyond the Restlet / APISpark platform. You still have to wire things up to the file store, database, or other location of the data store&mdash;it is just the beginning. I guess my goals with this post is to educate people that it is possible to generate server skeletons from APISpark, using common data sources, but I also just like the name. I have used the term server-side scaffolding, but I like server skeletons better. I think I will keep using it to describe what you can generate server side when you employ API definition formats like Swagger or API Blueprint.

I was taking another look at the Reddit API&nbsp;over the weekend, and thought their listing of API endpoints was pretty interesting. They provide two ways of looking at the platform APIs:

API Section - Listing of Reddit APIs by account, apps, links, listings, and other groupings.
oAuth Scope - Listing of Reddit APIs by the endpoints oAuth scope.

Not sure if it is something all APIs should follow, I just thought it was an interesting approach, something I haven&rsquo;t seen in any other API area. Reddit has a number of APIs, I can see if you have specific goals with the API, this might be useful to have API sorted in this way.

This list is very long, but I have to specifically call out 3Scale, and their support of what I do, without them API Evangelist wouldn&rsquo;t be happening, I wouldn&rsquo;t be doing my research, and open projects like APIs.json, and API Commons wouldn&rsquo;t exist&mdash;additionally we wouldn&rsquo;t be having the @APIStrat conversation that 3Scale makes happen. I&rsquo;m not a big year end wrap-up or predictor type of guy, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean I do not spend a lot of time reflecting this time of year. I honestly don&rsquo;t feel like anything has changed for me, I&rsquo;m just as dedicated to my API Evangelist in 2015 as I ever have, and here is what I&rsquo;m focusing on: Storytelling - Telling stories on my blogs about what the smartest people in the space are doing with APIs. Research - Researching how APIs are impacting a variety of industries, government, and even our personal world. Universities - I am convinced that the next generation workforce needs to be digitally literate to be successful. APIStrat &amp; API Days - Helping facilitate the important tech, business, and political conversations that happen at APIStrat &amp; API Days. APIs.json - Encourage the use of APIs.json to assist in API discovery, and enable the assembling of the next generation API stacks. While there is a lot more going on, this is my primary focus, and what you will find me doing most of the time in 2015. I will be seriously cutting back my travel, to focus on my research and storytelling.

			<p>I saw a story of yet another security breach related to how mobile phones are using APIs today.&nbsp;This one is from Paul Price, on his blog ifc0nfig.com, about the greeting card site MoonPig. Paul highlights the not just lack of, but actual absence of security when making API calls to MoonPig, allowing you to impersonate any user, place orders, add/retrieve card information, and any other API driven feature of the mobile application. MoonPig is looking into it of course: We are aware of claims re customer data and can confirm that all password and payment information is and has always been safe. &mdash; Moonpig (@MoonpigUK) January 6, 2015 When those of us in the API industry talk about public APIs, many folks think we are talking about APIs like Twitter that have publicly available information, or public APIs that allow for anyone to sign up for the service, when in reality, most of the time we are talking about APIs that use the public Internet for transport. MoonPig&rsquo;s awareness regarding their API surface area, and complete lack of security is something we are going to see play out, in numerous very public, high profile security breaches in the coming years. There are hundreds if not thousands of companies out there right now who have the same setup, and rely on security through obscurity (nobody has discovered it yet). I personally recommend treating all APIs used in mobile devices like they are public APIs, with a well defined, very public API definition, bundled with a very public security layer, like oAuth. You can still control who has access to signup and use the API, but one beneficial side effect is you can also treat all internal apps like their are just another user on the API. This is the benefit of public API.

			<p>
Your company's secret sauce doesn't involve keeping your APIs closed and proprietary&mdash;it is about making them as open and accessible as possible, to the point where even your competition can&rsquo;t help but uses them.
I&rsquo;m am always amazed at the amount of effort some companies put into hiding their API interface away, making me register before I can see anything, and dig through the SDK to even understand an APIs surface area.
If you have a public API, or a publicly available mobile app, you have a public API&mdash;put it out there. Be loud and proud of your API designs (if you aren&rsquo;t, then we should have another discussion), make them front and center, within two clicks of your developer landing page.
If you are worried about someone copying your interface, and re-using it in their own API designs, you are in the wrong business. In the API space, this is good. Think AWS EC2 and S3. Everyone under the sun has copied their interface, even their competition, and what has happened? Oh, they are the dominant player in an entirely new way of doing business--using APIs.
If you think your API surface area, aka the naming, description, and order of your API endpoints, parameters, and data models, is your secret sauce, you are wrong. It is how you deliver within that framework, and the services, support, and other building blocks you provide in support of the interface.
Please stop hiding your APIs, put them out there where everyone can find them.

			<p>As I travel around talking to folks about APIs, I spend as much time as I can, educating folks about APIs.json. In the course of my evangelism, I&rsquo;m constantly reminded how little people, who have even heard, and read about APIs.json, really understand about what it actually is. With this in mind, I will be regularly publishing examples of what APis.json is, to help on-board everyone to Steve (@ngynx), and mine vision for APIs.json. APIs.json is an open format, in partnership between 3Scale and API Evangelist, to help API providers make their APIs more discoverable, assist API brokers in aggregating multiple APIs deemed valuable within specific industries, and ultimately empowering API consumers in finding exactly the APIs they need to be successful. Our mission is to make the process of API discovery as portable as we can, enabling it to live on any website, and be found in open search engines like APIs.io. APIs.json is a machine-readable description of your company, and its associated API resources. For each API listed, you give it a name, description, and supporting properties, which may be as simple as providing a link to your documentation, or be as complex as providing a link to a machine readable API definition in the Swagger or API Blueprint format. One APIs.json detail, that I feel many technologists overlook, is that this isn&rsquo;t just discovery in a hypermedia context, this could only be about the discovery of your pricing or maybe just the terms of service page (I know, a hypermedia format can descibe this, but I think you are missing an intermediary step to get the space there!) If you need an example of APIs.json file, a good place to start is the APIs.json for APIEvangelist.com, this provides a good default example of APIs.json working within a single domain.

			<p>I am beginning to track on reverse engineering API story that I come across, so if you find any, feel free to share my way. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with this growing trend, I&rsquo;m talking about the reverse engineering of APIs from popular mobile apps, specifically in situation where the company doesn&rsquo;t have a public API or developer presence. APIs are driving the mobile applications tht we are increasingly depending on, but for some reason in 2015 not all companies expose, or share information about this API surface area with the public. The latest story I came across in this trend is the reverse engineering of the Kayak API using mitproxy. Once upon a time, there was a public Kayak API, but somewhere along the way it went away. There tends to be a lot of misconceptions around how to conduct a public API presence, and when coupled with the ignorance around the tech, business, and politics of APIs, you see a lot of failed public API attempts--that quietly go away. I&rsquo;m continuing to track on this because I think this is a security, and privacy conversation that will continue to unfold in the public sphere, whether we want it to or not. If your APIs are driving a publicly available mobile app, you have public APIs. Period. You might as well treat these APIs like they are public. I&rsquo;m not saying you have to be the next Twitter--I&rsquo;m saying your company needs to get educated on modern technological, business, and legal approaches to making resources available over the open Internet. You do not have to open up your APIs to the general public, but your API surface area is public, and you should be transparent about how you operate them, how you onboard partners, how data flows publicly via your API pipes, and how you manage the security and privacy of your network.

			<p>
I am spending a lot of time lately reviewing Internet of Things (IoT) providers, as I work on a white paper for Gigaom. There are some very interesting approaches to APIs out there in IoT-land, and I&rsquo;m starting to get a feel for some of the patterns, trends, and habits of how IoT providers are approaching their developer efforts.
One pattern I see a lot, and can only assume it comes out of the hardware side of engineering, is a focus on programming language when you talk about your API--something I recommend shifting away from. In the world of web APIs, the focus on the interface, and what it does, and actual programming languages are abstracted away, and provided merely as samples, libraries, and SDKs.
I&rsquo;m guessing that in the mind of developers who are building APIs for devices, they are approaching APIs from their legacy SDK point of view, and there really isn&rsquo;t any decoupling of thought based upon web APIs. For these engineers, I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough, the importance of separating your interface, from your SDKs, and when you craft language about your API, you generalize the API speak, and keep language specific elements strictly in the support areas for those specific SDKs.
You never know, it might be that one Go developer who builds the perfect connector for your device, or some scientist wielding Python, who integrates a sensor into their work, and then things go viral. The chances that this will happen is less likely if you are just talking about the one or two programming languages that you (the platform) are familiar with.

			<p><em>30 Dec 2014</em></p>
			<p>After giving some recent attention to the Twitter API ecosystem, a place where I always learn a lot, I&rsquo;m shifting up my API rate limit building block, in my list of API management resources. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with my concept of &ldquo;building blocks&rdquo;, in 2010 I started looking at the top APIs, and tracking on the common &ldquo;building blocks&rdquo; these providers are using to successfully operate their API platform. As I go into 2015, I&rsquo;m still refining, and adding to this list, in hopes of establishing a common list of building blocks, that any API provider can consider as they are designing, and operating their own platforms. Until now, I had a single building block, underneath a category I titled &ldquo;service levels&rdquo;, which I called the rate limit page. My intent with this building block is to help API providers understand the importance of sharing details on how they rate limit API access, and publish it to a single page for developers to use when on-boarding, and throughout their API integration life-cycle. After seeing how Twitter handles their rate limit, which includes this overview page on rate limiting, I&rsquo;m now adding two new building blocks, and putting all of them under new category titled &ldquo;Rate Limiting&rdquo;. I now have three rate limiting related API building blocks I recommend API providers consider when designing their platform: Rate Limits Page&nbsp;- Developers need to understand what the limitations of API usage are upfront. Rate limiting an throttling of API access has become commonplace to manage security, and resource load. This building block is about providing a single page explaining how this process works, setting expectations with API consumers. Rate Limit Information Inline In Docs&nbsp;- In addition to a rate limits page, explaining information about limitations on API usage, some API providers like Twitter are including rate limits within API documentation. With this approach, each API endpoint has its related rate limits published alongside other details.

			<p><em>30 Dec 2014</em></p>
			<p>When you first land on any API developer landing page, the impression you get, can be one of the most important aspects of on-boarding with an API that I know of. More time than not, I'm pretty confused when I land on the landing page of APIs, being forced to look for what I need to get up and running with API what an API does, and how I will have to integrate with it. Anytime I come across an API landing page, where I'm immediately given the best possible first impression I can image, I have to showcase. This just happened while taking another look at the Etsy API, which I found refreshingly simple--yet complete. Everything on the Etsy API developer landing page has a purpose in assisting me during on-boarding with the Etsy API. To better understand this in action, let's look at the handful of essential API management building blocks available on the Etsy home page. When I land at etsy.com/developers/, immediately I&rsquo;m given a Flexible Messaging Area (FMA), telling me what is possible! It is not just one simple message, as I advocate for constantly, it is a slideshow of multiple, simple messages. #winning What Does The API Do? Beyond understand what the Etsy API does in 250 characters or less, I get a prominent link to the API documentation, discussion around the API, and the terms of use for the API&mdash;-BOOM, everything I need. Way to give me exactly what I need so far to get up and running, while also getting out of the way. How Do I On-Board With An API? Next, there is a pretty clear blue highlighted box, that helps me understand the connection between my Etsy seller account, and registering as a developer. I&rsquo;m given what I need to register as a developer, and also configure my Etsy shop for proper integration. Do I Actually Need To Integrate Myself? After than, I&rsquo;m asked if I...[<a href="/2014/12/30/a-refreshing-first-impression-when-you-first-land-in-the-etsy-api-area/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Dec 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m always working to help API providers understand the importance of designing their API developer portals, with a larger audience in mind. Not everyone who visits your portal, will be the one integrating with your API, and providing information for non-developers about the value delivered via API resources, can go a long ways to reach the media, and decision makers at companies who will be potentially be making decision around integrating with a service. I look at a lot of API portals, and always enjoy the ones that speak to the widest possible audience. I also enjoy when there are entire sections dedicated to providing tools and resources for non-developers. One example of this, that I found recently is available over at the transcription and translation platform from Rev, on the page they have dedicated to Zapier. I&rsquo;ve written before about companies referencing their IFTTT and Zapier integration, but I think Rev&rsquo;s approach needs highlight because they provide a full page, with actual links to specific types of integrations. Rev provides some valuable &nbsp;information on what Zapier is, what you can do with Rev and Zapier, and actually walks you through how to actually setup this up, on a page that is given the same prominence as the API documentation (important!). Rev provides you with direct links to put Rev to work, by transcribing from YouTube and Vimeo, and workflows for putting these transcripts on Dropbox, Google Drive or Box. You can click on links that take you to the detail page on Zapier, where you can get up and running with the recipe. I added Zapier as a building block a while back, but I really feel that it is quickly becoming an essential building block, something all providers should be considering in 2015. I think it is really important to provide ready-to-go reciprocity tools for any API platform. I also think it is important to show them alongside API documentation and the other...[<a href="/2014/12/29/zapier-baked-in-by-default-for-the-rev-transcription-api-platform/">Read More</a>]</p>

I had someone ask me, if out of the 30 API reciprocity providers I track on, if I knew if one of them offered white or private label services. I couldn&rsquo;t confidently say whether or not any of them did, and as I do with my other questions, the best way to find out, is to put it out into the universe, and see whether or not one of the providers will let me know, or one of them will do it.
It would make sense for companies like Zapier to offer a solution that would allow for any company to resell their services, and offer specialty versions of their API reciprocity, interoperability, and automation services. As more companies are operating online, spread across various cloud environments, the need for ETL in the cloud, or like I prefer to call them, API reciprocity services, is only going to increase.
Not all companies will want to use a Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, and would prefer operating on-premise, and like to offer the services to their partners, or possibly their customers--opening up the need to brand it themselves. If you know one of the API reciprocity providers that offer anything like this, or plan on doing it, let me know. I have some people who have been asking for it, and would be happy to tell more stories about it.

			<p>I'm reviewing the business models of many of the top API platforms over the last couple of weeks, and I&rsquo;m seeing some pretty interesting approaches to API monetization. As I look through each API, I see that some platforms don&rsquo;t have their API monetization strategy together at all, while others are following the pretty proven &ldquo;cloud utility&rdquo; model handed down from providers like AWS, and then I see some who are continuing to standardize how we pay for, and monetize APIs--which makes me happy. One interesting pricing page I reviewed over the holidays, was from the file conversion API, ConvertAPI. They have a credit based API monetization approach, allowing you to buy a certain amount of credits on a monthly basis, or make one-time basis. Each area offers four tiers, allowing for the purchase of credits at a various rates. One thing I found curious though, is that your credits purchased monthly do not roll over, where your one time purchases do&mdash;I will have to think about the pros / cons of this more, before I comment. The ConvertAPI also has a "credits cost table", providing an overview of how credits actually translate into actual API calls. Many file conversion APIs use a one-to-one rate for making API calls, while others cost 2, 3, or even 5 credits per each API call. I like this approach to defining API costs, and when your API developer account includes a API for monitoring account levels, it starts getting us closer to the API pricing standardization, and the automation we will need to continue the growth of the API economy. I&rsquo;m finding a lot of individual API monetization stories as I go through this latest round of research. I&rsquo;m thinking I will have to spend a couple of weeks in February or March of 2015, step back and look at the monetization strategies of the 700+ companies I&rsquo;m tracking on, and hopefully provide some better analysis of where...[<a href="/2014/12/29/credit-based-api-pricing-with-monthly-and-onetime-plans/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Dec 2014</em></p>
			<p>
As I look through the API efforts of various providers, I&rsquo;m always looking for the little things that can make on-boarding, and sustained integration with an API as frictionless as possible. One of the building blocks that I recommend API providers employ in their operations, is a page that explains API rate limits&mdash;providing vital information on how API resources are throttled (or not).
An improvement on the standard rate limit building block, can be seen at Twitter. Inline in the Twitter API documentation, there are details about rate limiting for that specific endpoint. This way, as you are learning about each endpoint, you can also understand what limitations are in place. A small addition that could prove critical, for any API provider, especially Twitter, who has some of the most complex rate limiting of any API I know of.
At first glance, something small like including rate limit information within each API endpoint documentation may seem insignificant, but think of it like bobsledding or swimming in the olympics, where the slightest adjustment can reduce friction in just the right place&mdash;giving you the competitive advantage you need. Taking a fresh look at the building block(s) Twitter uses around API rate limiting, is expanding my own thoughts on how any API provider can approach their own rate limiting, and represents why I keep an eye on API pioneers like Twitter, even if I don&rsquo;t always agree with 100% of their decisions around platform operations.
P.S. Did you notice the picture is of the rate limiting information, within the rate limit API endpoint? That will be another story, as part of my expansion of thought in the area of rate limiting.

			<p>APIs are a really tough concept to help folks on-board with. I have come to realize that people see APIs very differently, and most of the time, I think this can be a good thing. In a perfect world it would be nice if everyone followed the same standards, and used only the best API patterns, when designing their APIs. This isn't the world we have, and to help better engge within the world we have, I am working to tell stories of this dysfunctional but beautiful API space we have accidently created for ourselves, develop visuals that help us better quantify things, and potentially give little nudges where I can to move things in a better direction. When I hear most technologists talk about APIs, I feel many are exclusively looking through a client / server lens. Your APIs is your backend server architecture, and then your client architecture that will be used to connect APIs to websites, mobile applications, devices, and other systems. When I try to talk about API copyright, projects like API Commons, and APIs.json, or educate folks about modern approaches to API design, deployment, management and integration in this client / server mindset, it can be very difficult to articulate some very important concepts. Not all developers, software architects, and business leaders are familiar with this very important, and the rapidly evolving surface area being defined by API. To help convey some of my thoughts about this very important layer of the API space, I've created some new visuals that I can use in stories, slide decks, and my research reports. First I want to elevate the discussion beyond just client / server architecture, and highlight the importance of the API definition surface area that is present in the middle. When you are designing, developing, managing, and integrating with APIs, you use some very specific languages for developing your server architecture. We use programming languages like PHP, Python, Ruby ,Node.js...[<a href="/2014/12/21/making-sure-the-most-important-layers-of-api-space-stay-open/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m profiling all the 700+ companies I monitor across the space, going through each one and defining their API program, evaluating the tech, business and politics of their operations. Part of this process is creating a Swagger definition for each API. I&rsquo;m not deeply concerned with getting each API definition 100%, unless I'm directly integrating with the aPI. For this round I&rsquo;m looking at defining just the surface area of the API, including each endpoint, headers, parameters, and body format, and leaving the underlying data model for another time. I&rsquo;m publishing all of my API definitions to the API Stack Github repository. I&rsquo;m using this as a staging area before I publish them to APIs.io. Last month I create an APIs.son for 690 APIs, and I&rsquo;m looking to generate as many Swagger definitions for these high value APIs as I can over the holidays. It would be much better if API providers generated, and maintained their own API definitions, but until that happens I&rsquo;m happy doing a little extra work to get us to a critical mass. Feel free to use any of my Swagger specifications, all that I ask is if you update, or add to them, please commit back to the repository so everyone can benefit. Additionally if you have any Swagger definitions for your own APIs, or other public APIs that I do not have in my listings, please share. It is extremely important that all public API endpoints are defined in a machine readable format. I don&rsquo;t care if you use Swagger, API Blueprint or RAML, just make sure your APIs have a definition, and it is shared publicly. If it is one of your designs, make sure and also add to API Commons.

I will be keeping most of the surface area available in current version of the Docker API, but I'm thinking I will add a handful of endpoints, and maybe alter a couple of the existing Docker defined endpoints to better meet my needs. To support my work, I need a Swagger 2.0 definition for the v1.16 of the Docker API. I wish everyone would create machine readable API definitions for their APIs by default, but until that is the norm, I will be creating myself. I&rsquo;m getting pretty good at writing scrape scripts for harvesting API documentation (if they are well formed). This Swagger definition not 100% complete, but here is what I have so far of a Swagger 2.0 representation of the Docker v1.16 API. Its on Github, so if you use this definition, and fix anything, or add parts and pieces i didn't, please submit back, so everyone can benefit from it. I haven't completed the data model for the endpoints, but I'm storing the JSON responses for each endpoint, and just need to set aside some time to finish.

			<p>I recently had a conversation with one of my contacts at a federal agency about a hackathon tour they are planning. The federal government doesn&rsquo;t call these events hackathons, they call them data jams, but for sake of this story I&rsquo;m going to call them hackathons, and also omit the name of the agency until they are ready to talk about the event(s) publicly. This agency had many questions about putting on a hackathon, but one I found particularly interesting, and something that is in line with other concepts I&rsquo;m exploring in the API space, was the desire to assemble a stack of resources that developers could put to use at the event, along with their own agency APIs. They were concerned about hackathon teams coming to the event and having to spend a great deal of time looking for APIs, open data-sets, and tools to use in their projects. Building on top of other stories I've told about being an API broker, I will be putting some thought into how I can possibly act as an API broker for this agency and their hackathon(s). I will set up a Github repository, where I will list agency APIs, as well as bring other relevant government agencies APIs and open data sets. I won&rsquo;t stop there, I will also consider what other private sector APIs, and open tooling that would help attendees be more successful, save time and ultimately rise to the occasion. These thoughts are building on earlier ideas from Cyril Gaillard in his medium post titled "I don&rsquo;t need a business co-founder, I need an API broker". My motivations are all about defining a new breed of evangelists who really understand the API space, and know where to find the best APIs, tools, and other resources. Then these API brokers can use Github to aggregate all relevant APIs, data sources, and tools or services into a single location, saving developers real time and money...[<a href="/2014/12/19/on-being-an-api-broker-for-hackathons/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I have been spending a lot more time in 2014 learning, discussing, and telling stories about hypermedia. Early this year I identified that hypermedia was moving beyond just academic discussion, and entering the mainstream consciousness of the API community. I do not consider myself a hypermedia expert, and had a lot more to learn, and by moving hypermedia further into my regular research, over time this education would come. At the end of 2014, my deep technical knowledge of hypermedia, and the nuances between each of the formats isn&rsquo;t there yet&mdash;I just do not have the production experience with any of them to know what I&rsquo;m doing. I can provide an overview of the technology, the various formats, and the people behind each movement, as well as point to some real world hypermedia implementations, but when it comes to getting down to the details I&rsquo;m just not there yet. One of my readers, from a leading tech company recently emailed me asking for a &ldquo;hypermedia pragmatist&rdquo;&mdash;here is an excerpt: We have a lot of opinions in our organization about how we should implement hypermedia APIs. I&rsquo;d like someone to discuss pros/cons of different approaches in our monthly API discussion group but don&rsquo;t want someone who only promotes one view (i.e., JSON-LD, HAL, etc.) or is extreme in their hypermedia views. Do you know of anyone whom you would consider a hypermedia pragmatist? Someone who understands the competing specs but is pragmatic about how to implement. This describes what I&rsquo;ve set out to be for the API space in general, being a pragmatists in the tech, business, and politics of APIs, and I guess I can "almost" call myself a hypermedia pragmatists, except I just don&rsquo;t have the implementation experience.

			<p><em>18 Dec 2014</em></p>
			<p>I spend a lot of time field questions from people about APIs.json. This is something I expect to be doing for the next 10 years, and happy to field questions about exactly what it is all about, and help educate folks about exactly where APIs.json it fits in to the overall API landscape. A regular comment I get from technologists, and API savvy folks is &ldquo;you know that hypermedia is a better solution for discovery than APIs.json?&rdquo; To which I reply &ldquo;yes I know, but hypermedia is a solution for the API world we want, and APIs.json is a solution for the world we have&rdquo;. I would love it if everyone understood hypermedia, and designed and deployed their APIs with this knowledge in mind&mdash;something I&rsquo;ve spending a lot more time on in 2014, and will continue the push in 2015. In the mean time, I intend to continue stitching apitogether thousands of APIs available out there, using APIs.json, allowing them to be discovered via open source public search engines like APIs.io, private internal search engines, and IDE solutions like Codenvy. We don&rsquo;t just need discovery solutions to find new APIs, we need ways to build collections of high value APIs, something APIs.json excels at. Another thing that APIs.json does, that I don&rsquo;t feel that hypermedia provides a solution to, is the discovery of the other technical, business, and political building blocks like the documentation, code libraries, SDKs, terms of service, and other critical elements of API operations. This an area that APIs.json was specifically defined for, allowing the discovery of these vital areas, in addition to the actual API interfaces. As I do with many of my posts, this one is crafted to be a cookie cutter response to these comments I get regularly about hypermedia vs. APIs.json, allowing me to just reply with a link to this story on my blog. Hopefully we can shift the tide of API deployments in favor of hypermedia,...[<a href="/2014/12/18/do-you-know-that-hypermedia-is-a-better-solution-for-discovery-than-apis-json/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>18 Dec 2014</em></p>
			<p>Most organization I&rsquo;ve worked with, the Excel spreadsheet is the central way of storing, managing and sharing data, with email being the number one way to share these data filled documents. When I was doing data inventory at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), as part of the White House open data initiative, almost every piece of high value data I found was housed in a spreadsheet, and the data stewards who were in charge of this data, would email it to me when I asked for it. To help data stewards go from spreadsheet to API, I wrote an Excel to JSON converter, that was available via a private email address. All you had to do to convert a spreadsheet, was create a new email, attach your spreadsheet to the email, then send it to the specific address, and when it was done processing, you&rsquo;d get an email in response, with links to a CSV, XML, and JSON version of the spreadsheet&mdash;unless it was a super complex spreadsheet of course, but this wasn&rsquo;t our target. Over the last year, this concept has simmered in my brain, and I can&rsquo;t help but think how important both Excel and email are to the onboarding the data that exists across small businesses, the enterprise, organizations, and government agencies. Imagine if you could monitor all the email that flowed within an organization, and look for spreadsheets being emailed back and forth. This would tell you a lot of about how data is stored, managed, and shared across groups. This intelligence could then be used to help direct API efforts, and open data initiatives like the one I participated in within the federal government. I put this idea in my Evernote a couple months back, and tried writing about it a few times, and during a recent flight I added to it. You could go beyond just identifying data usage patterns across a company, you could also generate APIs...[<a href="/2014/12/18/api-service-idea-api-via-excel-from-within-corporate-email/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Dec 2014</em></p>
			<p>I personally depend on over 40 APIs, all of which I have to manage my developer account, apps, and API key access for. This can be a lot of work, and as I continue to add APIs to my stack, this work is only going to grow. Putting on my API broker hat, and thinking about a future, where you will need to gather and organize potentially hundreds of APIs, across multiple companies, things are going to start breaking down if we don't do something to bridge these services. Standard API Developer Accounts First, API onboarding will have to always include a standard API developer account, providing a common data model, and approach to managing developer accounts. Luckily many API platforms use API management providers like 3Scale, so this shouldn't be too much work, but I still come across plenty of APIs who do not even have basic developer account building blocks like analytics, or billing management. I wrote about this, using Google as potential blueprint for how we could possibly standardize developer accounts, and I know that service providers like Auth0 are working to help provide plug and play services that address this as well. API For Developer Accounts I recently wrote about the email API Mallet, a couple of weeks back, and how they have an API for their API developer accounts. This allows users to manage apps, their keys, as well as stay in tune with their API usage, and able to understand when they are hitting their limits, allowing them manage their access tier, and billing information programmatically. Imagine that, an API for accessing account resources?? API providers need to follow their own lead, and make sure all accounts have API by default--all aspects of your API platform should have an API in 2014, there really is no excuse. Automated Account Registration And Key Provisioning. I&rsquo;m always pushing API providers to offer single sign for the creation of API developer accounts,...[<a href="/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Dec 2014</em></p>
			<p>In the coming months I&rsquo;m doing some deep profiling of the API space, so you are going to see me reviewing the approach of more API providers in the space. My goal with API reviews is not just to showcase the company or service involved, but review the overall approach of the provider. You can read more about my review process on API Evangelist, to better understand my objectives. The review in the queue today is from Respoke, a web communications platform. When you land on the Respoke website, you see all the signs of a modern platform, starting with the simple single page app style website, but more importantly, they immediately tell me what they do, in a simple, easy to understand way: Add live voice, video, text, and data features to your website or app You wouldn't believe how hard this is for some of the APIs I review. If I have to spend more than 5 seconds trying to understand what you do, you've failed, and Respoke nails it, by both providing simple text, as well as visuals that help me understand that they are a web communications platform. To continue understanding what Respoke does, let&rsquo;s take a stroll through all of the areas I focus on during any API review. Actual API Endpoints I always start with the actual API endpoints when reviewing an platform. Respoke provides a basic set of endpoints, mostly for authentication of communications via the platform, but also managing roles, groups, etc. You can tell the API is new, and it doesn't have the telltale signs of a fully mature API that has been used for a while, but I know with Respoke, they are just getting going. I&rsquo;m not a fan of using POST, and relying on request data being passed through the body as JSON. I like simple parameter based design, with sensible usage of your verbs. I feel this approach makes an API more...[<a href="/2014/12/04/understanding-more-about-the-web-communications-platform-respoke/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Dec 2014</em></p>
			<p>
This is something I&rsquo;ve written about before in API Sandbox And Simulator From Carvoyant, and Salesforce Adds Sandbox Templates. However it is something I&rsquo;d like to formalize, and get some new API service providers helping out in this area, or encourage the development of open source solutions.
API service providers like Apiary and SmartBear are providing some very interesting solutions for mocking, and virtualizing APIs from API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML. What I would like to see is the emergence of standalone solutions, providing data sets templates, or whatever you want to call it for populating mock APIs for testing, and integration.
Think of it as Lorem Ipsum, but structured data meant specifically for APIs, and specific API definitions, as opposed to static mock content for websites. Seems like you could easily scan a machine readable definition for an API, and see if any existing templates exist that match the definition. If there was you could easily populate the mock or virtualized API, if there wasn't maybe you could provide tools for easily building a template, in a way that it could the data could now be reused.
This idea for API sandbox and simulation templates, and for the Swagger API definition mapper, both were ideas that came up in my conversation with John Musser (@johnmusser). They are ideas I&rsquo;ve had in my Evernote for a while, but bringing them up today reminded me that both ideas needed to see the light of day, and hopefully I can move them forward at some point.

			<p><em>04 Dec 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I was having one of my long overdue check ins with API godfather John Musser today, and it reminded me of an idea I wanted to put out there, so while it was fresh in my mind, I wanted to share. I&rsquo;m applying this to my Swagger driven world, but should be applied to all of the common API definition formats like API Blueprint, and RAML.
I want a machine readable way to map APIs together across multiple Swagger API definitions, mapping a specific API path in one Swagger spec to another API path in an entirely different API definition. Once the paths are connected, you should also be able map specific parameters to each other. It also seems logical that for each mapping you'd want to provide some sort of meta data about the relationship, and maybe some sort of semantics involved also.
Maybe something like this already exists? IDK. I&rsquo;m sure that API reciprocity providers like Zapier probably have their own proprietary approach to handling this, but I&rsquo;m looking for a simple JSON, YAML, or Markdown version of this. If there isn&rsquo;t something like this already out there, I may play around with a prototype. I&rsquo;d like to map similar APIs in my email API research, allowing me to bundle together similar resources.
Not sure how much time I will have for this in 2014, but figured I'd put out there, and see if I've missed something already existing in the space. Also, once something lives on my blog, it becomes a little more real, and the chances increase that I will actually move it forward at some point.

			<p><em>03 Dec 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m playing with more data visualizations lately, trying to establish a dynamic set of tools that I can use in my storytelling across the API Evangelist network. I've been focusing on using D3.js, Google Visualizations, and other JQuery plugins I've gathered over time, for now. During the Turkey Day weekend,&nbsp;I turned a subway map JQuery plugin I had found into an API, and introduced some new ways I can easily use these visualizations in my Hacker Storytelling format of publishing all of my research as Github repositories, using the master branch as a private file and data store, and the Github Pages as the public face of the project. During the proces, I&rsquo;ve added the subway map to my visualization toolbox of JSON driven components that I can use when publishing my stories and research to Github, adding to my already existing tools like jekyll posts &amp; data, mustache templates, and&nbsp;reveal.js slideshows. I've also identified a handful of other visualizations that I want to add to my toolbox, providing a set of tools I can use to publish research reports, that deliver an open, rich, interactive, visualization layer on top of my simple JSON data stores. In reality, this is just my own approach to lightweight application delivery, similar to what we all call Single Page Apps or SPA, except I don't always adhere to a single page, or use a single framework&mdash;I try to keep lightweight, and a decoupled set of tools that I can mix and match to accomplish different objectives. As of this weekend the API Evangelist network is now over a&nbsp;100 separate Github repositories working in concert (or isolation), to help me achieve on my mission to better understand the API space, while hopefully helping others along the way. As I work to assemble my API driven visualization toolkit, I&rsquo;m thinking I will start calling deployments a Single Page Report (SPR).

Here we go again. If you were in Chicago for APIStrat this September, then you know we are planning to have the next edition of APIStrat in Berlin, this spring. This round 3Scale and API Evangelist are partnering with APIDays to deliver two days of API talks at the Humboldt Carr&eacute;, the Conference And Event Centre on Gendarmenmarkt, April 24th and 25th, 2015.
I learned a lot attending APIDays Berlin earlier this year, and I am looking forward to continuing the conversation in 2015, APIStrat style. Our speaker lineup includes&nbsp;Mandy Waite, Developer Advocate at&nbsp;Google Cloud Platform;&nbsp;Chris Taggart, CEO of&nbsp;OpenCorporates; and&nbsp;Max Harlow&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Guardian Open Platform.
Of course we need sponsors to make the conversation happen. APIDays and APIDays can&rsquo;t make it all happen alone. We have some great sponsors who've stepped up early:

Make sure and contact us at [email&#160;protected] to help support the conversation, in Berlin. And like our APIs, APIStrat is powered by 3Scale.

Without the 3Scale team, APIStrat wouldn't happen. As we prepared for the launch of the APIDays Berlin &amp; APIStrat Europe 2015 website, I was reminded that this is the 5th edition of APIStrat, and I think the 8th edition of APIDays, and I can feel that the API space is significantly picking up momentum going into 2015.
I think Germany, and Europe has a very important role to play in helping stabilize, as well as grow the API industry in a sensible, secure way that respects the privacy of the people who are using the apps that are built on the of APIs we are seeing deployed. This is the conversation we will be having in Berlin this spring, and I hope to see you there.

			<p>This story gets file into the &ldquo;way in future&rdquo; bucket, because the infrastructure needed to make happen doesn't even exist. Beyond research from API grandfather John Musser (@johnmusser), and a few other blog posts or conference decks, there is no standardization of monetization strategies and pricing across APIs&mdash;making my idea impossible currently. I won&rsquo;t let that stop me! What I'd like to see is a developer credit system, that I can earn buy or earn credits for any single API, but I possess a credit account across all the APIs I depend on--as an API developer I want to buy credits for API usage, allowing me to buy in single, or bulk amounts, and apply against my regular API usage. As an API provider, I could provide developers with an incentive using credits, trying to drive the behavior I'm looking to get from developers. With a credit system I could even pay developer's credits for doing common API ecosystem tasks like creating code libraries, generating how-to-guides, or even supporting other developers on the forum. If there was a market for API credits, as a developer I could easily earn credits on one platform, and use them there, or possibly apply them to other platforms. I could also choose to just sell my credits on the open market to other API consumers, who might value the credits more than I do, or pay a rate that is lower than they'd get directly from a provider. This is just a random thought I wanted to put out into the universe, that came up as I was evaluating the business models of some APIs I&rsquo;m reviewing. We have a lot of work before something like this would be possible, but if someone stepped up to work on this problem across providers, I think there would be a pretty significant opportunity for them in coming years--think Amazon Web Service pricing, but across the board for the API space, applied...[<a href="/2014/12/02/a-market-for-api-developer-credits/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Dec 2014</em></p>
			<p>Almost every time an API shuts down, the tech blogosphere, and the social networks favored by the tech community erupts in comments resembling: That is what you get for depending on APIs, and APIs can go away at any time, you should know better by now, and you should not build a company on someone elses resources--just to name a few. Where did this line of thought begin? Why do developers feel so burned when a popular API like Netflix, ESPN, or Google Translate is deprecated? The main reason is lack of communication. Developers need a long runway that an API is going to be deprecated. Something that will mitigate much of the backlash, but still the comments are never, why didn't Netflix communicate with us (they did), it is highlighting that APIs can go away at any point. What other business in the world do you have vendors that do not go away? I cannot think of a single business, where you select a supplier of products or services you depend on for your business, without any chance of that company going bankrupt, shutting down, being sold, or possibly just discontinuing providing a particular products or services you depend on. I find it particularly interesting that this is an argument that continues to hold weight, and while you will hear me push back on API providers to communicate better around the deprecation of their APIs, you will never hear me say an API should never shut down, or you shouldn't ever use an API to build applications. Just like any other business area, you should carefully research your vendors, make sensible choices about why you use one over another, and when possible have contingency plans for your operations. I would be curious to hear ideas about the possible origins of why developers feel like this. I can't think of any precedent that would have set this tone for the conversation, and after almost 14...[<a href="/2014/12/01/where-do-developers-get-idea-that-apis-should-never-go-away/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I recently finished looking through all of the email APIs available in the space, narrowing it down to just a handful of companies who I felt were worthy of showcasing as part of my email API research. Ultimately I felt seven were worthy of discussion, and after I laid them side by side all of them were very similar in the technology, business, and politics of their APIs&mdash;all except one, Context.io. Context.io isn&rsquo;t about sending or receiving emails via APIs, or simply focusing on email standards like SMPT, POP, and IMAP. Context.io provides you with storage and indexing of your emails, and then opens up a new API driven world where things are possible you never imagined. Extending upon existing standards like SMTP, POP, and IMAP with APIs like SendGrid has done is cool, but what Context.io has done represents truly thinking out of the box with APIs--which I love to see.. If you haven't noticed, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of evolving legacy standards and technologies using APIs, and I think there is plenty of room for this to occur across many business sectors, and layers of the technology world. I don&rsquo;t think every startup or existing company will have the imagination, or bravery for that matter, to do what Context.io has done, but I applaud their thinking, and would love to see others follow their lead when considering their entry into the API game. Mapping a new set of web APIs to some very legacy processes, in a simple, easy to use way, takes skill and consideration for not just the legacy tech, but also how modern web APis are designed, deployed, managed, and evangelized. Doing the technical, while also deeply considering how people are using this legacy technologies, how they are embedded in our lives and business like email is, and then developing API driven solutions that solve problems for users in these spaces, takes a serious amount of work.

As with anything I do, this is a work in progress, and I&rsquo;m needing to regularly update this map. Currently it is in an image, and I use an image mapping tool to generate the links&mdash;something that is very time consuming. I think the subway map is an important metaphor for understanding some potentially complex ideas, and provide a single map, complete with legends, supporting content, and links to more details. My problem is I have several maps I need to create, and maintain on a regular basis. Ideally my subway mapping tool would be dynamic, allowing me to make changes as I went along. While looking for a solution, I stumbled across Subway Map Visualization jQuery Plugin, by Nik Kalyani. This plugin would work perfectly for what I wanted to do to visualize the API Evangelist network, but I had another project I wanted to do, in which it somewhat fell short in satsifying. There is a lot of talk about the API lifecycle, and I wanted a way to map out the API lifecycle as I saw it, but this concept isn&rsquo;t something there is a single answer for, and I wanted to hear other providers take on their own API lifecycle. I wanted others to potentially build their own API lifecycle subway maps, so I new that the Subway Map plugin needed to be dynamic&mdash;so I wrapped it in a web API. I&rsquo;m still playing with what is possible, but my new&nbsp;Subway Map API allows you to generate maps, adding routes, and locations along the routes. The API just takes advantage of all the features that Nik Kalyani added into the plugin, I just provided web APis for them. This project will be changing fast, and I will be resetting the database...[<a href="/2014/12/01/my-turkey-holiday-project-a-subway-map-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Dec 2014</em></p>
			<p>
As I build out new APIs for use across my systems, as well as map out the landscape of valuable API resources available today, I'm working to define templates that other API providers can follow when designing and deploying their own API infrastructure. I've accumulated 16 basic templates, prompting me to add a new section to the website called templates.
These projects represent the templates I've established through my existing research, and will add other templates as they come off the assembly line. These API designs aren't mean to be the perfect solution for production environements, but to be seeds for new conversation around APIs, as well as providing a basic pattern you can use to start your own development.
Each API is functional, and has its own Github repository for storing of a Swagger definition, Swagger UI Interactive Documentation, as well as the server side code that I will open source with each template. As I move forward each template, I will publish changes to their repos, as well as maintain a roadmap via each projects Github milestones.&nbsp;




&nbsp;




ActionsThis project is a template actions API, mean to demonstrate what is possible with an API. My intention with template APIs is to help onboard folks with new ideas for APIs, and this is one in particular is meant to kickstart the conversation around having a public or private actions API.

			<p><em>24 Nov 2014</em></p>
			<p>
Not all companies who have an API are Twilio, where the API is the product. With Twilio when you land on their website home page, you are in API developer area by default, this is what Twilio does. Many other API driven companies like Twitter, provide link to the API developer program as a link in the footer of the main site, something developers have become accustom to finding.
Many companies I review, don&rsquo;t even have a link prominently listed on their site, forcing me to dig around looking for any evidence of an API. This story isn&rsquo;t about these companies, that is a whole separate post, this story is about the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) and how they have brought their API front and center by having the API present in the top level navigation, and listing their application showcase on their home page. This demonstrates that the DPLA API is something that goes well beyond just being a footnote in operations, and at DPLA it is something that all site visitors should know about--not just developers.
This may not seem like much at first glance, but when it comes to educating visitors of all types, that an API exists, it can be the difference between them knowing their is an API, or not. In 2014, APIs are moving closer to being a part of the mainstream consciousness and you shouldn&rsquo;t have to hide your API. Developers, and non-developers alike should know you have an API. If you want your visitors to potentially integrate with an API, use an application built on your API, or maybe even just spread the word about your API, consider moving it more front and center, giving your API more real estate on your home page, and make it a first class citizen in your site's global navigation.

			<p><em>21 Nov 2014</em></p>
			<p>In the early days, there was just one API design tool to use, Apiary.io. Now at the end of 2014, we have four separate API design tools to choose from. I credit Apiary.io for opening up this new era of API design, expanding the API life cycle, and emphasizing healthy API design practices over just API deployment and management. In my opinion the expansion of APIs design formats, and API design tooling is extremely important to the space, allowing API providers to have conversation around API design with developers, and key business stakeholders, before development actually begins. However, the benefits of healthy API design, using leading API definition formats, goes well beyond just design, and the rewards can be seen throughout the entire API lifecycle. There are three API design tools, from each of the providers of the modern API design formats: Apiary.io - Collaborative design, instant API mock, generated documentation, integrated code samples, debugging and automated testing using the API Blueprint API definition format. API Designer | Anypoint API Portal - Enables the ability to design APIs in the RAML API definition format, and mock, preview and save API designs into a notebook, and integrate with other Mulesoft API tooling. Swagger Editor - Allows the designing APIs in the Swagger format in both YAML and JSON, allowing you to import, edit, preview, and export API design docs. All three of these API design tools are developed by the creator of the leading API definition formats, API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML. (aka. Apiary, Wordnik, and Mulesoft). Now, a significant evolution in the API design tooling space has occurred and a cross format API design tool has emerged from the popular Java API framework Restlet. Restlet Studio - Allows you to create, and load API designs in Swagger and RAML formats, save, and generate server side scaffolding, and client side SDKs in multiple languages. The emergence of the Restlet Studio is significant because it represents the...[<a href="/2014/11/21/there-are-four-api-design-editors-to-choose-from-now/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I was reviewing an API over the last couple of weeks--I signed up for an account, came back several times, and made a handful of API calls in hopes of learning more about how the API works. This is something I do a lot, and it is always interesting to experience the on boarding process (or lack of) for APIs. I first signed up about two weeks ago for this particular API, and within 48 hours I received an email asking if I needed help with my integration--that was nice of them. I like getting an email from the provider, and the more human it is, the better. At this point I didn't need any help, I&rsquo;m just playing, learning, and depending on the self-service resources made available to me via the API ecosystem. About a week later I get another email, again asking if I need help. At this point I&rsquo;ve put down the API, but when I pick back up I might respond to the platform then, but I just have more learning to do before I have questions. Then about a week later, right before I was about to pick up the API again, I got another email asking me what my plans were, putting more pressure on me to share my plans for how I was going to be using an API, which I'm just not sure yet. I am not your usual API consumer. I know this. However this API, I was actually planning on integrating into my core API tracking system at some point, so in addition to being the API Evangelist who might write a story, there is a good chance I will become a customer. I really like, and believe in the self-service nature of APIs, and while I like getting an email letting me know someone is home, I tend to be turned off by each consecutive email--nothing reminds you are in someones sales funnel, like...[<a href="/2014/11/17/sales-onboarding-and-support-in-a-selfservice-api-world/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>12 Nov 2014</em></p>
			<p>
When I landed on the version 3.0 landing page for the Mailjet API, the first thing I noticed was their API configuration API. Providing a set of API endpoints for managing my own API usage is definitely something I can get behind, and think it is something worth showcasing.
As part of the API Configuration portion of their email API, Mailjet provides five separate endpoints for users to manage their API developer account.

/apikey - Manage your Mailjet API Keys. API keys are used as credentials to access the API and SMTP server
/apikeyaccess - Access rights description on API keys for subaccounts/users.
/apikeytotal - Global counts for an API Key, since its creation
/apitoken - Access token for API, used to give access to an API Key in conjunction with our IFrame API
/metadata - Mailjet API metadata

I like this approach to providing developers with API access to their developer account details. It is an approach I&rsquo;d like to explore and standardize using the 3Scale API. I think it is something I've written about before, but I couldn't find it.
API access to a developer account is something I haven't seen anywhere else, but I'll definitely be using Mailjet as a blueprint for demonstrating what is possible, and see if I can&rsquo;t convince other API providers that it is a feature they should consider.

			<p>https://www.eff.org/files/2014/11/07/google_v_oracle_computer-scientists-certpetition-amicus-brief_14-410_final.pdf As the Oracle v Google API copyright case was on its way to the Federal Circuit Court in 2012, the EFF reached out to me for help in crafting stories of how important it is that APIs remain free of copyright, ensuring they remain open and interoperable. I shared three stories, one on cloud computing and AWS APIs, the second on Delicious APIs, and the third on Instagram APIs, all reflecting three different scenarios that would never have happened if APIs were copyrightable. A couple weeks ago EFF reached out again, asking for my signature again, on another Amicus Brief to support Google&rsquo;s request of the Supreme Court to review the circuit courts decision, and reverse it. As it stands right now, there is a precedent that copyright can be applied to APIs, and even though the case itself is moving onto the question of fair use, if we let the current decision stand, other companies can follow Oracle&rsquo;s damaging lead and sue for protection of their APIs--which is why we need to convince the Supreme Court to review, and overturn the very damaging decision.&nbsp; We expect that the Supreme Court will decide whether or not to grant Google&rsquo;s petition to review the Federal Circuit&rsquo;s decision sometime in January or February of 2015. So I need your help to stir up buzz around the issue, and post stories on your blog, call your congressman, and light up any other channel you can, to help educate people about the importance of the issue. When the Supreme Court takes on the case (which I feel strongly they will), we will need to regroup, and refile, a more expansive brief on the importance of APIs remaining free of copyright.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m working to expand my restaurant menu analogy, to help people understand the importance of APIs, but if you have other analogies that you think would help the Supreme Court understand the separation of API interfaces, and their...[<a href="/2014/11/10/my-continued-support-as-signer-of-oracle-v-google-amicus-brief-from-eff/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Nov 2014</em></p>
			<p>
You can find me in San Francisco tomorrow, at the Kabuki Hotel for SF MusicTech. I'm moderating a panel, dubbed &ldquo;API Ecosystem&rdquo;,  where I will be talking APis with Antti Silventoinen (@Lamantiini) of Music Kickup, Justin Woo (@jzwoo) of PayPal / Braintree, Steven Willmott (@njyx) of 3Scale, and Bill Hajjar from Senzari.
I'm planning on walking the panelists through the world of API design, development, management, and focus on API monetization, but I suspect that we'll keep things pretty &nbsp;relevant to the experience, and diversity we will have present on stage. There is &nbsp;a healthy mix of music industry focused providers like Music Kickup, and Senzari (aka Music Graph), but also API architecture provider 3Scale, and payment API pioneer Paypal / payment API startup Braintree.
You can catch the panel tomorrow at 2PM, in the spring room. Let me know if there is anything you'd like me to discuss with Antti, Justing, Steven, and Bill, during the panel. I&rsquo;ll be hanging out at SF Music Tech all day, and of course drinking beers in SF tomorrow evening--let me know if you want get together and talk APIs!

I've been crafting Swagger 2.0 definitions for many of the leading APIs i track on lately, and to help alleviate my pain and suffering, I&rsquo;m willing to write about your company if you write your own Swagger 2.0 spec. I&rsquo;m sorry, this is really important work, but it can be very grueling detail work, and I'd really like your help!
If you send me a 80% complete Swagger 2.0 specification, or for that matter, an API Blueprint or RAML specification, I will review your API efforts on the API Evangelist blog. I'm pretty adamant that all APIs today should have a machine readable definition in a popular format like Swagger or API Blueprint, as well as each API developer program possessing an APIs.son index of all of their APIs, including a reference to the machine readable API definition.
I&rsquo;m determined to hand craft machine readable Swagger specs for the best APIs out there, and in time I will do this, but I could really use the help of API providers as well. Send me a link to your Swagger spec, and I&rsquo;ll make sure a story gets into my story queue. I would add a disclaimer, that you need to make sure your API offers value, and your overall effort is thoughtful, otherwise I may call you out on some things. :-)
Once we get to a point where all APIs have a machine readable definition, we will start seeing entirely new opportunities around API design, deployment, management, integration, and discovery. I'm determined to bootstrap the work that will help us get to this point, but damn, I sure need some help. Tweet at me, or feel free to email me a link to any machine readable API definitions that you know of. #thanks

			<p><em>10 Nov 2014</em></p>
			<p>
It always makes me happy to see a pricing page, front and center when I visit an API, but I found an added bonus over at the email API, Inbox. At the bottom of their pricing page, they have a pretty simple question: Hey, why isn't this free?

It&rsquo;s become painfully clear in the past few years that if you&rsquo;re not paying for something, you&rsquo;re the product. In practice, this has resulted in &ldquo;free&rdquo; platforms that eventually were forced to show ads, sell user data, or fire-sale to a large company to only be unloved or shut-down.
We&rsquo;re taking a different approach. The Inbox API isn&rsquo;t free. You pay us, and we run the service. That&rsquo;s it.
We know our pricing might still be prohibitive to some apps getting started. If you&rsquo;re a startup building on the Inbox Platform, please get in touch by emailing [email&#160;protected]

I like their style. I just don't understand the smoke &amp; mirrors when it comes to pricing in the API space, and fully support API providers who offer no B.S. pricing for their API resources.
It is little things like this that keep me trolling through the developer areas, and back alleys of the API space each day.

			<p>I&rsquo;m lost in API monetization land, evaluating the business models of common APIs, so you are just going to have to cope with it, until I get through this research. Honestly, I really don't care this much about making money off of APIs, it is just telling me a lot about the motivations behind many of the APIs I keep an eye on. This particular story is extracted from my research into the monetization strategies of multiple core business sectors in the API space, and one of my regular conversations that I have, with an API provider around how they can settle in on a sensible monetization strategy. In the same conversation around how these valuable resources even became APIs, we were immediately led to the topic of what we were going to charge for, and how we were going make money off these potentially resources. As I&rsquo;m discussing resources based API design, I&rsquo;m also having a resource based API monetization conversation&mdash;which tells me we are so lost in the infancy of all areas of API design, deployment, management, and ultimately monetization. How these resources are going to be used? How will these API resources actually be put to use by end-users within web, mobile, and IoT applications? Seems like we should be considering the perspectives on how people will experience these APIs as we design the interfaces, let alone before we attach prices to them. If we don&rsquo;t know ho they will be used, how will we ever know what someone will pay for them? I just don't know the answer. I know that we have hard costs for crafting these API resources--the compute, storage, and bandwidth to serve them up. I do not know if anyone will even pay a dime for any of them, or even need them at all. Where do I focus?

			<p>I spend my time gathering what I call b"uilding blocks",&nbsp;as I work my way through the API landscape. I&rsquo;ve been tracking on the building blocks of API management since 2011, and have expanded that to include API design, deployment, evangelism, integration and other areas of the API lifecycle in the last 3 years. I'm working my way through the 700 APIs in my API stack, I am looking for industry focused building building blocks, as well as the ones associated with an APIs business model, or monetization strategy. I have almost twenty monetization building blocks I'm tracking on ranging from free access to the availability of partner programs. As I work my way through various business sectors being impacted by APIs, I'm starting to see interesting patterns, some of which can act as a red flag for me that there are potential problems within an API operations. To the uneducated API pundit, the illnesses around APIs arise from simplistic concepts like &ldquo;being public&rdquo;, when in reality there are deeper issues at play, usually around the business model, and these patterns for me begin to really get at the root of the problem, rather than just speculating on the cause. An example of this has to do with the existence of a handful of management and monetization building blocks, and the absence of others--such as when an API does not have a pricing page, service tiers, or any paid infrastructure, but offers free access to an API. This is amplified when a provider also doesn't provide any clear rate limiting available, resulting in a service you do not want to depend on, because I can guarantee buried in the terms of service is a clause that they can start charging at any moment. The most well known example of this in the wild is Twitter, who despite having Gnip and DataSift, still does not provide clear and scalable pricing options for its developer.

			<p><em>05 Nov 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I wrote a story about a company I&rsquo;m advising for last week called Codenvy, who is delivering modular, scalable, cloud development environments using their web IDE and Docker. I'm currently working my way through the spreadsheet to API, and API to spreadsheet solutions I track on, and it is making me think that someone should deliver a Codenvy-like containerized spreadsheet environment.
With this type of environment you could forever end the emailing of spreadsheets, allowing people to craft spreadsheets, complete with all the data and visualization goodness they desire, and clone, fork, share, and collaborate around these containerized spreadsheets. You could have a library of master planned spreadsheets that your company depends on, and manage user permissions, analytics, and even scalability, performance, and distribution of vital spreadsheets.
Using this platform you could easily spawn spreadsheet driven APis using services like API Spark, and you could come full circle and have spreadsheets that obtain their data directly from valuable API driven resources, to really blow your mind. Personally I'm not a big spreadsheet lover, but I do recognize that it is where a majority of the worlds data resides, and the user interface of choice for many business folk--making it a good candidate for the next generation of containerized API data sources, and clients.
Just another one of my random ideas that accumulate in my Evernote, that I'll never have time to build myself, and hoping you will tackle for me. As I review all of the existing spreadsheet APi solutions available currently, I&rsquo;m sure I'll have more API centric, spreadsheet ideas bubble over t o share with you.

			<p><em>05 Nov 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I found the DNS implementation over at the Messente SMS API interesting, and worth of sharing for deeper evaluation. I've been considering the various approaches by API providers when crafting their domains, or subdomains for API access heavily over the last couple weeks.
During some research time today I stumbled across the Messente SMS API which opts to provide two domains for making HTTP(S) requests of their API:

api2.messente.com
api3.messente.com

Messente provides a little disclaimer to handle the developer side of manual load-balancing these API calls:
These two domains have the same final destination regarding the API functions. In order to ensure that your requests always reach Messente API services, please use one of them as primary and the second one as backup. Both API domains work as equal, but in case of any unexpected downtime with one of them (HTTP 5xx), the other one must be used on client side.
I'm not sure this manual approach to providing API endpoints is the optimal path when delivering on the stability of your API, let alone the location of your resources, but it does provide an interesting contrast on the perspectives that are available out there in API-land.
Sometimes I feel like I should rebrand as API Anthropologist, as I find the approach of my fellow API providers more interesting than what I'd expect to find in a mature API landscape. This reflects the importance of showcasing what is going on, to help bridge to where we should be, rather than focusing exclusively on where we should be. (deep shit, man)

			<p>This is a guest post from one of our sponsors. We actually cringed, and puked in our mouth a little bit when we saw an email come in from this company, requesting a post, but they paid us well, and we knew the topic would generate an insane amount of page views, so what the hell&mdash;we can drink more so we can sleep at night. Our company didn't actually write this post, we just grabbed it from a blog that we regularly read, written by someone who actually understands the topic. This approach is much more beneficial to us, as we don't actually have to have any creativity, or skill, and it doesn't cost us a dime! #winning When we found this post, it had an informative title, but for the purposes of this guest post we changed the title a little bit, in an effort to make it more desirable, clickable, and shareable by our readers.&nbsp; This post also had a lot more context when we found it, but for the purposes of this guest post we are going to remove most of that context. We also want to make sure and not cite the author, and potentially provide any unnecessary background--well maybe a Twitter account so people can spew venom at them. All of this goes along way in making sure the article invokes the passion we are looking to generate, which will result in the volume of traffic we desire. Once this is posted, we will syndicate to the places on the Internet where the worst people you can imagine dwell. This is the tech industry, so there are some pretty proven places to go to find these types of folks. These people don&rsquo;t represent the entire Internet, but because they are so outspoken, you'd think they do.

			<p><em>05 Nov 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m digging deeper into my Evernote lately, getting back to those half written stories I have laying around, and next up is about the Carvoyant API sandbox and simulator. I came across their Free #connectedcar data candy in the Sandbox blog post, and was intrigued by the concept of a simulator, not just for IoT related APIs, but potentially for any API.
Carvoyant provides a free API account which comes with a sandbox API for playing with the platform, and a traffic simulator that allows you generate vehicle and trip data for use in developing applications. I can see how a sandbox plus simulator is essential for developing automotive related applications, as you can&rsquo;t be expected to have real car connection and data in all scenarios, something clearly Carvoyant has put a lot of thought, and work into.
Providing an API sandbox plus API simulator seems like it could also be two essential building blocks required for all device based API platforms, aka Internet of Things. This approach would be significant in on boarding new developers, providing them with immediate scenarios they can hack against, to learn about an API, as well as light the fire within their imagination regarding what is possible with the platform's API.
I already have a sandbox as one potential API management building block that API providers should consider. I think I will also add a simulator to the API management building blocks, and keep an eye out for other API simulators in the wild. I know I&rsquo;ve covered sandbox templates from SaleForce in the past, but usually once I&rsquo;ve seen something in the wild a couple of times, and add it as a formal building block to track on, I immediately tend see more of it out in the space. Have you seen any cool API simulators?

			<p><em>04 Nov 2014</em></p>
			<p>
One pattern I'm seeing emerge on some of the API platforms I&rsquo;m watching from week to week are integration pages, showcasing the other 3rd party services than an API has integration with. An integration page is similar to an application showcase, but instead of showing apps build on an API, you are showcasing other platforms that are already integrated with.
A recent one that I&rsquo;ve seen out in the wild is from web development annotation platform Usersnap, showing the platforms they connect to:

The second I came across was from OpsGenie, the alerts and notification platform, showcasing all of the common platform they work with:

I&rsquo;m going to add an integrations page to my list of API management building blocks for API providers to consider. An integration page can showcase a wide range of integrations that introduce reciprocity into platform operations. Integrations could start with using Zapier, but could also be seamless, providing plug and play connectors for users. I would say integrations goes right up to what I call platform development kits (PDK), which would be open source code that developers could use to get up and running on 3rd party platforms.
If you don't have any existing integrations to showcase, I recommend spending some time and figure out the top 5 platforms that would complement the value delivered by your API, and get to work integrating. Existing API integrations are great for stimulating the imagination of developers, as well as provide ready to go solutions for non-developers--either way an integrations page will help onboard new API consumers.

			<p><em>04 Nov 2014</em></p>
			<p>As I write up a story on Magnet, another one of the API SDK service providers to emerge in the space, I can't help but evaluate what other building blocks have the potential to evovolve, and be offered as a specific service. Machine readable API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint make services like Apimatic and Magnet possible, and I enjoy thinking about other potential services that could be easily generated from definitions in this way. One possiblity that comes to mind is server side scaffolding, and the possibilities of generating server side scaffolding for your APIs in a variety open source API frameworks, using machine readable definitions. It is difficult to generate 100% of the server side of an API using machine readable API definitions, but you sure can go a long way in auto generating a scaffolding that will get you most of the way there. I&rsquo;m picturing a whole library of every REST framework known to man (and woman), and the ability to select framework, and upload a machine readable Swagger specification, and the service generates a zip file, or publishes to Github for you. The service would save you the time of going out and finding the latest version of your favorite (or clients) REST framework, and do most of the heavy lifting in setting up, configuring, and crafting API endpoints. Eventually you might think about other ways to distribute, like docker containers on AWS, Google, and even PaaS services like Heroku. It would be easy to use APIs.io, and the APIs.json files to find API design patterns, and make those available in a library alongside all of the available REST frameworks. I would build this myself, but I just don't have time, and it isn&rsquo;t an idea I think anyone is going to get rich off of, but I think you could make a good living charging a couple bucks to generate server side API scaffolding, and keep tabs...[<a href="/2014/11/04/project-idea-server-side-api-deployment-using-open-source-api-frameworks/">Read More</a>]</p>
