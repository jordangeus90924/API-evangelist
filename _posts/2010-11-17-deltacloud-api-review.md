Deltacloud currently supports seven major cloud computing platforms including [Rackspace][2] and [Amazon EC2][3].

The Deltacloud API delivers a RESTful API using HTTP Authentication. The web service provides access to hardware profiles, realms, images, and instances. It provides a Ruby client, but no other language kits.

Building Blocks:

  * Drivers
  * Framework
  * Ruby Client
  * Image Builder
The Deltacloud API is free and open source and is available under the LGPL and GPL and licenses.
