I've spent a lot of time lately looking for new tools that will help you plan, develop, deploy and manage APIs.  My goal is to keep refining the [API Evangelist Tool][1] section to provide complete API tool directory you can filter by language or other tag.  

I've added a number of open source tools to my database lately.  But I know there are many more out  there.  So I put out on the Twitterz that I was looking for anything that is missing. Here is what I got:

> @[kinlane][2] [runscope.com/oauth_tool][3]

> @[kinlane][2] @[darrel_miller][16] in that case, Charles Proxy too

Resulting in the following tools being suggested:

[<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-tools/Carte-Logo.png" alt="" width="150" />][18]
**[Carte][18]** \- Carte is a simple Jekyll based documentation website for APIs. It is designed as a boilerplate to build your own documentation and is heavily inspired from Swagger and I/O docs. Fork it, add specifications for your APIs calls and customize the theme. Go ahead, see if we care.

[<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-tools/Charles-Proxy-Logo.png" alt="" width="150" />][19]
**[Charles Proxy][19]** \- Charles is an HTTP proxy / HTTP monitor / Reverse Proxy that enables a developer to view all of the HTTP and SSL / HTTPS traffic between their machine and the Internet. This includes requests, responses and the HTTP headers (which contain the cookies and caching information).

[<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-tools/fiddler-logo.png" alt="" width="150" />][20]
**[Fiddler][20]** \- Fiddler is a Web Debugging Proxy which logs all HTTP(S) traffic between your computer and the Internet. Fiddler allows you to inspect traffic, set breakpoints, and "fiddle" with incoming or outgoing data. Fiddler includes a powerful event-based scripting subsystem, and can be extended using any .NET language.

[<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-tools/foauth-logo.png" alt="" width="150" />][21]
**[foauth.org: OAuth for one][21]** \- OAuth is a great idea for interaction between big sites with lots of users. But, as one of those users, it’s a pretty terrible way to get at your own data. That’s where foauth.org comes in, giving you access to these services in three easy steps.

[<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-tools/hurl-logo.png" alt="" width="150" />][22]
**[Hurl][22]** \- Hurl makes HTTP requests. Enter a URL, set some headers, view the response, then share it with others. Perfect for demoing and debugging APIs.

[<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-tools/httpbin-logo.png" alt="" width="150" />][23]
**[httpbin: HTTP Request ][23]**
