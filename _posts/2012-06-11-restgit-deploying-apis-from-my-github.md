{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have a workflow for dealing with the steady stream of ideas that fly out of my arse on a daily basis.First, I write them all down in Evernote.If an idea sticks with me and keeps nagging on me in the back of my mind, I usually give it a place on the internal wiki that I use for managing my world.Then if an idea sits on the wiki for over a year and I havenâ€™t finished building it, and successfully deployed or integrated into my platform--I set it free.The one year expiration date has come for one of my ideas, and I want to publish here so maybe someone else will run with it.</p>
