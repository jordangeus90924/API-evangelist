        <span class="post-date">03 Mar 2016</span>
        <p>As I look through API portals, profiling the building blocks of successful API platform, I'm always looking for bite-size stories for my readers. I was working to complete my Instagram API definition, as part of <a href="http://photos.stack.network/">my photo API research</a>, and their getting started graphic caught my attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/developer/">This three step getting started visual for Instagram is prominently available on the home page</a>, providing a very distilled down version of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">what I recommend API providers usually accomplish with a dedicated getting started page</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/developer/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Instagram-Developer-Getting-Started.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></a></p>
<p>The featured getting started area provides you with the link to register your application, and overview on authentication and authorization, and a link to all the endpoints, so you can start making requests. I am a big fan of there always being a dedicated getting started page for APIs that I am on-boarding with, but I am always a bigger fan when someone distills these building blocks into something that is way easier to understand, and execute--without all the blah blah blah.</p>
<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">I'm going to consider adding a feature getting started building block, in addition to having the dedicated page</a>. When done right, I think they can accomplsh the same thing, but with one less click--reducing any friction we possibly can in the on-boarding process.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Mar 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-rocket.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />I have had several conversations with API providers lately who are somewhat frustrated with the way their API operations are going. While their APIs have brought in many new conversations, and supported some interesting integration, they haven't been the business driver that they had hoped when they kicked off their API efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many reasons why API efforts may not live up to the hype, mostly its because I think we raise the bar too high in Silicon Valley. We raise up the Amazon's and Twilio's up in our mind as models we want follow, and talk about API success in terms of number of users, and in billions of API calls--as just a couple of examples. I will be the first to admit that many of us pundits have over hyped, and is something I've been working to filter out of my storytelling over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>The people I am having conversations with admit that an API is necessary, and wouldn't dream of getting rid of their API effort, but are just wrestling with the fact that the API just didn't end up be the business driver like they expected. In most of these conversations, APIs are just having to play second fiddle to traditional business elements like sales, marketing, education, support, and many of the other more mundane, fundamental aspects of business operations.</p>
<p>While I can talk through these companies API strategy, to see where I can make suggestions, but in the end, an API is just one of the tools in your business toolbox. Your next customer most likely will not be making their way through your sales funnel simply because you have an API. It may be one important consideration, and almost certainly will come up down the road, but most likely will not be the conversation starter everyone hopes it will be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not want to throw a wet blanket on your API enthusiasm. You need to keep up the hard work of making sure your API is available, evolving, and community driven, but make sure you set your expectations properly, regarding how long of a road you actually have. Like a website, an API will be an essential tool in your business toolbox. You simply will not be able to do some business without an API in the future, but it does not trump many other more tangible aspects of your business like value, sales, marketing, and support.</p>
<p>If you are feeling the same way with your program, feel free to let reach out. While I feel we all may have set our expectations a little higher than was logical, I also think feeling like this is an important part of the API journey itself. It is a long, long, long road. I know I lose faith in API Evangelist on a regular basis, and after five years I have to come up with creative ways to keep engaging in new conversations, and telling stories of what is working, and what is not--sometimes it just helps to talk with folks about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2016/03/01/google-has-redesigned-its-developer-policies-with-clearer-language-and-visual-examples/">The NextWeb had a great story today that&nbsp;Google has redesigned its developer policies with clearer language and visual examples</a>, and normally I don't jsut parrot what the tech blogosphere publishes, but it's an important enough API message, I think it warrants repeating. In my experience, API providers just emulate what they hear in the space, and stories like this need amplifcation.</p>
<p>What Google did isn't rocket surgery, they just <a href="https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html">simplified the legalize around what they expect of developers</a>. What better way to actually help ensure these best practices around the platform actual happen, then by actually providing simple titles, summary description, images, and other relevant links, on a developer policy page. In most scenarios developers aren't malicious, they are just usually ignorant of the best practices that often exist in the platforms legalize we agree to, but seldom ever read.</p>
<p>My friend Tyler Singletary (<a href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>)&nbsp;stated that, <em>"the organization here for policy is fun, mostly clear, and interactive. A company the size of Google distilling the deep TOS policy into such a user and developer friendly front end is pretty astounding.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;-- I agree. Simple like this, when you operate at Google scale can be pretty hard, and is somthing I'd love see standardized across Google offerings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will be adding any of the elements from <a href="https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html">the simplified Google Play developer policy</a> that are missing in my API <a href="http://terms-of-service.apievangelist.com/">terms of service</a>, <a href="http://privacy.apievangelist.com/">privacy</a>, <a href="http://licensing.apievangelist.com/">licensing</a>, and <a href="http://branding.apievangelist.com/">branding</a> research. I will also add the concept of having visuals for each area, or building block, and add the common them of "keep it simple", helping API providers remember that they actually want developers reading and understanding this stuff, not having it buried in the legaleze that nobody will give shit about.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://small-business-api-strategy.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-business-of-apis.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/15/all-this-information-is-great-but-where-do-i-start-with-my-api-strategy/">I've been moving forward with my efforts to better on-board folks with the sometimes overwhelming amounts of research available via API Evangelist</a>. I have several groups looking for guidance on where to start with their strategy, as well as develop some lower level tactical approaches to propelling themselves forward in their API journey. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/18/taking-a-snapshot-of-just-the-essential-api-building-blocks-across-my-research/">I recently posted a master list of my essential building blocks across, 20+ areas of my research</a>, and now I'm <a href="http://small-business-api-strategy.apievangelist.com/">distilling these into a single project to help me move forward as one potential operational API strategy for a small businesses</a>.</p>
<p>First i took the almost <a href="http://apievangelist.com">1000 building blocks I've organized across my areas of API research</a>, and added a question for each, which simply asks where things are with each of these potential considerations along the API life cycle. For this particular small business API strategy, I've opted to include discovery, definitions, design, hypermedia, DNS, deployment, virtualization, containers, management, documentation, SDK, embeddable, real time, webhooks, support, monitoring, testing, road map, authentication, security, terms of service, privacy, licensing, branding, monetization, plans, partners, and evangelism, covering 28 areas of the API life cycle that would be relevant to a small business.</p>
<p>The result is a pretty comprehensive API strategy that might help a small business adopt a more coherent framework for their own efforts--the problem is this can still be very high level thinking, and difficult to know where to get going on day one, what to do when you launch a new API, and other more tactical aspects of API operations. &nbsp;To help me bring such a large, lofty API strategy down into the tactical weeds, I'm going to be applying it to my own, existing operations, and deriving a handful of tactical implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day One -</strong> Where do we begin, even with a legacy mess of systems, services, web services, and APIs?</li>
<li><strong>New Portal -</strong> We need to launch our first portal, or possibly a new product, service, or group portal to support API operations.</li>
<li><strong>New API -</strong> Wanting to kick off a new API, what should we be considering, and including in overall approach from design to management?</li>
<li><strong>API Launch - </strong>Week of, day, off the launch for the new API, what should we be considering, from making sure monitors are up, to publishing a blog post.</li>
<li><strong>Evangelism -</strong> What should be done regarding evangelism and outreach, across all areas of platform operations, giving me a single list of what I should be doing.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly -</strong> What are my weekly considerations to help me course correct what I'm doing on the ground with my overall API strategy?</li>
<li><strong>Monthly&nbsp;- </strong>What are my monthly considerations to help me course correct what I'm doing on the ground with my overall API strategy?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://small-business-api-strategy.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-strategy.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>These are just six of the tactical areas I could use help with in my own operations, and are the key areas some of the organizations I'm talking with are looking for guidance as well. My objective is to establish a high level API strategy that a small business could apply to the 100K level, but also have lower level plans that can help small businesses get started on day one, launch their developer portals, establish a design first process that can be applied to any new APIs, and successfully launch new API efforts. I also threw in a general weekly, and monthly version as well, just to deal with the mundane aspects of API operations that we all kind of suck at--I know I do!</p>
<p>In this API strategy, building block, and question blueprint I've crafted, no tactical element can exist without being rooted in an overall strategic objective. My strategy goes well beyond being just an API design guide--it is meant to be my API operations guide, with tactical plays that are all in sync with my overall goals. As with everything on my API workbench, this <a href="http://small-business-api-strategy.apievangelist.com/index.html">small business APi strategy</a> is ever evolving. I'm adding in more building blocks, and asking more questions as I actually apply to my own API operations, and those of folks I'm talking to, so check back often.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with adding more building blocks, and questions to my strategy, I'm also planning on making it interactive, so you can actually answer the questions posed, and save within a public or private Github repository. This will allow anyone to come back often, and add to, or refine an API strategy. My API strategy tooling will possess a tactical plan manager, allowing for the creation of collections in these area, which can provide a framework for designing and deploying new APIs, surges in my API evangelism, or any of the other fast moving, ever changing aspects of API operations--all while keeping everything anchored in a big picture API strategy.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Feb 2016</span>

<p>I need some help with APIs! Ok, where can I help you? Well, I have multiple systems, that we use to operate our business on a daily basis, and when we do things in one system, we need the other system to know about it, and when certain events occur we need to trigger pushes or pulls between all systems--this is how many conversations begin as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>While many people think they are looking for an API solution, they are really looking for an API journey, with a little assistance from me along the way. Sure they want an API to make their world more integrated, inter-operable, automated, and real time, but in reality, they are needing to get to work unwinding a mess of legacy technical, business, and political business decisions that have been over years--this takes a journey.</p>
<p>Ok, so where do we get started (another common theme lately) in helping quantify the problem set, and what a journey will look like to get us closer to a solution? This post is designed to help you self assess, answer a handful of key questions, and put yourself on a path forward.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Systems Inventory</strong><br />What systems are involved? If this is a company-wide effort, this might be a more involved task, but if it is a single project, or objective, it will hopefully be much smaller. Regardless of scope, having a well defined inventory of the internal systems that you depend on, is pretty important stuff. Let's get to list making a list of what systems are involved in the API driven solution we are looking for.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Below for Each System-------------</em></li>
<li>What is the system name?&nbsp;</li>
<li>What is the public URL of the website for the system?</li>
<li>Are there API opportunities surrounding this system?</li>
<li>Who is the internal owner and contact for the system?</li>
<li>What is the systems used for?</li>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Above for Each System-------------</em></li>
</ul>
<p>For this exercise we are going to limit this grouping to internal or on-premise systems that we are running, because it is likely they'll reflect an earlier, non HTTP-centric way of doing business (not always, but usually). Ideally there is an API already in place, or there are web services, file imports and exports, or other means information portability, but these systems will usually have to be evaluated separately from the newer, more cloud-based services, which more often have a more coherent API approach.</p>
<p><strong>External Cloud Services Inventory</strong><br />Similar to the internal assessment above, what external services are involved in this solution. Try to think of all the existing services that are used, need information pushed to it, or even possibly new services that could be put to work, if this newer process was in place. Let's make a list of what cloud services are involved in the API driven solution we are looking for.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Below for Each Service-------------</em></li>
<li>What is the service name?&nbsp;</li>
<li>What is the public URL of the website for the system?</li>
<li>Are there API opportunities surrounding this system?</li>
<li>Who is the internal owner and contact for the system?</li>
<li>What is the systems used for?</li>
<li>Is the system a paid or free service?</li>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Above for Each Service-------------</em></li>
</ul>
<p>It is likely that these services will have some sort of API opportunity, but if not, there are often APIs right below the surface if you just ask, and in some cases, it will set into motion and API journey for the service provider as well (#winning). Knowing the services you depend on is just good for business, and having them in an organized list should be part of your regular operations.</p>
<p><strong>Tools In The Toolbox</strong><br />Let's do what we just did for internal systems, and cloud services, but this time for the open tooling put to work. Like internal systems don't always resemble newer cloud services, open source tooling also have different considerations, and varying ways in which they can be applied.&nbsp;Let's make a list of what open source tooling is involved in delivering on the API driven solution we are manifesting here:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Below for Each Tool-------</em></li>
<li>What is the tool name?&nbsp;</li>
<li>What is the public website or repository for the tool?</li>
<li>Are there API opportunities surrounding this tool?</li>
<li>Who is the internal owner and contact for the tool?</li>
<li>What is the tool used for?</li>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Above for Each&nbsp;Tool-------</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Also consider including open source tooling that you'd like to see added to the mix. Maybe you are just looking to replace an existing internal system, or possibly a 3rd party service you are depending on, with an open source solution. Let's get to work putting together a master list of all the open tooling at play in this project.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying the Objects That Are In Play</strong><br />Database folks will simply focus on the schema aspect of this, but as a database administrator with over 25 years of experience, this is more about the human side of the object vs the database resource dimension of it. When it comes to identifying the ojbects that are in play, I'm looking for the meaningful nouns that are part of this personal, business, or other scenario being tackled as part of this project. What are all the parts and pieces being moved around like contact record, images, documents, and even down to the micro level with tags and categories?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Below for Each Object-------</em></li>
<li>What is the object name?&nbsp;</li>
<li>How many of the objects are in play?</li>
<li>What are other characteristics of this object?</li>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Above for Each&nbsp;Object-------</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These objects are the digital assets of any company, organization, institution, and individual. These are the bits &amp; bytes you want kept in sync, so you can make decision, sell products &amp; services, and just operate on a daily basis. A well defined dictionary of these objects should exist, so that their storage, transmission, syndication, sharing and other aspects can be tracked in detail.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who Are The Key Actors Involved With The Process?</strong><br />Now we are getting to the very import human aspect of this assessment. Who are the people involved in this process? I am not just talking about the developers or system administrators who will be involved, I am talking about business, and partner stakeholders, system users, and even the operators of 3rd party API providers. Let's compile a list of who will be touched by any part of this:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Below for Each Actor--------</em></li>
<li>What is the individual or group name?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Provide a description of each individual, or group, and their relationship and needs?</li>
<li>How large are the groups of actors?</li>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Above for Each&nbsp;Actor-------</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These actors are the central focus of this effort, with the systems, services, tooling, and objects always playing second fiddle. Ultimately this is all about alleviating the frustrations of actors, deliver better products, services, provide support, and improve web, mobile, and other API driven applications that they are using.</p>
<p><strong>What Actions Are Being Taken?</strong><br />The last piece of this assessment, is what actions will be taken? What are the specific actions that are needed to satisfy this effort, that is keeping systems in sync, putting internal or 3rd party APIs to use in an existing system, or possibly what is satisfied by a new API or piece of open source software. We need a list of meaningful actions you are looking for, including which of the key actors involved, putting the systems, tools, and services broken out above to work. Feel free to break them down by any logical grouping, and be sure to be as details as you feel necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Below for Each Action-------</em></li>
<li>Short title for the action</li>
<li>Provide a concise description of the action</li>
<li>What systems, tools, or services are touched?</li>
<li>Which objects will be play a role in the action?</li>
<li>Which actors will be triggering or impacted by action?</li>
<li><em>-------Copy / Repeat Above for Each&nbsp;Action-------</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These actions should be n plain English--no translation need. This isn't an IT project, this is a human led process, trying to satisfy a specific need you (they) have. You may not full understand which system, service, or tool that will apply, so focus on describing the specific goal, and need--the rest will come later. Realization of these actions is why we are doing this, and having them well documented helps ensure we can push them forward in future iterations, and integration.</p>
<p><strong>This Should Provide A Basic Assessment To Get Started On The Journey</strong><br />These are all the moving parts involved. Hopefully this outline provides you a little taste of what the actual API journey may look like. API is more about understanding the systems you depend on, the resources at play, and the consumers involved, than it really ever is about the API. An API is just the enabler, allowing us to talk through the systems, services, tooling, processes, and establish a better understanding of the transactions that need to occur, both synchronous, and asynchronously, to meet the needs of everyone involved.</p>
<p>Whats next? Well that depends on the completeness of this assessment, and the API opportunity that exists with the systems, services, and tools being used--not all will be conducive to integration, interoperability, and automation, for a variety of technical, business, and politics reasons. However, before we can make this assessment, we need to take a snapshot all the moving parts, and better understand what the end play might be. This should get things going, and with the detail you provide here, you (we) should be able to better communicate these needs to any 3rd party, that might be helping move things forward.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-extraction.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" />I often <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/29/parse-shutting-down-maybe-we-should-lower-our-expectations-of-tech-just-a-little-bit/">push back against API consumers</a> when they complain about the deprecation of API platform, focusing on the fact that we cannot depend on APIs to be around forever. I also push back against API providers when they express concern around having to support developers forever, for fear of revolt in the community. I think the rational folks in the space understand that a balance is needed in these situations, but alas, there are always new incidents that make us go WTF?? <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/26/how-not-to-run-a-platform/">I was reading about Venmo halting new developer access to its API from Techcrunch today</a>, which left me shaking my head, saying damn, damn, damn.</p>
<p>I know a lot of you are invested in the startup game, and in all honesty, I am too. A lot of my income comes from startsup, who have taken VC money. I want to believe there can be an ethical path forward in all of this, and it is not all just gambling by a bunch rich white dudes who don't give a shit, but it is getting harder and harder to do. Venmo gained a lot of traction with the support of its API and its developer community, and to just turn off the spigot after riding on the backs of its API and community is just exploitation. I'm not saying they can't shut down their program--I am saying the are obligated to communicate better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In several conversations with folks today, the topic of a ranking system for API providers came up again, with some sort of rating for good and providers, as well as some sort of warning system to alert developers ahead of time, that an API is stumbling. This is something I've been working on for a while, and will keeping working on, with my partners. While I think such a system could help us identify some bad actors early, and incentivize others to think through their approach to API operations, and how they communicate with their community--it won't be a complete solution for this type of exploitation.</p>
<p>Many more waves of startups will come in the future, beginning with lots of passion and excitement, opening up APIs and encouraging developers to build, build, build! The momentum will build, traction will occur, and investment will come. Soon, the startup leaders will not need the API community. They have seen the traction they desired, acquisitions was made, and any blame can be transferred to acquiring organizations, and VCS who are very skilled at shielding themselves from any liability. Maximum value was achieved with the help of the community, it was properly extracted, with the lionshare of value going to acquirers and startup founders, and the majority of the risk left with the developer community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it gets harder nd harder for some of us to showcase new companies with the same passion and trust that they'll do right. There will always be future waves of new startup worshipers, and <a href="http://blog.venmo.com/venmo-api-hackathon">developers to show up at hackathons</a>, building prototypes, engineering applications, and businesses on top of available APIs. New waves of startup founders will be ignorant of what possible future lies ahead, with the other more senior players caring less about the impact this behavior has on the overall health of the API ecosystem--this is how business is conducted, fuck APIs.</p>
<p>In the end it just sucks. APIs when done right, can make a significant impact, and there are ways to invest in, and reward the best developers in an API ecosystem. However APIs can just as easily be used for exploitation, building sharecropping communities, where developers come and work for free, and building value on top of APIs. API consumers are just looking for a stable vendor to deliver the resources they need, and many API startups promise the moon and stars to keep them believing in them. Many even believe what they say, and are willing to do whatever it takes to win in the startup game--at any cost.</p>
<p>While I feel pretty confident that I can tell when an API platform is going to go away because some of the usual signals, like blog, Twitter, and Github go silent. There is one set of signals I think can help us start identifying the bad actors earlier on. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/13/my-tooling-and-api-for-gathering-and-organizing-the-details-of-the-plans-and-pricing-for-apis/">I've been working on a machine readable approach to map out the pricing, rate limits, tiers, and plans for many API platforms</a>, I'm simply calling <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/13/my-tooling-and-api-for-gathering-and-organizing-the-details-of-the-plans-and-pricing-for-apis/">API plans</a>. There are key data signals available in a platforms communication strategy, but I think there are also many telltale signs available in their monetization and business strategies, that we aren't seeing.</p>
<p>In one conversation I had today, I jokingly said I should just email API providers regularly, asking them if they were planning on screwing over their developers anytime soon. While I was joking, I may actually start emailing some providers as part of the rating system I'm ever-evolving. I doubt anyone will ever answer truthfully, but maybe their response time to my question can be used a signal, and if nothing else it just sends a regular reminder to API providers to not fuck over their developers, and give as much lead time as possible before they decide to go away.</p>
<p>I understand that Venmo is keeping the service up for their existing developers (please don't tell me this), and changed their tune about it only being about new developers, but my point is more about communication and the sharing of the road map, holding API providers to a higher bar, and in this situation Venmo, and Paypal should have been a little more transparent in this process, and shared their plans more publicly.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-discovery.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As part of a renewed focus on the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-discovery.png">API discovery definition format APIs.json</a>, I wanted to revisit the propsed machine readable API discovery specification, and see what is going on. First, what is APIs.json? It is a machine readable JSON specification, that anyone can use to define their API operations. APIs.json does not describe your APIs like <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a> and <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> do, it describes your surrounding API operations, with entries that can reference your Open API Spec, API Blueprint, or any other format that you desire.</p>
<p><strong>APIs.json Is An Index For API Operations</strong><br />APIs.json provides a machine readable approach that API providers can put work in describing their API operations, similar to how web site providers describe their websites using <a href="https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/">sitemap.xml</a>. Here are the APIs, who are describing their APIs using APIs.json:</p>

<p><strong>APIs.json Indexes Can Be Created By 3rd Parties</strong><br />One important thing to add, is that these APIs.json files can also be crafted, and published by external parties. An example of this is with the Trade.gov APIs. <a href="http://developer.trade.gov.apievangelist.com/apis.json">I originally created that APIs.json file</a>, and coordinated with them to eventually it get published under their own domain, making it an authoritative APIs.json file. Many APIs.json files will be born outside of the API operations they describe, something you can see in my API stack project:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">The API Stack</a> - Provides almost 1000 APIs.json files, that describe the API operations of many leading public API platforms. There is also around 300 OpenAPI specifications, for some of the platforms described</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>APIs.json Can Be Used To Describe API Collections</strong><br />Beyond describing a single API, within a single domain, APIs.json can also be used to describe entire collections of APIs, providing a machine readable way to organize, and share valuable collections of API resources. Here are a few examples of projects that are producing APIs.json driven collections.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/apis.json">Defining APIs that you depend on for organizational operation.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/apis.json">Defining a specific category of API operations, using the format.</a></li>
<li>SMS - <a href="http://sms.stack.network/">http://sms.stack.network/</a></li>
<li>MMS - <a href="http://mms.stack.network/">http://mms.stack.network/</a></li>
<li>Email - <a href="http://email.stack.network/">http://email.stack.network/</a></li>
<li>News - <a href="http://news.stack.network/">http://news.stack.network/</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>APIs.json Can Be Used To Describe Collections of Collections</strong><br />Then taking things up another rung up the chain, APIs.json can also provide a collection of collections, something I do with my own APIs. Each Github organization on my network has a master APIs.json, providing include links to all other APIs.json within the organization. In this scenario I have over 30 other APIs.json indexed, which can all operate independently of each other, but can also be considered a collection of API collections.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/apis.json">Master</a> - A master collection of API collections I maintain as part of the API Evangelist network operations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The First Open Source Tooling For APIs.json</strong><br />Up until now, this post is all about APIs.json, where in reality the format is useless without their being any tooling built on top of the specification, bringing value to the table. This is why the 3Scale team got to work building an open source APIs.json driven search engine:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a> as an open source tool dedicated to APIs.json</li>
<li><a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a> as a public API search engine, with APIs.json as index.</li>
<li><a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;private API search engine, with APIs.json as index.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>APIs.json Driving Other Open Tooling</strong><br />APIs.io is just the beginning. It won't be enough to convince all API providers that they should be producing APIs.json index of their site operations, just for the API discovery boost. We are going to need APIs.json driven tooling that will service every other stop along the life cycle, including:</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>APIs.json Integrated Into Existing Platforms</strong><br />What areas would you like to see served? Personally, I would like to have the ability to load / unload my APIs.json collections into any service that I use. Allowing me to organize my internal, public, and 3rd party APIs I depend within any platform out there that is servicing the API space. Here are a handful of those types of integrations that are already happening:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://warewolf.io/ESB-blog/swagger-apisjson-support/">WarewolfESB</a> </strong>- ESB integration and API discovery.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://swagger.io/integrating-with-the-swaggerhub-api/">SwaggerHub</a> </strong>- Public and private API hub discovery.</li>
<li><strong>API Management</strong> - In Progress w/ <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>...</li>
<li><strong>API Monitoring</strong> - In Progress with <a href="http://apiscience.com">API Science</a>...</li>
<li><strong>API Change Log </strong>-&nbsp;&nbsp;In Progress with <a href="http://apichangelog.com">API ChangeLog</a>...</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://smartbear.com/plugins/apis-io-import-export/">SmartBear</a> -</strong> API discovery for monitoring, testing, virtualization, and security.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist</a></strong> - API analyst operations.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.kinlane.com/">Kin Lane</a> </strong>- API factory operations (not organic)</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://adopta.agency">Adopta.Agency</a></strong> - Government open data publishing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>APIs.json Linking To The Human Aspects Of API Operations</strong><br />APIs.json is just the scaffolding to hang links to essential aspects of your operations, it doesn't care what you link to. You can start by referencing essential links for your API operations like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Signup</strong> - How to signup for a service.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong> - Where to get support.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Service </strong>- Where are the terms of service.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong> - Where to find the pricing for a service.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>APIs.json Linking to Machine Readable Aspects of API Operations</strong><br />These do not have to be machine readable links, they can reference important things the humans will need first. However, ultimately the goal is to make as much of the APIs.json index as machine readable as possible, using a variety of existing API definition formats, available for a variety of purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenApI Spec</a>, for API description.</li>
<li><a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, for API description.</li>
<li><a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Common</a>, for API licensing.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections">Postman</a>, for run-time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Defining New, Machine Readable Property Elements For APIs.json</strong><br />While the APIs.json spec will evolve, something I talk about below, its real strength lies in its ability to incentivize the development of entirely new, machine readable API definitions, bringing even more value to the API discovery process. Here are a few of the additional specs being crafted independent of, but inspired by APIs.json:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/13/my-tooling-and-api-for-gathering-and-organizing-the-details-of-the-plans-and-pricing-for-apis/">API Plans</a>, for pricing, plans &amp; rate limits.</li>
<li>API Monitoring, for monitoring &amp; testing.</li>
<li>API Changelog, for operational monitoring.</li>
<li>API SDK, for SDK reference.</li>
<li>API Conversations - for the stream around API operations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Roadmap for Version 0.16 of APIs.json</strong><br />That is the 100K view of what is APIs.json now, and the short term plan for the future. Most of the change within the universe APIs.json is mapping will occur add the individual API, and within the machine readable specs that describe them like OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, and Postman. Secondarily, there will be additional, machine readable, API types being defined and added into the spec.</p>
<p>Even with this reality, we do have a handful of changes planned for the 0.16 version of APIs.json:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>commons</strong> - Establish a top level collection of common property elements that apply to ALL APIs being referenced in an APIs.json</li>
<li><strong>country</strong> - Adding a top level country reference using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes">ISO 3166</a>.</li>
<li>New Proper Elements - Suggesting a handful of new property elements to reference common API operation building blocks      
<ul>
<li>Registration</li>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>Github</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I doubt we will see many new additions like commons and country. In the future most of the structural changes to APis.json will be derived from first class property elements (ie. adding documentation or Github), making this the proving ground for defining what are truly the most important aspects of API operations, and what should be machine readable vs human readable.</p>
<p><strong>The Hard Work That Lies Ahead for APIs.json</strong><br />That concludes defining what is APIs.json, and what is next for APIs.json. Now we really have to get to work, doing the heavy lifting around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting more API providers to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">describe their API operations </span>using APIs.json, and publish in the root of the domain for their API ecosystem.</li>
<li>Encourage more API evangelists, brokers &amp; analysts using to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">describe their collections</span>, using APIs.json, building more meaningful indexes and directories of high value APIs.</li>
<li>Encourage platforms to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">build APIs.json into their operations</span>, as a storage and organization schema, but also as import / export format.</li>
<li>Incentivize the development of more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">meaningful tooling that employs APIs.json</span>, and uses it to better serve the API life cycle.</li>
<li>Continue to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">add new API property elements</span>, making sure as many of them as possible evolve to be machine readable, as well as first class citizens in the APIs.json specification.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can stay involved with what we are up to via <a href="http://apisjson.org/">the APIs.json website</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/apis-json/api-json">the APIs.json Github repository</a>. You can also stay in tune with what is going on with <a href="http://apis.io/">APis.io via the website</a>, and its Github repository. If you are doing something with APIs.json, ranging from using it as an index for your API operations, to platform integrations, please let me know. Also, if you envision some interesting tooling you'd like to see happen, <a href="https://github.com/apis-json/api-json/issues/new">make sure and submit a Github issue letting us know</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we still have huge amounts of work to do, when it comes to delivering meaningful API discovery solutions that the industry can put to work, I am pretty stoked with what we have managed to do over the last two years of work on the APIs.json specification, and supporting tooling--momentum that I feel picking up in 2016.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/clinical-trials-gov.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In the last six months I was fortunate enough to be able to push forward one of my side projects, with the help of a <a href="http://knightfoundation.org/grants/201551217/">prototype grant from the Knight Foundation</a>. The mission of the project, is to help move forward existing open federal government data projects, by adopting them, and helping clean up the data, publish simple APIs, generate more meta data, while also telling stories around the project. Something <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/01/18/adopt-a-federal-government-dataset/">I originally called&nbsp;Federal Agency Dataset Adoption</a>, but then shortened to simply <a href="http://adopta.agency">Adopta.Agency</a>.</p>
<p>When I was doing my final presentation in Pittsburgh last month, for the Knight Foundation, someone from the University of Miami was present, and when they got home, contacted me about helping move forward the <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">database available at ClinicalTrials.gov</a>. I do not know much about the data present in the collection, but immediately recognized it as a viable Adopta.Agency project.</p>
<p>To summarize their request, it went something like this :-)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I am working on a project that uses data from https://clinicaltrials.gov/ . Their API is crap to say the least. I was wondering if you could help me out. Is there a tool I could use to get better access to the data? If we download the entire thing is an 850MB zipped file in XML. I only need a fraction of the trials in the db. I guess I am looking for advice on how to proceed.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I get questions like this a lot, something that contributed to me pushing forward my <a href="http://adopta.agency">Adopta.Agency</a> work. The Knight Foundation prototype grant was just that, the prototype funding, something I intend to keep pushing forward, targeting new data sets, and looking for more open data activists to assist in doing the heavy lifting. The ClinicalTrials.gov database seemed like an excellent candidate because it is a high value data sets, and is something that is pretty poorly presented <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/resources/download">via the download and API (?) page available at&nbsp;ClinicalTrials.gov</a>.</p>

<p>Enough talk. I got to work downloading the ClinicalTrials.gov data file, and kicking off a new Adopta.Agency project. Here is what I've accomplished so far:</p>

</ul>
<p>I now have 40+ separate clinical trials data files, available as JSON or CSV, and a complete API that allows for reading and writing, plus a communication and issue management system that will help me engage with others around the project. This entire process is Github driven, with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a> as its machine readable core, which indexes everything that is going on--as it happens.</p>
<p>I think that the ClinicalTrials.gov project represents the Adopta.Agency mission well. There is a wealth of amazing open data sets available on the government perimeter. Much of it isn't well defined, lacking necessary descriptions, tagging, and other meta to make it discoverable, let alone using machine readable, open data formats like APIs.json, OpenAPI Spec, and JSON Schema. I do not blame the folks in government, I understand that they are working with limited resources, and something awareness of modern open data and API approaches. This is why they need our help!</p>
<p>If you'd like to get involved with <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/clinical-trials">the clinical trials open data and API project, head over the project site</a>, and drop me a line using <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/clinical-trials/issues">the project's Github Issue management</a>. I am not sure what is next. I will be looking for feedback from the folks who tuned me into the data set, as well as from my own network--then I can spend some more time on the road map, and see what we can make happen.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Feb 2016</span>
        <p>I had the pleasure of hanging out with Wade Foster (<a href="https://twitter.com/wadefoster">@wadefoster</a>), co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> (<span>How do you pronounce Zapier? It rhymes with happier :-</span>) recently. As I travel less, I'm looking at doing more of these Google Hangouts, to fill my need for hanging out with super smart people, doing really cool things with APIs.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of what Wade, and the Zapier team are up to. His perspective on helping us define "the process", is extremely empowering for EVERYONE and ANYONE, especially non-developers.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/czgRiLT2Y_s" width="560" height="315" align="middle"></iframe></p>
</div>
<p>What Zapier enables, is very much aligned with how I would like the API economy end up operating. Where system to system, website, mobile, and device based API integration is important, but platform interoperability for the masses I feel is much more critical. Zapier is how the average person will take control over their digital self, and move the growing amount of data and content we are generating, across across the growing number of service we depend on daily.</p>
<p>Thanks to Wade, and the <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> team for hanging out with the API Evangelist, and doing such important, and cool work with APIs.</p>

At the same time I'm thinking about how APIs are being used to inject valuable data, content, and other valuable API driven resources to the stream of existing applications we use every day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of this thinking is derived from my bot research, where they impersonate Twitter users, or respond to specific key words, phrases, or keyboard shortcuts in Slack. Some of this thinking comes from learning more about the ability to inject "code steps" into multi-step workflows with Zapier. Then as I continue doing my curation of news I read about Uber allowing developers to create <a href="https://developer.uber.com/docs/tutorial-trip-experiences">trip experiences</a>, opening up another window for potential API driven injection into the Uber "experience".&nbsp;</p>
<p>It got me thinking, where else is this happening? I would say <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview">Twitter Cards</a> is a form of this, but is an example that is more media focused, rather than bots (although it could be bot driven behavior). Then I started looking across the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">50 areas of the API life cycle I'm monitoring</a>, and <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">voice</a> stood out, as another area of potential overlap. Amazon is allowing developers to inject API driven content, data, and other resources into the conversational stream occurring Alexa users. I don't see this being much different that bots injecting responses into the messaging stream of Slack and Twitter users.</p>
<p>I'm just getting going with these thoughts. Something I'm thinking <a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com">containers</a>, and serverless approaches to API deployment are going to impact this line of thought as well. I'm considering pulling together a research project around this overlap, something I will call API injection. Essentially, how are people injecting API driven data, content, and other resources, into the streams of other applications, using APIs. I could see a whole new breed of API provider emerge, just to satisfy the appetite of bots, and other API injection tooling, in engaging with users via the streams they are already existing daily, whether messaging, voice, or any other online experience.</p>
<p>I do not think this is limited to consumer level injections. I could see the B2B approaches to API injection, opening up some pretty interesting <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a> opportunities. Hock'n your bot warez within other people's business streams. ;-) We'll see where this line of thought goes...regardless it is fun to think about.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-transparency.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I talk about companies using APIs to be more transparent, one of the immediate comments I receive from folks is that "not everyone can be public by default". I agree with this situation, but I always counter with an introduction to the concept that transparency can be applied in strictly internal or partner situations as well--public is not the only type of transparency out there.</p>
<p>I am a big proponent of the public version of API driven transparency, but I also feel it can be applied within the firewall, as well as on the open web. Simple developer portals, with a quality selection of valuable APIs, up to date interactive documentation, and other resources, available at a known, yet secured location, can go a long way to stimulate integration--both human (team) and system. Self-service access to API design, definitions, deployment, management, testing, and other life cycle strategies, as well as the API resources can go a long way to establish a rich environment for collaboration, reuse, and consistency in API strategy across an organization.</p>
<p>The benefits of internal and partner layers approaches to transparency, as well as public transparency helps break down silos. Think about the separations between some of the other groups in your organization, and possibly with your leadership up the ladder. Would it help if the road map for your team was out in the open for anyone within your company to follow? Would conversations around outages and system stability be more productive if they included a wider group--maybe preventing some of the micro aggression that occur behind closed doors?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many, many ways API can bring transparency to your organization, way before you ever consider doing it publicly. When I say API, this starts with the technical endpoints, but a modern API conversation ALWAYS involves documentation, code, communications, and feedback loops. The Amazon Web Services family of APIs isn't just purely about the compute and storage endpoints. It is also about the self-service documentation, videos, tutorials, case studies, the 24/7 community forums, and paid tiers of premium support, that makes it all go round.</p>
<p>How could API driven transparency break down the silos in your organization, and help things operate a little more efficiently?</p>

<p>I have been working for a month or so on what some of the common tasks that developer advocates and evangelists would like to see occur around their API operations. These are small little tasks that evangelists should be doing themselves, but if they can encourage their own API community, or the wider developer and tech community to help out, they might achieve a greater reach.</p>
<p>Getting your community to help out with tasks on your platform is nothing new. This is a core premise of modern web API operations, something that can work well in some ecosystems, but has historically been abused by other ecosystems. Some API providers enjoy vibrant communities where developers are more than happy to step up and build things for free, generate a buzz, and show up to events. The reality for most is that it can be very hard to stimulate developers to help in any way, and resort to the exploration of other ways they can stimulate this activity.</p>
<p>As I was exploring these concepts with fellow evangelist, soliciting ideas for what some of the common tasks evangelist might need, someone brought up how sleezy this sounds. Are you going to give away swag, gift cards, or money for these tasks? Are you going to do it for points? I agree, on the surface, when you describe it like that, it does sound cheezy, if not sleezy. Then I got thinking about the micro transactions and tasks people ask of me on a regular basis--things like:</p>

<p>These are some of the common requests I get. Sometimes the requests are paid, sometimes they are not. There is not clear line to follow for any of this.

I do write white papers for money sometimes, but I would never tweet or upvote something for money. I would prioritize consideration for an upvote or retweet, when someone is a paid partner--I tweet things for my paid partners all the time, but not if it isn't relevant.</p>
<p>I am just trying to explore where exactly this line is for one of my API research areas--<a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com">evangelism</a>. Like I do in all of my other areas. I am working &nbsp;with <a href="http://apis.how/hzp7kypxdw">my partner Cloud Elements</a> to explore these concepts, so in a sense I am getting paid for this work, although indirectly. That is not my goal though, I want to help define a simple list of micro transactions that could occur within API ecosystems, and across the web, that benefit both API provider and consumer--equally. I think it can be done ethically, and transparently, and avoid the cheezy and sleezy, however I think many will win in these areas as well.</p>
<p>In the end, I think it is about making the tasks meaningful, and be as transparent about what is going on. I don't see any problem giving developers in your ecosystem gift cards, API credits, or other form of incentive, if they are willing and not being exploited. I know I would do more work for some of the API providers I use, if I got free API credits! (wink wink) I will keep exploring these micro API evangelism activities, and how to do them right. If there are tasks you think should be on the list, or have opinions on where you think the ethical line is, and have examples you'd like to share--feel free to ping me!</p>

<p>I was going through the <a href="https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/index.html">SendGrid API</a> and profiling <a href="https://sendgrid.com/pricing">their available plans and pricing,</a> using my new <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/13/my-tooling-and-api-for-gathering-and-organizing-the-details-of-the-plans-and-pricing-for-apis/">API plan tracking format</a>, and I just have to stop and say--I wish everyone would present their pricing pages as simply as SendGrid does. I cannot speak to whether their pricing is good, fair, or otherwise, but the layout, and the way they explain it, is very simple straightforward and easy to make sense of.</p>
<p>In addition to having the pricing for their email API broke down into six coherent plan tiers, they also have a compare plan details table which shows all six plans, side by side, with each core feature, and other elements of API access available to browse. As an API analyst, it make the data entry for my API tracking much easier, but as an API consumer it make it much easier for me to budget for the API driven resources I will need as part of my API operations.</p>

<p>The state of your pricing page tells a lot about how baked your overall API strategy. I will be the first to admit <a href="http://developer.kinlane.com/pricing/">my own API plans and pricing</a> are half-baked at best. I'm still trying to figure out what I want to be, the value of my resources, and what the market will bear--my pricing page reflects and amplifies this dilemma. This is something I am determined to get into order, as I continue to push forward my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com">API plan research</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://api-docs.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-docs-io-screenshot.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I like my API service providers like I like my APIs, doing one thing and doing it well. Sure services can work together (using APIs), and companies can launch multiple services, but I prefer selecting the services that I use as part of my API operations, as small, modular pieces of API infrastructure. In my opinion, API service providers are just another class of API provider, they just happen to be selling services to businesses that are operating APIs.</p>
<p>You can see this in action <a href="http://api-docs.io/">with API Docs</a>, part of <a href="http://stoplight.io/">the StopLight.io platform</a>. API Docs does one thing well--API documentation! Although for me, it touches on two important areas of the API lifecycle, both <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com">documentation</a> and <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">definitions</a>, but also illustrates the maturation of these stops along the API life cycle, since Tony first launched Swagger UI. The StopLight team is taking API definitions to the next level, but they are also helping us better deliver the documentation portion of our API life cycle(s)--all driven by API definitions. (meta)</p>
<p>If you are looking for another example of this in action, take a look at <a href="https://apitransformer.com/">API transformer</a>, from the <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC team</a>. APIMATIC alone fits my definition of a modular API service provider, doing SDKs, and doing the well, but then you factor in their API translation tooling. #winning Again, APIMATIC is focusing on modular services, that are API definition driven--very similar to what StopLight is up to with their strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016 you will hear me hammer on three key concepts when it comes to delivering services in the API space, and selling to indivivdual API providers. 1) do one thing and do it well, 2) speak in API definition formats, and 3) do it with APIs!! It isn't rocket surgery that API service providers should be practicng what they preach, but in 2016 I am finding that these three characteristics are proving to be a reliable way for me to differentiate the API service providers who will be here for the long haul, and those that won't.</p>

<p><a href="http://stoplight.io/">Stoplight.io is a very cool new API modeling and proxy tool</a>. I just wrote <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/16/automagically-defining-your-api-infrastructure-as-you-work-using-stoplightio/">a post about the overall features of the platform</a>, but I wanted to zoom in on a specific benefit that Stoplight.io brings to the table--the auto generation of OpenAPI Specs, for the mobile apps you depend on, as you use them. To understand the process in detail, I recommend watching the h<a href="http://peach.api-docs.io/1.0/welcome">ow was this created video on the Peach API documentation generated by Stoplight.io</a>.</p>
<p>When you download the Stoplight API designer for Mac (available on the account dashboard), you get the Prism API Proxy, which allows you to easily route all the traffic from your Macbook, as well as iPhone and IPad, through the platform. Once you create a new API, add the base URL for the API you are profiling, StoplLight does the rest, automatically generating an OpenAPI Spec, and attractive API documentation in the application, in real time as you watch--it is pretty cool to watch once you have turned on.</p>
<p>Why do I want to do this? Well first of all, I am someone who has spent five years traveling around the world wearing the same t-shirt evangelizing APIs to everyone who will listen--obviously I have a number of problems. Beyond that, I'm fascinated by the API design practices of the leading "dark APIs" I use everyday, but rather than doing so via a public API program, it is via a mobile device. I'm fascinated by this layer of the API sector, one that is fueling all of the API growth we are seeing, but getting a much smaller portion of the conversation that is dominated by leading public APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help me learn about what is possible with StopLight, I profiled the APIs that <a href="http://linkedin.api-docs.io/v1.0/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="http://instagram.api-docs.io/1.0/search">Instagram</a> mobile applications used. It took me about 15 minutes to go through each application, and hit publish on the documentation you see published to <a href="http://api-docs.io/">API Docs</a>. I feel that there are many lessons to be extracted by the API designs behind these leading applications, and continue providing lessons when you compare these API design strategies with the public API design strategies for the same companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure where all of this will lead. I know that profiling the APIs behind mobile applications is something many feel we shouldn't be doing, something I will write about separately, but I can't help but feel the opposite. In my opinion you should be proud of any APIs you make publicly available to drive any web, mobile, or device applications, and we should be having serious conversations around security, privacy, monetization, and other critical things that are increasingly happening in this shadowy layer of our digital lives.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-shadow-gear.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>After I've talked about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/05/automated-mapping-of-the-api-universe-with-charles-proxy-dropbox-openapi-spec-and-some-custom-apis/">my mapping of the public, and mobile APIs</a> with various folks over the last couple of months, I can usually put folks into one of three camps 1) they do not understand what the hell I am talking about and could care less, wishing the geek dude would shut up 2) thinks its a really interesting idea and worth exploring and discussing, or 3) they express concern, and liken it to scraping, and even hacking. I can understand folks not caring because they don't grasp it technically, but I do not fully yet grasp why people express concern, and think its wrong that I am mapping out, and wanting to discuss this layer of our digital world(s).</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/16/generating-openapi-specs-for-the-mobile-apps-you-depend-on-just-by-using-them/">As I was working with the new features in Stoplight.io last night</a>, profiling some of the applications on my mobile phone's desktop, I spent some more time thinking about this topic. I find it fascinating that companies do not consider the APIs they use to drive mobile applications as public infrastructure, when I can sit in my living room, and engage with them over the public Internet. i find it even more fascinating that some folks consider what I do as contributing to securing problems, when I map these APIs out, share and discuss them on the open Internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not intercepting anyone's traffic, or hacking anyone's systems. I am simply using a publicly available mobile application I found in the app store, and I am interested in understanding how leading companies are designing their APIs. Next I'm interested in discussing how these APIs compare with the same companies public API infrastructure, or possibly why a company does not have a publicly available API program. After that, I am also looking for a better understanding around which of my life bits (and others) are being transported as part of my daily mobile app usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've heard many arguments on why this public infrastructure definition should remain private, like the data that is being transported over it. Ranging from security concerns, all the way to that users should just be thankful the service is available, and its the companies right to do what they think is right, and its the users right to not use the service--markets and all that stuff. While I think this may apply in some situations, there are many scenarios where users are uninformed, being straight up lied to, or do not have the agency to make a decision to leave a platform, or application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My focus in this discussion centers around consumer facing mobile, and device based apps. I'm not talking about business to business integrations, government services, and other digital infrastructure, I'm talking about the ubiquitous mobile apps that the average smart phone user is being pushed. This is the layer of the digital economy that is being built on the exhaust of the average mobile and Internet consumer. This is one reason why many folks do not want to disclose and discuss this shadowy layer of the application, IoT, and ultimately API economy--they hope they will get their piece of the action some day, and do not want to rub the money people wrong by rocking the boat.</p>
<p>While I think money motivates a lot of the thinking that occurs, but I can't help but feel that a narrow focus is also a part of it. In the mad rush to be the next big thing, a lot of things get kicked to the side. Things like security and privacy get overlooked, or compromised, and a security through obscurity strategy is installed by default, which works just fine until...well it doesn't. If the bad guys want to know your infrastructure, all they have to do is turn on Charles Proxy like I did, and route your computer, mobile and tablet devices through it. Hiding the blueprint for your APIs, that you are using over the open Internet, and being afraid to discuss them publicly is not good business, and doesn't address the security and privacy concerns everybody who operates on the open Internet will face at some point in the future.</p>
<p>I feel like having people in my world express concern to me about using Charles Proxy to map this world of APIs demonstrates there is an imbalance in the game. Wile I am looking to discuss the business thats going on in this layer, my priority is security and privacy around this very public infrastructure. I get that many of you have concerns about giving away your "not so" secret sauce, or that disclosing what goes on in this layer will hurt your bottom line, I'm thinking that discussing security and privacy should be prioritized, and not discussing them will eventually hurt your bottom line worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll end my rant there. I'm interested in gathering more of these concerns, as I continue to map out this layer of our digital world. Like the rest of my API research, I'm finding that I'm learning a lot about the API design strategy of leading mobile application providers, and better understanding of how APIs are fueling the mobile economy, which is something I am also looking to extend to the emerging device economy.</p>

<p>I stayed up way too late playing with some of the new features in <a href="http://stoplight.io/">Stoplight.io</a>. If you aren't familiar with what the Stoplight team has been cooking up--they have been hard at work crafting a pretty slick set of API modeling tools. I feel the platform provides me with a new way to look at the API life cycle--a perspective that spans multiple dimensions, including <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com">definition</a>, <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">virtualization</a>, <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com">documentation</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">testing</a>, <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">discovery</a>, orchestration, and <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">client</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stoplight.io gives me a pretty powerful platform for managing, interfacing, sharing, collaborating, publishing, understanding, and evolving my API designs and definitions. You can begin modeling your APIs by importing an existing OpenAPI Spec, RAML, or Postman collection, or get to work modeling a new or existing API via the Stoplight client interface, which is just one tool in the Stoplight modeling toolbox. Additionally, I am able to create separate work spaces and import the OpenAPI Spec <a href="http://developer.kinlane.com/">for all my own APIs</a>, as well as the&nbsp;<a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">APIs that I depend on in the API space</a>&nbsp;&lt; this organization is very important to me.</p>
<p>Stoplight.io provides me with a new way to approach the organization of my API design and definitions, but the biggest impact for me, is when it comes to modeling the existing APIs out there. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/05/automated-mapping-of-the-api-universe-with-charles-proxy-dropbox-openapi-spec-and-some-custom-apis/">I've been working on automating the generation of OpenAPI Spec definitons of the APIs I use, as I use them</a>--something that is two separate tasks at the moment. Stoplight.io does this, but does it waaaay better than what I have been doing, quietly crafting the OpenAPI Spec for any API I am using, in the background when you have Stoplight API discovery mode turned on, and the Prism API Proxy on.</p>
<p>I am enjoying the view of the API space that Stoplight.io is giving me. I got completely lost last night improving on my API designs, profiling other APIs in the space that were already in my work queue, and mapping out the dark APIs behind the mobile apps that I depend on (something I will write about separately). I am curious to see what API designers, and architects do with StopLight--I feel like it has the potential to shift the landscape pretty significantly, something I haven't seen any API service provider do in a while.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-definitions.png" alt="" width="25%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have had multiple conversations with folks in the space who are building services and tooling for the API sector lately, where I was asked whether or not they should only be using existing API definition formats, or create their own API definition format that better represents what they are delivering. The reasoning is usually that they feel their own format would offer a more comprehensive approach than any single, existing API definition could--yet they fully understand the potential for adoption when they use existing formats like <a href="http://apis.how/xmynjnqxwr">OpenAPI Spec</a> and <a href="http://apis.how/2zarzoqrhc">API Blueprint</a>.</p>
<p>My answer to them, is you deliver d) All The Above. I fully get that you will have your own unique view of the API space, and of what your tools and services will deliver, so you should be defining your own schema, but that you also can't ignore what is happening with OpenAPI Spec annd API Blueprint either. There is a groundswell of services, tooling, and savvy API architects and developers using these existing API definition formats, and you do not want to be an island in this very connected sea.</p>
<p>Some examples of this already in motion can be found with <a href="http://apis.how/kjtj5bbuxu">APIMATIC</a> and <a href="http://apis.how/v741olinqd">Runscope</a>. Both of these providers fluently speak multiple existing <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/organizations/">API definition formats</a>, but they also have their own, custom format for describing what their service(s) brings to the table. I'd say the one difference is that Runscope is more focused on their own format, emphasizing the import / export in the Runscope version, while APIMATIC is holding their version behind the scenes and emphasizing the use the existing API definition format of their own.</p>
<p>I think it is important that service providers flex both their own spec, as well as supporting existing formats like these providers do, even if it is just by using <a href="http://apis.how/okfoexmpcm">the API Transformer service</a>. However, there is also an opportunity at the intersection of these two worlds with the x- extension for OpenAPI Spec. I honestly am unsure if API Blueprint has similar features, but will find out shortly. This is where I see API service providers merging their own custom schema, with the existing OpenAPI Spec. You can do the same within the <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API dsicovery format APIs.json</a>, when it comes to defining your API indexes and collections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I talk OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, and APIs.json with more providers, I am finding that the majority of them are understanding the importance of supporting the leading formats, but also see aspects of the space that don't get covered in these formats, and want to better contribute their own vision of the space. I support both these paths, as long as we do not ever find ourselves cornered in our dogma silos, only believing in a single API definition format, or only supporting our own proprietary format that nobody else speaks. #Balance #Interroperability</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://zapier.com"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/zapier-zaps-orchestration.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a>I'm spending some time going through <a href="https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/reference/">v2 docs for the Zapier API</a>, following the release of <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/workflow-automation/">multi steps work flow</a>s, and code steps for calculating, converting, and manipulating data and content, last week. While IFTTT gets a significant amount of the attention of the API reciprocity platforms I track on, I feel like Zapier is the most successful, and reflects most of what I'd lie to see in an API driven integration, and automation platform--specifically, the fact they have an API.</p>
<p>Along with keeping track of what Zapier is up to, I'm spending more time thinking about the increasing number of <a href="http://bots.apievangelist.com/">API driven bot platforms</a> I'm seeing emerge, and <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com">API enabled voice</a> platforms like <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service">Alexa Voice Service</a>. As I was reading Zapier's platform documentation, I couldn't help but see what I'd consider to be the essential building blocks for any integration, automation, and reciprocity platform emerge:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong> - Providing the mechanisms for the most common approaches to API authentication, including basic auth, digest auth, session based, oAuth.</li>
<li><strong>Triggers</strong> - Provide the framework to use verbs and nouns, with help text, and webhook infrastructure to trigger anything users will desire.</li>
<li><strong>Actions</strong> - Provide the framework to use verbs and nouns, with help text, and webhook infrastructure to accomplish an action users will desire.</li>
<li><strong>Searches</strong> -Allowing for simple questions to be asked, and provide a framework to allow APIs to e employed in answering any question asked.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong> - Putting the automation in API integration, allowing for webhooks that can be triggered, and used as part of actions.</li>
<li><strong>Notification</strong> - Using notifications throughout the process to keep the platform, developers, and end-users informed about anything that is relevant.</li>
<li><strong>Scripting</strong> - Allowing for code integration for calculating, converting, and manipulating data as part of any step of the process.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-step</strong> - Going beyond just just triggers and actions, and allowing for multi-step workflows that put multiple APIs to use.</li>
<li><strong>Activation</strong> - Allowing developers and end-users of the integration, and automation to decide whether the process is invite only, private, or publicly available.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the scripting, multi-step, and activation pieces are pretty localized to Zapier, and other implementing platforms, the authentication, triggers, actions, searches, webhooks, and notifications are something that all API providers should be thinking about, as touch points with their own infrastructure. You should be supporting common approaches to API authentcation, using meaningful verbs and nouns in your API design, and have a robust webhooks workflow available for your platform.</p>
<p>As I do my research, I'm constantly looking for the common building blocks of any single area of my research--in this case API reciprocity. I'm adding these to the common building blocks in this research, but as you can see the webhooks portion also overlaps with my webhooks research. In addition to this overlap I am also looking for how these building blocks also overlap other existing research areas like bots, and real time, then even as part of some new areas I'm considering adding, like around serverless technology.</p>
<p>I am intrigued by these interesting overlaps in my core research right now, between reciprocity, bots, real time, voice, webhooks, and virtualizations. I'm also very interested in understanding more around how these areas are being applied in some of the areas I am research as part of my API stack work in messaging, social, and other sectors where APIs are making an impact.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-robot-voice.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I just finished looking through the documentation for the <a href="https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/">Zapier API</a>, and for the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service">Alex Voice Service</a>, trying to understand the approach these platforms are taking to incorporate API driven resources into their services. How do you translate a single API call into a Zapier trigger or action? How do you build a rich index of resources for Alexa to search via voice commands? Learning how APIs are being consumed, or can be consume, is an infinitely fascinating journey for me, and something I enjoy researching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of my research into reciprocity, bots, and voice enablement via APIs, makes me think more about experience based API design, trumping much of the resource based dogma that has domnated much of the conversation. How will my APIs enable meaningful interoperability via Zapier, voice searches via Alexa, and stimulate interesting bot interactions? I am not just focusing on how my resources are defined, I am now also forced to think about how they will be searched, consumed, and put to use in these new client experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just like mobile significantly shaped how we craft our APis, <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">automation</a>, <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">voice</a>, <a href="http://bots.apievangelist.com/">bots</a>, and increasingly Internet connected devices will continue to define our API strategies. Users, and developers will increasingly small, meaningful resources that they can use to orchestrate their personal and business lives, that will respond to simple voice commands at home, in the car, and via our mobile devices. When we are designing our APIs, are we thinking about these bite-size resources that will be needed in this emerging bot and voice driven evolution in the API space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-start.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I shared a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/18/taking-a-snapshot-of-just-the-essential-api-building-blocks-across-my-research/">list of just the essential building blocks from across only 21 areas of my API areas of the API life cycle</a> with a company I'm helping craft an API strategy for, and I got some very common feedback--all this information is great, but where do I start with my API strategy? This is excellent feedback, as that particular overview is void of any specific 101, or on-boarding elements for each of the areas of the API life cycle that I cover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is on purpose for this particular document, providing me with a generic outline that I can use in many different scenarios, but the feedback rings loud in my ears, and is something I get constantly. I receive a constant barrage of emails, tweets, and voice mails asking me where they should get started with their API strategy, spanning both the provider, and consumer side of the API coin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem for me in all of this is that what "API" means, where someone is at in their journey, and what their overall goals are, can be radically different depending on who you talk to. What API design means to you, may not be what it means to the next. What API deployment might be about gateway solutions in your organizations, for others it means cloud based, or possibly specifically with a <a href="https://restlet.com/">Java API framework like Restlet</a>. My goal in my research is to to map out each area, distill down the common building blocks, then yes, build as many introductions (101), and on-boarding doorways as I can, targeting both API provider and consumers, across a wide variety of business sectors, and the public sphere.</p>
<p>To help illustrate my point, I get regular requests from folks around how do they pull all the data on Twitter via the API, and how do publish a video to all the leading video platforms via APIs. In the same day I will get requests on where do you start in defining a rating system that applies to all APIs, or start with APIs at a large higher educational institution where you have no contacts, with a very hostile IT department. The scope is wide, and varies dramatically, so creating a single document providing everyone with a getting started point is very, very difficult.</p>
<p>With that said, it is what I am working towards. 2015 was very much about mapping the scope of the entire space, and organize into specific areas (right or wrong). 2016 is very much about making sense of those areas, and each stop along the API life cycle, within the areas that I have mapped. I'm working on 101 pages for all 50 of the life cycle areas you find on my home page at the moment. I am already working with my partner 3Scale to take all the common building blocks I have, organize them into different areas, to craft what I'm calling "playbooks" for different verticals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are looking to deploy a content or data API, there will be a playbook. If you are looking to get started with APIs at your existing institution, government, or enterprise organizations, there will be a playbook for you. I plan on taking the overall map of the API life cycle I've drawn, and the common building blocks I've identified within these areas, and begin remixing and publishing them as specific scenarios, providing "playbooks" that hope to be relevant to more specific situations, helping organizations and individuals better understand where they should be starting with their API strategy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/playing-with-a-json-representation-for-the-plans-for-many-of-the-leading-apis/">A couple of weeks ago I started playing with a machine readable way to describe the pricing, and plans available for an API</a>. I spent a couple of days looking through over 50 APIs, and how they handled the pricing, and their API access plans, and gathered the details in a master list, which I am using for my master definition. I picked up this work, and moved it forward over the last two days, further solidifying the schema, as well as launching an API, and set of admin tools for me to use.</p>
<p>While my primary objective is to help me establish a machine readable definition that I can use to describe the plans of the APIs I provide, as well as the ones that I monitor as part of my regular work in the space--I needed an easier way to help me track the details of each API's plan. So I got to work creating an simple, yet robust admin tool that allows me to add one or many plans, for each API that I track on.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-plans-spec-interface-algolia.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>To help me drive this administrative interface I needed an API (of course), that would allow me to add, edit, and delete the details for each plan, using my API plan schema as a guide. I got to work designing, developing, and launched <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/api/">the first beta version of my API plans API</a>, to help me gather, and organize the details for any API I want, whether its mine, or one of the many public APIs I track on.</p>
<p><a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/api/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-plans-ui-interface.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Now that I have an API, and an administrative interface, I'm going to get to work adding the data I gathered from my previous research. I have almost 60 APIs to enter, then I hope to be able to step back, and see the API plan data Ive gathered in a new light. Once I get to this stage, I'm looking to craft a simple embeddable page for viewing an API's plan, and create some visualizations for looking across, and comparing multiple APIs. I'm looking to apply this concept to verticals, like with business data via APIs like Crunchbase, AngelList, OpenCorporates, and others.</p>
<p>While my API plan schema is far from a stable version, it at least provides me with a beginning definition that I can use in my API profiling process. Here is the current version I have for the Algolia API, to demonstrate a little bit of what I am talking about.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/82f55e8c7adccf2157e7.js"></script>
<p>This current version allows me to track the pages, timeframes, metrics, geo, limits, individual resources, extensions, and other elements that go into defining API plans, and then actually organizing them into plans, that pretty closely match to what I'm seeing from API providers. For each plan I define, I can add specific entries, that describe pricing structures, and other hard elements of API pricing, but then I can also track on other elements, giving me a looser way to track on aspects that impact API plans, but may not be pricing related.</p>
<p>I am pretty happy with what I have so far. Something I hope in a couple of years this could be used as a run-time engine for API operations, in a similar way that the OpenAPI Spec, and API Blueprint are being used used today, but rather than describing the technical surface area, this machine readable definition format will describe the business surface area of an API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-differences.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Evaluating exactly what is the "right" API can be very difficult. This is what I do full time, and its hard for me to understand the differences--I cannot image what it is like for people who have real jobs. I've used both the <a href="https://data.crunchbase.com/">Crunchbase API</a>, and the <a href="https://angel.co/api">AngelList API</a> for some time now, to help me better profile the companies that I am paying attention to as part of my research. I use both the website, and API for both of these business data platforms on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/10/crunchbase-raises-2m-series-a2-launches-paid-plans-for-data-access/">As I read about the recent investment in Crunchbase, and their changes in pricing</a>, I'm reminded of my half finished work, incorporating the <a href="https://api.opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates API</a>, and taking another look at all of my business data sources. I won't be able to afford Crunchbase after the changes, which will suck, but honestly I'm not a big fan of their overall operations, and approach, and happy to see the data source leave <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">the stack of APis that I depend on</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This leaves me assessing what is next, as any major API plan changes will do to consumers. In addition to needing the data behind each company I monitor in the API space, I need a public page to reference across my storytelling. It is unfortunate that I've used Crunchbase for this historically. In an effort to keep my readers informed, I've also been supporting the very closed (and increasingly so) platform. When I pick up my business API integration work, I will switch off Crunchbase, keep my AngelList feed, and turn on OpenCorporates, but I will also start using the public OpenCorporates page as the URL reference I use in my storytelling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, it is important to find the resources I need to run my business, but it is also important to support services that have healthy practices. I have an overall objective to have relevant business data on companies I monitor, something Crunchbase and AngelList has provided a portion of. However I am also having to weigh what information OpenCorporates provides me, and where this overlaps with, or is in addition to Crunchbase and AngelList. I will lose some valuable information when I turn off Crunchbase, that I will not be able to replace with OpenCorporates. This is ok. The ethical trade off, between supporting OpenCorporates and Crunchbase is worth it to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://mattermark.com/api/">other sources of information like Mattermark</a>, but similar to the path Crunchbase is on, their services are priced out of range for small, startups like me, who really aren't playing in the VC game. OpenCorporates has a more tiered approach to pricing, making it more accessible to me, allowing me to get access to data, and scale sensibly, as my needs grow. OpenCorporates also also me to add data to their corporate database, which is something I will explore through an API lens in future stories. In this post, I just wanted to explore the obvious and subtle differences between these similar API providers who provide business information.</p>
<p>Each of these providers offer up different data points, coupled with <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">different API plans</a>, as well as <a href="http://licensing.apievangelist.com/">licensing</a> and <a href="http://tos.apievangelist.com">terms of service</a>. Understanding the differences takes some serious evaluation, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">lending weight to the fact that many companies, and application developers will be needing API brokers in the future</a>. Why I choose one provider over another may not be be the same things other companies will be considering, as I have different objectives, but having as many details of these API operations profiled is important, to help other companies go through the same process that I am going through--something I will keep working on as the API Evangelist, through my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack work</a>.</p>

<p>One reason for having a well thought out, comprehensive API strategy, is that you are thinking about all the moving parts, and at ever turn you can weave things together, and potentially amplify the forward motion of your API operations. With every new release you should be considering all other areas of your API strategy, how you can include your API consumers, your partners, and where all of the opportunities lie when it comes to evangelism, and storytelling.</p>
<p>This approach <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/06/an-embeddable-run-in-postman-button-for-your-api/">was present in the latest release from Postman, with the release of their Run in Postman, embeddable button</a>. As part of the release of the new embeddable button for their API client tooling, Postman also made a call for partners. It was a savvy marketing technique to reach out to partners like this, something that will not just generate implementations in the wild, but will also establish new partnerships, strengthen existing ones, while also generating new blog posts, and press releases around API platform operations.</p>
<p>When it comes to the API Evangelist operations, the approach by Postman is gold--when I consider across many areas of my own strategy. Postman is showcased as part of my <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">API client research</a>, their product release exists within my <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com/">embeddable API research</a>, and also lives within my <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/">API evangelism</a> and <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/">API partners research</a>. The moral of this story is Postman thought across their strategy when crafting the release strategy for their new feature, and I also put in similiar thoughts across my own strategy while reading their blog post, giving us both an opportunity for establishing biggest bang possible, around a single API platform release.</p>

<p>I was in Philadelphia last week, hanging out with educational technology practitioners, and at one of the dinners I found myself talking to a young lady who was a digital learning assistant at a university. She spent her days, helping administrators, and faculty, when it came to understanding what digital resources and tooling were available, and assisting them to better understand how they can put them to use in their daily work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This conversation left me thinking about the role I play in the API space. I long ago elevated myself above evangelizing any single APIs, a position I enjoy because of my partners <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Element</a>, <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a>, and <a href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a>. I elevated myself into this role because I saw nobody else doing it across the space, and saw an opportunity to make a wider impact, beyond just peddling a single product or service. My conversation in Philly made me realize how much general API assistant I am in my daily operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The role of an API assistant, helping others understand that APIs exist, and how they can be applied in our everyday personal and business lives is an increasingly critical role in our society. How do you teach people they can pull corporate data from <a href="https://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a>, or Tweets from a specific #hashtag into a Google Spreadsheet? How do you help people understand that APIs make the everyday exhaust from your world <br />organize-able", accessible, and more "orchestrate-able", via APIs--without knowing how to code!</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">I've talked about my work as an API broker, where I help organize coherent stacks of APIs, for potential use in specific business verticals, and web, mobile, or even device based applications</a>. I'm adding API assistance to this spectrum now, because an API broker addresses the professional business side of the API equation, but an API assistance addresses the individual side of the API equation. I hope this schism in my own existence as API evangelist, broker, and assistant, is also addressed at organizations, and independently in the API space, because we are sure going to need more expertise at these levels, if we are going to make all of this work.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Feb 2016</span>

<p>I look at a lot of APIs, and one characteristic I judge them by, is their ability to simply explain what their API does. The most import aspect to any individual or company when doing APIs, is the process can potentially bring you out of your bubble, and make you think a little bit more externally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most common things I see from API providers, is they think it terms of, and present their API in the context of the language they program in. It is a ".NET Web API", or a Python API. When in reality it is a web API, and if it employs enough HTTP, it should be able to be consumed in any language.</p>
<p>Another regular mistake made by API providers, is they describe their API in terms of their own platform, and never actually tell you what it does. Here is an example of this from <a href="https://docs.pushbullet.com/">PushBullet</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Pushbullet's API enables developers to build on the Pushbullet infrastructure. Our goal is to provide a full API that enables anything to tap into the Pushbullet network.</em></p>
<p>While I appreciate the short description of what the API does, I'm left still not knowing what it does. You see, I do not know about Pushbullet like you do, and chances are neither will many of your other potential API consumers. Knowing about your company shouldn't get in the way of me learning about what your API does.</p>
<p>To me, this is classic walled silo-itis, where programmers are operating within their little company or tech silo, and don't look much further. That is ok, this is why we do APis, to help break you free of these cycles.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.algolia.com/pricing"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/algolia-logo.png" alt="" width="25%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am continuing to push forward my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com">API plans research</a>, where I look closely at the common building blocks of the service composition, pricing, and plans available for some of the leading API providers out there. I have no less than ten separate stories derived from <a href="https://www.algolia.com/pricing">Algolia, the search API provider's, pricing page</a>--I will be using Algolia as a reference for how to plan your API, along with elder API pioneers like Amazon, and Twilio, for some time now.</p>
<p>On area of Algolia's approach I think is worth noting, is the enterprise level of their operations. They provide the most detail regarding what you get as part of the enterprise tier, being very public about their operations, in a way you just do not see with many API providers. When it comes down to it, the Algolia enterprise search plans are all about no limitations--I think their description says it well:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Your own dedicated infrastructure. Don't like limits? Meet our dedicated clusters. Optimal for high volumes of data, they scale to thousands of queries per second. Search performance and indexing times have never been so good.</em></p>
<p>The basic building blocks of how Algolia is monetizing their search API, records and operation API calls, melt away at the enterprise level. The lower four plans for Algolia API access meter the number of record, and operation API calls you make, and charge consumers, using four separate pricing levels. If you are an enterprise customer, the need for this metering melts away, eliminating the default limitations applied to lower levels of API consumption.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.algolia.com/pricing"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/enterprise-solutions.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I support more transparency in enterprise API plans, as well as other <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com">partner tiers of access</a>. I do not think Algolia's approach to delivering enterprise services is unique, but their straightforward, simple, and transparent approach to doing it is. In an API driven world, the enterprise levels of access do not always have to be that age old mating dance, that involves smoke and mirrors, and pricing pulled out of a magic hat--it can be just be about reducing the limitations around retail levels of API access, and getting business done.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.getpostman.com/2016/01/28/the-run-in-postman-button-for-improved-documentation/">The popular API client tool Postman just launched an embeddable "run in Postman" button</a>, that you can use to fast track integration with your API(s). Shortly after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/19/button-to-run-this-api-in-the-http-api-client-of-my-choice/">I wrote a post about the importance of API definition driven embeddable tools for API service providers</a>, Postman contacted me and said, "hey! we are already working on that!" ;-)</p>
<p>With the latest update, when you use your Postman Client, you can generate some embeddable JavaScript, which you can then post alongside your API documentation, throughout your developer portal, or possibly anywhere on the open web. Something that could trim minutes, or even hours off the time it takes for new developers to go from discovery to integration.</p>
<p><a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">Embeddable</a> tooling for APIs is nothing new, something we've seen leading providers like Twitter and Facebook employ successfully, but it is something that is fairly new for API service providers. Having a robust embeddable strategy like this one from Postman, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/27/embedding-your-language-sdks-in-your-apiary-documentation-using-apimatic/">last week's example from SDK provider APIMATIC</a>, is something all API service providers should be considering in 2016.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.factual.com/data-docs/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/factual-developers.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the approaches to <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans</a> I was studying recently is from the data provider <a href="http://developer.factual.com">Factual</a>, who provides access to places, products, and other valuable data-sets. I felt Factual had a pretty straightforward approach to the free tier of access for their platform, that was worthy of sharing.</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.factual.com/data-docs/">When you visit the page for the Factual data services</a>, they offer two distinct levels of free access to data resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free (unverified) -</strong>&nbsp;Up to 100 read requests per day. No access to resolve or write APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Free (verified) -</strong>&nbsp;Up to 10,000 requests per day for most tables.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I look at the plans for many APIs, they almost always have free tiers of access, but normally there is just one dimension to it. You get a certain amount of API calls per second, day, or month, for free. What is unique about the approach from Factual is they offer another free level, which gives you more API calls if you verify yourself--this is a pretty interesting approach, that other providers should consider.</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.factual.com/data-docs/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/factual-data-services-overview.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>You want free access, but don't want to verify yourself, and you get 100 red requests per day, but if you go through <a href="http://www.factual.com/keys/verify">the verification process</a>, you get 10,000 requests per day--a pretty significant difference. I am talking with a number of providers lately about how they are tightening up the free tiers of API access, and working to incentivize users to become paying customers, which made me take another look at Factual's approach.</p>
<p>I think free access to APIs is essential to operations, but I think providers need to be more thoughtful about just how much of their resources they give away at this tier. It is OK if you want to get to know your consumers, before you give away too much of the farm. There can be a lot of bad behavior from API consumers at the free tier level, and developer verification is one way you can minimize the impact on your API operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/charles-proxy/reclaim-charles-proxy.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have been working hard for about a year now trying to craft machine readable API definitions for the leading APIs out there. I've <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/21/parsing-charles-proxy-exports-to-generate-swagger-definitions-while-also-linking-them-to-each-path">written before about my use of Charles Proxy to generate OpenAPI Spec files</a>, something I'm evolving over the last couple days, making it more automated, and hopefully making my mapping of the API universe much more efficient.</p>
<p>Hand crafting even the base API definition for any API is time consuming, which is something that swells quickly to being hours when you consider the finish work that required, so I was desperately looking how I could automate this aspect of my operations more. I have two modes when looking at an API, review mode where I'm documenting the API and its surrounding operations, with the second being about actually using the API. While I will still be reviewing APIs, my goal is to immediately begin actually using an API, where I feel most of the value is at, while also kicking off the documentation process in the same motion.</p>
<p><strong>Logging All Of My Traffic Using Charles Proxy On Machine</strong><br />Using <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles Proxy</a>, I route all of my network traffic on my Macbook Pro through a single proxy which I am in control of, allowing me to log every Internet location my computer visits throughout the day. It is something I cannot leave running 100% of the time, as it breaks certificates, sets of security warnings from a number of destinations, but is something I can run about 75% of my world through--establishing a pretty interesting map of the resources I consume, and produce on each day.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/charles-proxy/relciam-charles-proxy-auto-save-settings.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Auto Saving Charles Proxy Session Files Every 30 Minutes</strong><br />While running running Charles Proxy, I have it setup to auto save a session XML every 30 minutes, giving me bite size snapshots of transaction throughout my day. I turn Charles Proxy on or off, depending on what I am doing. I selected to save as a session XML file because after looking at each format, I felt it had the information I needed, while also easily imported into my database back end.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Leverage Dropbox Sync And API To Process Session Files</strong><br />The session XML files generated by Charles Proxy get saved into my local Dropbox folder on my Macbook Pro. Dropbox does the rest, it syncs all of my session XML files to the cloud, securely stored in a single application folder. This allows me to easily generate profiles of websites and APIs, and something that passively occurs in the background while I work on specific research. The only time Dropbox will connect and sync my files, is when I have Charles Proxy off, otherwise it can't establish a secure connection.</p>
<p><strong>Custom API To Process Session Files Available In Dropbox</strong><br />With network traffic logged, and stored in the cloud using Dropbox, I can then access them via the Dropbox API. To handle this work, I setup an API that will check the specified Dropbox app folder, associated with its Dropbox API application access, and import any new files that it finds. Once a file has been processed, I delete it from Dropbox, dumping any personally identifiable information that may have been present--however, I am not doing banking, or other vital things with Charles Proxy on.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/charles-proxy/reclaim-store-charles-proxy-files-in-dropbox.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Custom API To Organize Transactions By Host &amp; Media Type</strong><br />I now have all my logged transactions stored in a database, and I can begin to organize them by host, and media type--something I'm sure I will evolve with time. To facilitate this process I have created a custom API that allows me to see each unique domain or sub-domain that I visit during my logging with Charles Proxy. I am mostly interested in API traffic, so I'm looking for JSON, XML, and other API related media types. I do not process any image, and many other common media types, but do log traffic to HTML sites, routing into a separate bucket which I describe below.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Custom API To Generate OpenAPI Spec For Each Transaction</strong><br />In addition to storing the primary details for each transaction I log, for each transaction with a application/json response, I auto-generate an OpenAPI Spec file, mapping out the surface area of the API endpoint. The goal is to provide a basic, machine readable definition of the transaction, so that I can group by host, and other primary details I'm tracking on. This is the portion of the process that generates the map I need for the API universe.</p>
<p><strong>Custom API To Generate JSON Schema For Each Transaction</strong><br />In addition to generating an OpenAPI Spec for&nbsp;each transaction that I track on with a application/json response, I generate a JSON Schema for the JSON returned. This allows me to map out what data is being returned, without it containing any of the actual data itself. I will do the same for any request body as well, providing a JSON Schema definition for what data is being sent as well as received within any transaction that occurs during my Charles Proxy monitoring.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/charles-proxy/reclaim-charles-proxy-process-files.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Automation Of Process Using The EasyCRON Layer Of Platform</strong><br />I now have four separate APIs that help me automate the logging of my network traffic, storing, processing of all transactions I record, then automatically generate an OpenAPI Spec, and JSON Schema for each API call. This provides me with a more efficient way to kick off the API documentation process, automatically generating machine readable API definitions and data schema, from the exhaust of my daily work, which includes numerous API calls, for a wide variety different reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Helping Me Map Out The World Of Web APIs As The API Evangelist</strong><br />The primary goal of this work is to help me map out the world of APIs, as part of my work as the API Evangelist. Using this process, all I have to do is turn on Charles Proxy, fire up my Postman, visit an API I want to map out, and start using the API. Usually within an hour, I will then have an Open API Spec for each transaction, as well as aggregated by host, along with a supporting JSON Schema for the underlying request or response data model--everything I need to map out more APIs, more efficient scaling what I do.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Helping Me Understand The Media Types In Use Out There Today</strong><br />One thing I noticed right away, was the variety of media types I was coming across. At first I locked things down to application/json, but then I realized I wanted XML, and others. So I reversed my approach and let through all media-types, and started building a blacklist for which ones I did not want to let through. Leaving this part of the process open, and requiring manual evaluation of media types is really pushing forward my awarnesss of alternative media types, and is something that was an unexpected aspect to this owrk.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/charles-proxy/reclaim-process-transactions.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Helping Me Understand The Companies I Use Daily In My Business</strong><br />It is really interesting to see the list of hosts that I have generated as part of this work. Some of these companies I depend on for applications that I depend on like Tweetdeck, Github, and Dropbox, while others are companies I'm looking to learn more about as part of API Evangelist research, and storytelling. I'm guessing this understanding of the companies that I'm using daily in my work will continue to evolve significantly as I continue looking at the world through this lens.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Helping Me Understand The Data I Exchange Daily With Companies</strong><br />The host of each transaction gives me a look at the companies I transact with daily, but the JSON Schema derived from request and responses that are JSON, also giving me an interesting look at the information I'm exchanging in my daily operations, either directly with platforms I depend on, or casually with websites I visit, and the web applications I'm testing out. I have a lot of work ahead of me to actually catalog, organized and derive meaning from the schema I am generating, but at least I have them in buckets for further evaluation in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Routing Websites That I Visit Into A Separate Bucket For Tracking On</strong><br />At first I was going to just ditch all GET requests that returned HTML, but instead I decided to log these transactions, keeping the host, path, and parameters in a separate media type bucket. While I won't be evaluating these domains like I do the APIs that return JSON, XML, etc, I will be keeping an eye on them. I'm feeding these URLs into my core monitoring system, and for some companies I will pull their blog RSS, Twitter handles, and Github accounts, in addition to looking for other artifacts like OpenAPI Specs, API Blueprints, Postman Collections, APIs.json, and other machine readable goodies.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/charles-proxy/reclaim-open-api-spec.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Targeting Of Specific Web, Mobile, Device, And API Driven Platforms</strong><br />Now that I have this new, more automated API mapping system setup, it will encourage me to target specific web mobile, devices, and API platforms. I will be routing my iPhone, and iPad through the proxy, allowing me to map out mobile applications. If I can just get to work using an API in my Postman client, or use the website or mobile app, and auto-generate a map of the APIs in use in OpenAPI Spec, and data models using JSON Schema, you are going to find me mapping a number of new platform targets in 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ok, So What Now? What Am I Going To Do With This Mapping Info Next?</strong><br />You know, I'm not sure what is next. I learned a lot from this 25 hour sprint, to better automate this process. I think I will just sit back and let it run for a week or two, and do what I regularly do. Visit the websites and developer areas of platforms that I'm keeping an eye on. I will keep using APIs to run my own operations, as well as play with as many APIs as I possibly can fit into my days. Periodically I will check it to see how my new API mapping system is working, and see if I can't answer some pressing questions I have:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>How much do I create vs. consume? ie. POST, PUT &amp; PATCH over GET?</li>
<li>How often do I use my own resources vs the API resources of others?</li>
<li>Do I have any plan B or C for all resources I am using?</li>
<li>Do I agree with the terms of service for these platforms I am using?</li>
<li>Do I pay any of the services that are a regular part of my daily operations?</li>
<li>Am I in control of my account and data for these platforms &amp; companies?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/charles-proxy/reclaim-json-schema.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></p>
<p>For the moment, I am just looking at establish a map of the digital surface area I touch on each day, and further scale my ability to map out unknown areas of the API wildnerness. I am curious to see how many OpenAPISpecs and JSON Schemas I can generate in a week or month now. I have no idea how I'm going to store or organize all of these maps of the API sector, but it is something I'm sure I can find a solution for using my <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json format</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the type of work I really enjoy. It involves scaling what I do, better understanding what already exists out there, something that will fuel my storytelling, and is something that pushes me to code, and craft custom APIs, while also employing other open tooling, formats, and services along the way--this is API Evangelist.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2016</span>
        <p>I am continuing to work through notes from a recent push forward of my <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a>, and <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plan</a> research. Something that yielded a number of valuable nuggets &nbsp;that I think API providers should be considering when crafting their own strategy. <a href="https://auth0.com/pricing">One of the pricing pages I was looking at as part of my research, was from authentication provider Auth0, which provided a nice way for allowing their customers to toggle between monthly or annual pricing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://auth0.com/pricing"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/auth0-pricing-switch.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">I organize small elements like this, into my lists of common API building blocks, which help API providers, and API service providers, with a list of things they can consider applying in their own strategies</a>. I like the approach from Auth0 especially, because the toggle actually changes the plan pricing on the page, reflecting the shorter, or longer term costs associated with their authentication services.</p>
<p>Whether your intent is to offer price breaks for longer term relationships, or helping your customers better understand and manage their costs, a simple thing like a time-frame toggle, that adjusts pricing, could make a positive impact. Anyhoo, I just wanted to share this nugget with you, as I was adding it as a <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building block to my API plan research</a>.</p>

<p>I'm going to keep beating the patent API drumbeat, until I bring more awareness to the topic, and shine a light on what is going on. While I will still be my usual self and call out the worst behavior in the space, I am also going to try and be a little more friendlier around my views, and try and help bring more options to the table. This is a serious problem, nobody is talking about, and one that has many dimensions and nuances--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/27/my-stance-on-apis-and-patents/">if you want my raw stance on API patents, you can read it here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One area I wanted to try and cover, in response to my friends trying to convince me their aren't bad people, in having patents. I know you aren't, and it isn't my goal to make you look bad in this, it is only to shine light on the entire process, how broken it is, and call out the worst offenders. If you truly believe in patents, protecting the work you've done, and that your intentions are good, share your patent portfolio with the world, and showcase it like you do the other aspects of the work you do. You will craft a press release about everything else you do, do the same for your patents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not think patents are bad. I think ill-conceived patent ideas, that haven't been properly vetted by the under resourced USPTO, that are used in back door dealings as leverage, and litigated in a court of law are bad. I'll take your word that your patents are good, and you aren't operating in any of these areas, if you are public, transparent, and openly proud of them, as you state in private conversations.</p>
<p>Part of the purpose of my research is to encourage good behavior in the sector, by highlight the common building blocks of the space. I think I will add a patent portfolio building to my research. While I have ZERO examples to highlight, I encourage API companies to do this, and would love to highlight in a positive way, any company that is straight up enough to showcase their patents. If you are proud of your API patents, and do not have bad intentions in having them, please publish your portfolio, show case them as you would anything else you are doing--help bring API patents out of the shadows.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/parse-moving-on.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/">The mobile backend as a service (MBaaS) platform Parse is shutting down</a>. I started tracking on Parse as part of my BaaS research a couple years back, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/25/the-baas-reality-tv-show-panel-at-apistrat/">something that resulted in having all of the BaaS providers, including Ilya Sukhar (@) of Parse, on stage at @APIStrat NYC in early 2013</a>--this conversation was just a couple months before Parse was acquired by Facebook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parse was widely consider to be the top BaaS platform, which resulted in wide adoption, something that I'm sure grew expoentitally after the purchase by Facebook. Parse is giving everyone a year to migrate, <a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/introducing-parse-server-and-the-database-migration-tool/">providing a database migration tool</a>, as well as <a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/introducing-parse-server-and-the-database-migration-tool/">open sourcing a version of the platform</a>. Which I think is a pretty fair deprecation strategy for customers, even with the unexpected news.</p>
<p>Despite the tec highway is littered with these types of acquisitions, and deprecations, the tech blogosphere, and social bookmarkosphere (is that a word?), loves to sqawk when these happen. Competitors like AWS, Google, and others love to invite you to come use their platform, and the technorati love to point out how you cannot depend on any platform--which is the truth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoy taking these moments to explore why the space think technology is such an asbsolute, where these ways of thought rarely exist in other sectors<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/01/where-do-developers-get-idea-that-apis-should-never-go-away/">.</a>&nbsp;I think there are a couple distinct things at play:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Promises Of Tech Providers -</strong> In an effort to get new users, tech solution providers make some pretty wild promises of how they'll make your life easier, do all the hard work for you, all you have to do is just believe in them. Never mentioning you aren't really their true target customer, an acquisition by big tech company is their true customer.</li>
<li><strong>Religious Belief In Technology -</strong> Like the marketing of providers, developers, and other folks who drink the Silicon Valley Kool-Aid, really, really, really belive that technology is the answer, it will save us, and all of this is inevitable. Thus we believe the tech will always be there to save us, and are so willing to ignore the actual business and politics of all of this.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/01/where-do-developers-get-idea-that-apis-should-never-go-away/">As I've stated in earlier posts, there are no guarantees your vendors will will always be there in other business sectors, what the hell makes us think our tech vendors will always be there</a>? There is no basis for believing a platform or API will ALWAYS be there, no matter what you are promised. Companies go out of business, get acquired, and in this fast paced tech climate, companies are always looking to deliver the latest product, and features. Everything in the space points to disruption, change, and evolution, where the hell did we get the idea these services shouldn't go away?</p>
<p>I think the tech blogosphere, social&nbsp;bookmarkosphere, and startup elite and belivers should lower our expectations of technology just a little bit. ternet outages, acquisitions, and roadmap shifts will always happen--seems to me, these are the only constants! As a small business operator (I am not a startup), I am constantly evaluating what my Plan B, C, D, E, and even F is. While I may not always be prepared for changes in the landscape, rarely you will catch me squawking too loudly, as I'm business executing on the next stage of my evolution.</p>
<p>However, you will hear me exploring, and understanding these topics, as they occur--because that is fun, and educational!</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">If you caught my keynotes at @Defrag and @APIStrat last year, you know I'm working on using the subway map as a method for visualizing, understand, and eventually exploration of the API life cycle</a>. I feel like the subway map concept, has helped us find a globally universal way of understanding the transport of humans, via some very complex transportation systems, in cities around the globe--something I feel can be applied to world of APIs.</p>
<p>I was giving a version of my API life cycle talk to a group in Finland the other evening (their morning), and someone in the audience sent me <a href="http://liikenne.hylly.org/rata/lahi/">a link to the real-time subway map for Helsinki</a>. If you watch it closely, it updates based upon where the trains are, sharing times and locations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://liikenne.hylly.org/rata/lahi/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/helsinki-subway-map.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Click To See Real Interactive Map</em></p>
<p>This is what I'm working for across the API space. I see the subway map analogy being key to <a href="http://apievangelist.com">understanding our API life cycle, across the 40+ areas I track on in my research</a>, as well as a potential real-time window to understanding how each API is being used by employing <a href="http://3scale.net">modern API management infrastructure like 3Scale</a>.</p>
<p>API providers (which ALL companies will be shortly) should have real-time windows into where each of their vital API resources are in the life cycle, whether they are being designed, developed, managed or deprecated. We should also be able to experience real-time views of how are APIs are being consumed, which apps are currently making calls, and potentially even security threats against our API infrastructure.</p>
<p>The subway map is also providing me a way to educate new, and existing API folks in the space, providing them with an interactive journey within the design, definition, deployment, management, monitoring, <a href="http://apievangelist.com">and 40+ other areas of the API life cycle I keep an eye on</a>. I'm optimistic for what is possible, when it comes to applying the subway map concept to the world of APIs, but like earlier subway engineers, I think it will take some time before I fight just the right approach. ;-)</p>

<p>Supporting your community is not unique to the API space, but supporting API operations does have some unique needs, and approaches that are proven by leading platforms. Like other areas of my research, I'm pulling out API support into its own area, so I can start shining a light on successful patterns I find in the area of API support.</p>
<p>Two things pushed me to spin out this research area. One, I was tagging more blog posts, and other resources as support, and without a dedicated research area, this information would rarely float to the surface for me. Two, <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/hubs/help-desk-hub/">my partners over at Cloud Elements have an API hub dedicated to "Help Desk"</a>. While their aggregate API solution is targeting beyond the API community, it is API driven, and can also be applied to providing an aggregate support solution for API communities.</p>
<p>As with most of the areas of the API space, there are several dimensions to how APIs are being applied to support customers, and online communities. With my research, I will focus on tracking on approaches to community support for API providers, and API service providers. There will also be that layer of tracking on help desk and support platforms who employ APIs, as well as API aggregate and API interoperability solutions from leaders (and my partners) in the space like <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.apievangelist.com">You can visit my API support research via its Github repository</a>, and I will try to make sure and continue linking to it from my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API management research</a>, where it was born out of.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-certificate.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/12/i-just-cannot-get-behind-api-patents-especially-when-they-apply-to-http-and-hypermedia/">My post the other day on the hypermedia API focused patents from ElasticPath</a>, has resulted in some very interesting conversations, with folks trying to understand this world, to those who are patent believers, and those who are just doing what they have to--in a world they do not control. This is why I write these stories, and frankly, it is why I am looking to push the patent conversation to new levels, to bring all y'all out of the woodwork.</p>
<p>In a collective response to these conversations, I wanted to share my stance on patents, when it comes to the world of APIs. Let's start closer to the median, and talk about patents, and the world that "exists today", and explore the common responses when you look to discuss API patents in the current climate.</p>
<p><strong>I Do Not Want To Do Patents, I Only Do Them As a Defensive Response!</strong><br />C'mon Kin! You do not understand why we have to do patents. We only do them to protect our space, against the worst, of the worst in the tech space--you know SAP, Sun, Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, and the other evil that lurk (<a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/companies.html">the ones with most patents</a>). I get it. It is the same reason all my redneck, and now hippie friends own guns--those over there have guns, and I need to defend myself. You never know when one of those situations will happen, and I will need to defend what I've invested so much to build.</p>
<p><strong>I Need To Generate Intellectual Property (IP), Because It Is How We Define Value!</strong><br />If I could spend my time as I wish, I wouldn't be writing up patents, and spending money on the patent process. My investors, CEO, and my wider stakeholder's expect that, as a startup, I patent the most valuable of the exhaust from our operations. Ok. So you do this because the people who give you money tell you to? Or do you do this because it actually defines the value you generate as a startup? So, as a startup in 2015, a process acknowledged in ancient Greece, and evolved after the dark ages, and further refined in the industrial age, define you? Ok. #DisruptionW00T!</p>
<p><strong>Patents Are How You Make Money, Do You Know How Much Money IBM, Microsoft, SAP and Others Make?</strong><br />The amount of money the large enterprise make off their patent portfolios is in the BILLIONS! This is how business gets done, and fortunes are made! This is how the leading companies that we hold up as shining examples make their billions, so why wouldn't I follow in their footsteps? Well, you know, all that disruption, innovation, and other bullshit you hear--that is why! Actually its not, but I'm just trying to use your own marketing against you, to try and change your tune.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let's Start With The Basic Differences Between Your View, And My View Of The Space</strong><br />The concept of the patent process is about taking a unique and innovative process, locking it up, and preventing others from doing it. Which in a capitalist, physical world might make some sense, some of the time, but in a digital world it actually works against the way things actually operate--where reuse, interoperability, and global access is how you reach a wider audience, encourage ubiquitous integration, and yes make money (open source duh?). Locking things up, preventing others from using a successful pattern, and metering that usage doesn't get you as far in this digital world, as it did in the physical world of manufacturing and distribution. #Sorry</p>
<p>In conflict with your world of patents, I am in the business of opening things up, reducing friction, increasingly interoperability, educating more people, and making things work together. I like to make money, but in the end, I'm more in the business of making you money, than I am about making money--you just do not realize it. You are are so short sighted in your view of business, that you do not get what API is. You think SOA didn't work because of some technical flaw, and ignore the role your heavy hand has played in gumming up the gears. Only now are you noticing that API is even working, and you know what? It has nothing to do with you. It has been working because of your absence, and now that your heavy hand has come into play, trust me, shit will slow down. #GiveItTime</p>
<p><strong>The Patent Process Is Broken And Few Actually Care (Or Willing To Talk)</strong><br />The biggest thing that bothers me in taking my patent stance, and challenging the larger world of patents, is that the process is broken, and that many know, few care, and even fewer are willing to talk about it. Let's start with the basics, in that a process developed in the physical world, applied to physical processes, is transferable to the digital world with no adjustments. WTF! You will argue that taking an existing patent applied in the physical world, reapplied to web or mobile is now worthy of a new patent, but the patent process itself doesn't warrant the same response? WTF! #Broken. We could leave it there, but wait, there is more!</p>
<p><strong>The US Patent Office Is Underfunded, Undertrained, And OverWhelmed With Demand</strong><br />When you take the time to look through the work that goes into looking for prior works, you realize how little actually goes into the overall patent vetting process. Its less about invalidating an idea for a patent, than it is about make sure it gets approved. The USPTO is just one casualty in a larger war to defund the United States government, and part of the beautiful gift the 1% receives in waging this war. This the how power works. Weaken the process, defund the regulators, and give the power to those who own the patent. You are either smart and innovating, or you are a loser right? #VoteTrump</p>
<p><strong>Patents Are A Rich Persons Game, Something The Rest Of Us Should Avoid</strong><br />The patent game is for those with the resources, on the front-end and on the back-end. Do you have the time to carve out and define your patent, hire a lawyer to write and file your patent? Do you have the time to wait for the USPTO to approve your patent? Are you filing your patent, or is the company you work for filing the patent? You do!! Now do you have the time, and resources to defend your patent, upon attack by your enemies, in a court of law? A sustained attack? This is the two-sided beauty of how patents are a rich person game. You have to have what it takes to gneerate patents to please your VCs, and to defend against your perceived enemies, but do you also have what it takes to defend in the real world, in a court of law? I do not. Even if I could afford to patent my unique process on patenting APis, I couldn't litigate it ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Nobody Wants To Talk About Patents, Because Someday I Need Funding, Or Will Be In The Club</strong><br />Blogs like Techcrunch love to do gotcha stories, when it helps the cause of the powers that pull their strings, and similar publications will call foul when really scary patent related cases enters the legal system, but patent filing, and approved applications, in even the scariest of ways rarely make the news. As a patent filer or owner, you rarely talk about your patent portfolio publicly, let alone feed this information to news outlets, and interestingly, very few organizations go looking for this information. Hmmmm....</p>
<p><strong>Patent Conversations Happen Behind Closed Doors, Way Before They Ever Enter A Court Of Law</strong><br />When I hear the statement that patents are being filed in a defensive posture, focusing in on the legal battles that will no doubt come in the future, from the most aggressive in the space--I hear the passive aggressive tones from the shadows (takes one to know one). This statement leaves out the posturing that takes place behind closed doors, between executives, and investors. Do not tell me your patent portfolio, or perceived patent portfolio (patent pending) doesn't give you leverage in every day dealings, never even bringing litigation into the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Are Patents Sending The Signals You Think They Are In the Space</strong>&nbsp;<br />I just can't help but think that even though companies are playing the "patent game" by the rules, that they fully understand the signals they are sending. if I am watching the patent filings, and application approvals, and I know you are, don't you think your competition, and potential enemies are? Are you better off gaining a first mover advantage with your "unique process", or are you better off filing a patent for your process? IDK. I'm guessing this depends on how big your company is, and your general position in the space. Which means, I'm guessing it might not mean what you think it means for your little startup, and your view of the value vs. the view of your VC's might differ. Maybe it actually makes you a target for other types of bad behavior, and in the end, if necessary some actual patent litigation.</p>
<p><strong>Patents Are Like Guns, I'm Doing Them Because Everyone Else Is Doing Them</strong><br />Each time I listened to the stories of why my friends are doing patents over the last week, I think about the same stories I mentioned above from friends on why they have guns. Only difference is I have a long history with guns (love em), and not so much with patents. My friends have guns, because there are many other bad guys out there with guns, creating this really amazingly hostile environment, where nobody is safe. As a former thug, guess where you go rob when you see yourself as top tog in a market? You go rob the guys with all the guns, who might not have the resources to actually defend them. Guns have enjoyed much more "need" in the past, much like patents, but in the current climate we live in, we need to reassess their role, not do away with them, just take another look at the process involved--we should do the same with patents.</p>
<p><strong>Patent Trolls Is Just The Illness Coming To the Surface Of Tech Space</strong><br />The reason patent trolls can exist in this environment, is because of the buy / sell nature of companies, the scale at which the USPTO is equipped, government downsized, and coming down to who can actually afford the lawyers in the on-boarding, as well as offensive or defensive portion of the long patent game. If you have ever seen patent litigation play out, you know such a small portion of it is ever public, so what we hear publicly about the problem, is a very small piece of what is going on. This is just the part that plays out in the courtroom, and NEVER touches on what happens in the boardrooms of leading tech companies, or the investors behind the curtain.</p>
<p><strong>Now We Get To The Part Where You Actually Hear My Stance On The Patents As They Apply To APIs</strong><br />The concept of patent is broken, and the process that is patent is broken. For this reason I do not believe in it. Then you add the fact that it is a rich persons game, seals the deal for me. I cannot afford a patent, even if I wanted to, something that makes it an agent of power in my world. Something that also makes it such a hypocritical tell for startups. Why don't you push out press releases on your patents, that your VC's require you do? Alongside all of the innovation and disruption press releases? Oh yeah, we are using this really old process of the existing power structure. That is right, we aren't actually that proud of our patents--unless we work for IBM.</p>
<p><strong>I Cannot Support This Concept Moving Forward If Nobody Will Stand Up And Fight To Evolve It</strong><br />As a startup you will dismiss history, so that you can disrupt, find your funding, and convince all of us that your thing, is a thing. Government, banks, unions, institutions, and other entrenched entities are bad, and need disrupting in a digital era, but this centuries old process of locking of business processes, developing intellectual property, and building wealth portfolio deserves NO CHANGE in a digital age? WTF? Are you serious? The same concept applied to the cotton gin, applies to my cotton gin API? Don't even think about it, I've already applied for the patent! ;-) Sorry, I'm just not sold.</p>
<p>I understand why you are doing this, and I will keep accepting your requests to talk about, because I learn a lot along the way, and it is something that continues to anchor me in my stance. You will look to quickly dismiss me because I am not "playing in your league", and I don't understand the stakes, and the rules of the game. #Truth. I would also challenge that maybe you are so caught up in the stakes and rules of your game, you might be missing some opportunity, and potentially a whole other way of operating--one that actually makes all of this work, and less about you getting rich.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://apimatic.io"></a><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/apimatic-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm seeing a resurgence in my <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">embeddable API research</a> lately, based upon signals I'm seeing across the space, and conversations I'm having with folks. The interesting part for me is that this wave isn't about API providers like Twitter and Faceobok using JavaScript to create buttons, badges, and widgets. This latest round is about API service providers making their services more accessible to both API providers, and API consumers, using embeddable tooling, and most importantly, <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a>.</p>
<p>API driven embeddable tools comes in many shapes and sizes, but is something I work hard to understand, and track on in the space. I have several new embeddable stories to talk about this week, but today's is from my friends over at <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a>, as well as <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary</a>. The two service providers now offer the ability to embed your APIMATIC driven SDKs, into your Apiary driven API documentation. All you do, is plug in the URL of your Apiary portal page for your API, into your APIMATC account, and you are returned embeddable markdown you can paste into your Apiary API documentation--Apiary addresses your API design, documentation, testing and virtualization needs, and APIMATIC comes is with the API SDK assist.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://apimatic.io/account/manage/apiary"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apimatic-apiary-embed.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I like API service providers working together like this, it is something that makes API provider's and API consumer's lives easier. This approach to API service interoperability is what it will take to weave together the patchwork of API services that will be needed across the API life cycle. As more API service providers emerge to fill gaps in the life cycle, the ability to stitch these stops will grow more critical, something embeddability will contribute to. Depending on a single provider in 2016, is just not a reality, and I need the services that I depend on to work together.</p>
<p>As I will work to showcase in future stories, embedability comes in many shapes and sizes. I'm hoping we are on the cusp of a new wave of <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">API driven embeddability</a>, one that is exponentially more fruitful, and easier to implement for each individual API provider. An approach to using JavaScript and image driven embeddability, that uses APIs like previous waves, but this one is more designed for API providers, API consumers, as well as for end-users, like historical approaches to embed like Twitter tweet buttons, and Facebook share and login buttons were.</p>

        <p><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cl74hjb3vikaorq1o506seejl7s">I held a hangout with API Evangelist this morning</a>, with Steve Willmot (<a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/njyx"><span>@</span>njyx</a>)<span> of </span><a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/3scale"><span>@</span>3scale</a><span>, &amp; Jakub Nesetril (</span><a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/jakubnesetril"><span>@</span>jakubnesetril</a>)<span> of </span><a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/apiaryio"><span>@</span>apiaryio</a><span>&nbsp;today, where we discussed API definitions. Both Steve and Jakub are CEOs of leading tech companies, who are taking frontline positions when it comes to the whole API definition conversation.</span></p>
<p>My role in this hangout, was just bringing together these two API leaders, to discuss the most important topic facing us in the world of APIs. API definitions are touching on every aspect of the API life cycle, and as Steve and Jakub discuss, playing a central role in their businesses, and their customer's businesses. We published the hour and half conversation on Youtube, so you can join in, even if you couldn't make the hangout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OrGPHBQ4dGo" width="560" height="315" align="center"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus on API definitions being the contract, was the most important part of today's hangout for me. This wasn't a conversation about just Swagger, or API Blueprint, it was a discussion about the role API definitions play in the API life cycle, from the latest wave of API description formats like Swagger and Blueprint, to API discovery formats like APIs.json, and even media types, and schemas. These are the contracts we are using to communicate our ideas, generate code, setup tests, drive documentation, and make the API economy go roudn.</p>
<p>This hangout was scheduled to be an hour, but there was so much to cover, we took it an extra 30 minutes. The conversation left me feeling like I need to do this more often, expanding on the API definition discussion, but also push into other important areas like API deployment, virtualization, discovery, monitoring, and the other almost 40 areas of the API lifecycle I track on. We'll see how much time i have to do these, but more importantly my ability to bring smart people like Steve and Jakub together--something I hope I can make it work.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jakub and Steve for participating today!</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-reverse-engineer.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">As I work to complete more API definitions, with all API endpoints defined as an OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, and Postman Collection, with everything wrapped in a complete APIs.json index</a>--I can't help but consider the importance of these definitions in helping others reverse engineer these APIs, to help apply in their own API design, development, and management processes.</p>
<p>Whether or not you are learning about an API for consumption purposes, or learning about it from a providers perspective, there is a lot to learn from APIs that are defined using&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a>, <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections">Postman Collection</a>, and is something I'm working to push <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json to deliver on more</a>. Right now I'm struggling to just get the basics of each API, its individual methods, parameters, and underlying schemas. I am also working to index their overall operations using APIs.json. Soon though, I will reach the point where I will have a nice collection of existing APIs defined, I will be able to do much, much more--this is what I'm planning for now.</p>
<p>Now that I am closing in on having a couple hundred, complete (enough) API definitions for leading platforms, I think I will take another look through the stack, and evaluate how I can position them better to help potential API consumers, as well as API providers. API consumers are going to care about learning only what they need to get at the valuable resources made available via the API, while providers are going to want to better understand the API design, schemas, business models, and other aspects of the operations.</p>
<p>I'm thinking more deeply the API provider and API consumer sides of the same coin, so when you land on the home page of any API service provider, there is personalized, easy to use, visual elements that draw you in to learn more about an existing API you already know about. Want to learn how to connect to APIs using Postman, here is a Twitter guide. Want to learn more about designing a file storage API using Apiary, here is a Dropbox guide. There is no reason that these common guides could be easily available in the tooling we use everyday, and be driven by APIs.json, OpenAPI Spec, and API Blueprint.To help illustrate my point, I am going to pick 10 of the most well known APIs, and craft examples of what I am talking about. Blueprints that could be used in any service, as easily provide reverse engineering lessons from the home page, dashboards, and help sections we are using each day. I learn a lot about APIs from reverse engineering the API definitions of leading APIs, and hoping others will too.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-a.png" alt="" width="50" align="right" /></p>
<p>There are many inconsistencies I struggle with in the API space, and the lack of meaningful icons to express myself is one of them. I was meeting with my friend Jerome Louvel of <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a> this last week, and he also articulated (again), the lack of imagery that represents APIs. To understand what we are talking about simple icons, like what RSS has, but to represent an API, instead of an XML feed.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-image.png" alt="" width="50" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I need an image to represent an API, I always borrow the simple icon from the <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>. Like my API Evangelist logo, it is a pretty simple, black and white, minimum viable representation of "API". The folks over at Restlet also have their own, image, that they use across the platform, and suggested it as one potential design that could be used. This is a concept that I would like to push forward. I think branding, and iconography is very important, and is something long overdue for the API space.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-industry-icons.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>I would like to see a single universal, community driven icon to represent the concept of a web API. I would also like to see similar icons for formats used across the space, as well as vendor specific icons. If you look at <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">my personal API stack</a>, as well as <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">my overall stack</a>, you see me using a mix of format, and vendor icons to document a pretty complex assortment of API driven resources, and information. I'd like to step this up a bit, be able to standardize across not just my network of sites, but the overall API community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am guessing this is something I will have to slowly push forward, like the numerous other areas of my API industry research, but would love to hear your input, and see what else we could do to establish a common set of API industry icons. I'm already working with a handful of API vendors to define their <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">API driven embeddable strategy</a>, and looking to push forward <a href="http://branding.apievangelist.com">my API branding research</a>, so I wanted to make sure and publish a story on this--which in my world is essential to the ideation process, and essential to moving anything forward.</p>

<p>Join me, Steve Willmott(<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) of <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">3Scale</a>, and Jakub Nesetril(<a href="https://twitter.com/jakubnesetril">@jakubnesetril</a>) of <a href="http://apis.how/ohgw3uqjt0">Apiary</a>, for a hangout on API definitions this week. I wanted to explore&nbsp; doing more hangouts under the APIStrat, as well as API Evangelist brand(s)--for this one I wanted to bring together some experts to talk about the fast moving world of API definitions, as a <a href="http://hangoutwith.apievangelist.com/">Hangout with API Evangelist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://hangouts.apistrat.com/">This Wednesday, January 27th, at 11:00 AM PST, the three of us will jump on a Google Hangout</a>, and you are welcome to join in the conversation. We will be doing the gathering as a Hangout on Air, so that you can ask questions if you want, joining in the live conversation, or you can wait until after we are done, I will make sure and publish the video to Youtube.</p>

<p>Its a pretty important time for API definitions with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">the Swagger specification reborn as the OpenAPISpec</a>, and Apiary, the creator of API Blueprint and MSON, <a href="http://blog.apiary.io/2016/01/18/We-ve-got-Swagger/">also adopting OpenAPI Spec this last week, allowing you to design and mock your API in both formats</a>. 3Scale was an earlier adopter of Swagger, and <a href="http://www.3scale.net/tag/swagger/">has taken a leadership position in shepherding it to into the Linux Foundation, and is a member of the governance working group</a>.</p>
<p>I figured that it is a pretty good time to check-in with Steve and Jakub, on the current state of API definitions, and how they see them impacting their own platforms, as well as the overall API space. If you have any specific questions you'd like me to ask, or have any specific topics you'd like to see discussed, feel free to tweet at me. <a href="http://hangoutwith.apievangelist.com">I'll tweet out the link for the event, but all you need to do is visit hangoutwith.apievangelist.com, this Wednesday at 11:00 PST, and join in the conversation</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/lucybot/lucy-console">I am happy to be showcasing a new open source, OpenAPI Spec driven, interactive API documentation, from the LucyBot team</a>. The API definition driven documentation solution is one of the best implementations I've seen to date, and reflects the future of where API documentation should be going in my opinion. While the <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a> has significantly moved the API documentation conversation forward, it has never been the most attractive solution, pushing some API providers to use a more attractive, less interactive, open source solution from <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">Slate</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://lucybot.com/console_demo/">LucyBot API Console</a> is both! It is API definition driven, using the <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a> as its engine, but also <a href="https://github.com/lucybot/api-spec-converter">provides a conversion tool for RAML, WADL, or API Blueprint</a>. The LucyBot API Console is also very attractive, responsive, and flows much like Slate does, but goes much further by being an actual interactive API console, not just good looking, static docs. You can see Lucy Console in action <a href="https://any-api.com/">over at AnyAPI</a>, or as <a href="https://lucybot.com/console_demo/">a small set that demonstrates different CSS variations</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/lucy-console">I have forked</a>, and started playing with the <a href="https://lucybot.com/console_demo/">LucyBot API Console</a> more--I encourage you to do the same. There are a number of features I'd like to see in there, like more embeddability, and templability of the UI, as well as some APIs.json support, and D3.js visualization integration--so I wil be getting more knowledgeable of the code base, and in tune with the road map. I know the LucyBot team is open sourcing the code to encourage contributions, and are looking for investment in dev and business resources to move the project forward--so get involved!</p>
<p>It is good to see the <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition</a> driven <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com">API documentation</a> conversation moving forward in 2016!</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-abstraction-2.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was on the road last week, so I didn't maintain my usual barrage of API analysis. As I go through my monitoring for the week, I'd say <a href="http://blog.apiary.io/2016/01/18/We-ve-got-Swagger/">the biggest news of the week was Apiary's support of the OpenAPI Spec</a>. I got a test drive of the support for the API definition format over the holidays, and was impressed with how smoothly Apiary integrated the <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a> into their <a href="http://apis.how/ohgw3uqjt0">API design, virtualization, and management platform</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another very interesting dimension of the Apiary release for me, was how they seamlessly integrated the new API definition into their road map. This wasn't a switch to the OpenAPI Spec from API Blueprint, it was about opening up, embracing, and abstracting away of multiple API definition formats across their platform operations. As an API service provider, it is just smart business to support as many possible API definition formats as you possibly can. The 2016 road map for Apiary acknowledges the value of using the OpenAPI Spec, but still reflects the strengths that <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> + <a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/mson">MSON</a> bring to the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/28/we-need-an-open-abstraction-layer-to-help-us-better-define-and-design-our-apis/">Last September, I walked around San Francisco with Jakub Nesetril (@jakubnesetril), the CEO of Apiary, talking about the need for an open abstraction layer to help us better define our API, across all stops of the API life cycle</a>. This wee's OpenAPI Spec support at Apiary is Jakub's vision playing out, making sure the process of defining your APIs across the design, virtualization, and management areas of your API life cycle is as robust, and agile as it possibly can be. For me, this makes this weeks news much more than about Apiary abstracting away the complexity of switching between leading API definitions, than it is about their support for the OpenAPI Spec.</p>
<p>I had beers with Emmanuel Paraskakis(<a href="https://twitter.com/manp">@manp</a>) and Jakub at the Toronado on Haight Street in San Francisco this week, and had another conversation with them about their abstraction layer, which helps them efficiently switch between using API Blueprint and OpenAPI Spec in Apiary. They expressed interest in exploring the open sourcing of this layer, to help others achieve similar abstraction in their own platforms. During our talk Jakub reiterated his earlier vision of an open abstraction layer, where each API definition provider(OpenAPI Spec, RAML, Postman, APIs.json, etc) can maintain theri own plugins, abstracting away this work for API service providers.</p>
<p>Consider the opportunities when any API service provider in the community, serving any stop along the API life cycle, can seamlessly integrate this abstraction layer into their platform. Where they can work with a single API definition layer, which navigates the differences between each individual API definition, and the owner of each definition has to step up and maintain the individual API definition side of the equation. If you are selling your services to API providers across the sector, you should support as many of the leading API definitions formats as you can, and what Apiary is cooking up, will make this reality much easier to achieve.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/">My API industry research is constantly moving forward, shifting, and being added to--much like the space itself</a>. As I work to update each of my research areas each week, my process involves adding any news I've curated, and changes to the companies who are doing things in the space, as well as add or remove any common building blocks I've identified. These building blocks are the common patterns I've identified by studying how API providers are operating, and what features API service providers are bringing to the table, for API providers to put to work.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">This last fall, in preparation for my keynotes at Defrag and APIStrat, I pushed forward much of my research, flushing out more of the building blocks across 20+ of my research areas</a>. As I was preparing for another big push forward with my research, I wanted to stop and take a snapshot of just what I'd consider to be the essential building blocks across the most mature areas of my API monitoring research.</p>
<p>I track almost 1000 stops along the modern API life cycle, but this snapshot represents what I'd consider to be a master list that API providers, and service providers should be considering as they design, develop, manage, and execute on almost 20 other areas of a modern API lifecycle. This snapshot is meant to be a guide to what I'm seeing in the space, which can be used as a checklist, in your own API strategy. I do not recommend every company do every thing listed in this document, but they are elements that you should be considering, and hopefully have a better understanding of.</p>
<p>Like my other guides, this one is in beta. I'm adding a couple new areas to my research in January that will impact this work, and I will also be exposing links to other companies, services, and resources that support each building block. You can <a href="http://apis.how/3logs6w2yo">download via a PDF version</a>, or <a href="http://essential.apievangelist.com/">access via its own Github repository</a>. If you see any mistakes, you are welcome to correct them there, and submit a pull request, or simply <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/essential-building-blocks/issues">submit an issue</a> to let me know, via the <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/essential-building-blocks">Github repo</a>. I will roll any edits into the next edition.</p>
<p>While not as short as I'd hope it to be, <a href="http://essential.apievangelist.com/">I think the essential API building guide across these 20+ areas of my research provides an interesting snapshot of the space in 2016</a>. Stay tuned...more to come.</p>

<p>I just finished spending an hour talking with&nbsp;Brent Baker (<a href="https://twitter.com/norcaljhawk">@norcaljhawk</a>), head of product for <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/">Dwolla</a>, and Jordan Lampe (<a href="https://twitter.com/JsLampe">@JsLampe</a>), about the vision behind the developer experience for their <a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/">new developer portal</a>. I will be able to craft many stories from the notes I generated during our conversation, but there was one aspect of how they view consumers of their <a href="https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#transfers">ACH transfer API</a>, I wanted to quickly share.</p>
<p>This portion part of our conversation came up when they mentioned how they broke up their API users, as they were rethinking the overall developer experience. They put API consumers into four distinct categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>seeker</strong> - individual looking for a solution</li>
<li><strong>implementer</strong> - individual implementing solution</li>
<li><strong>maintainer</strong> - individual maintaining solution</li>
<li><strong>hacker</strong> - individual playing with their solution</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is a great way to look at your API consumers. I've heard many different approaches to labeling your API consumer buckets, but I'd say this is the first time that I've heard it put so elegantly. A moment I couldn't help but ruin, by selfishly adding:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>analyst</strong> - individual looking to understand role solution plays in big picture</li>
</ul>
<p>You can't forget about us analyst types who will just talk about your APIs, and rarely actually do any "real work". ;-) Anyways, I just wanted to share this small part of our conversation. The Dwolla developer portal experience is rich with <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API management</a> examples, that other API providers should be looking to emulate. I will keep processing the notes from our conversation, and share any other nuggets I collected during my walk through the API journey the Dwolla team has crafted within their new&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/">API portal</a>.</p>

<p>One of the benefits of doing an API, is so that you can take advantage of the potential for a community feedback loop, driven by internal groups, external partners, and even in some cases the pubic. Under <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">my API management research, you can find a number of building blocks I recommend for helping power your feedback loop</a>, but sometimes I like to just showcase examples of this in the wild, to show how it all can work.</p>
<p>I was reading the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.practicefusion.com/blog/2016-product-vision/">Letter from our co-founder: 2016 Product vision</a>, from <a href="http://www.practicefusion.com">Electronic Health Record (EHR) provider Practice Fusion</a>, and I thought the heart of the blog post, represented a well functioning feedback loop. As Practice Fusion looked back over 2015, they noted the following activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>798&nbsp;<a href="http://knowledgebase.practicefusion.com/forums/276361-product-ideas">product ideas submitted</a>&nbsp;with over 3,000 comments.</li>
<li>64&nbsp;<a href="http://knowledgebase.practicefusion.com/forums/276361-product-ideas/status/1466105">community ideas already delivered</a>&nbsp;as product features.</li>
<li>45&nbsp;<a href="http://knowledgebase.practicefusion.com/forums/276361-product-ideas/status/1417611">new ideas currently being worked on</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Acknowledging that this feedback <em>"powers everything we do"</em>. They continue listing some of the major customer requests that were fulfilled in 2015, and close the letter with an "eye towards the future". It is a simple, but nice example of how a platform's community can drive the platform road map. Sure a lot of this comes from the SaaS side of the Practice Fusion operations, but it works in sync with the <a href="https://developer.practicefusion.com/">Practice Fusion developer community</a> as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lesson from this one, to include in my overall research, is to always have a way to collect feedback from the community, tag ideas for discussion as potential additions to the road map, and carefully track on which ideas get delivered, and which ones end up being included in the road map. This is something that is pretty easy to do with Github Issue Management, which I use for my own personal projects, to drive both my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/roadmap/">road maps</a>, and resulting <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/change-log/">change logs</a>.</p>
<p>This post also pushed me to begin tagging these types of stories, organizing them into a simple API playbook, full of API platform how-tos, like this product vision letter from co-founder of <a href="http://www.practicefusion.com/">Practice Fusion</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/slate/slate-tripit.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was just talking API documentation with&nbsp;Brent Baker (<a href="https://twitter.com/norcaljhawk">@norcaljhawk</a>), and Jordan Lampe (<a href="https://twitter.com/JsLampe">@JsLampe</a>) from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dwolla.com/">Dwolla</a>. As we were going through their API documentation, they mentioned how they were using <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">Slate</a> for the version 1.0 of their API documentation, but for this round they took what they felt were just the best parts of Slate, and were looking to craft a new experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/24/dwolla-using-slate-for-an-evolved-api-documentation-experience/">I had written about their use of Slate for API docs back in 2014</a>, so it makes sense for me to keep tracking on, but more importantly I think the move reflects the wider evolution of API documentation. If you aren't familiar with Slate, it is a very attractive way to document your APIs, that many API providers and consumers have latched on to. Slate, in contrast to the very utilitarian style of Swagger UI, has certain elements developer prefer--something I can see why, after looking at a lot of API docs.</p>
<p>Dwolla's evolution from their old static API docs to Slate, and then<a href="https://docsv2.dwolla.com/"> to their current version</a>&nbsp;highlighted two important aspects of the modern API documentation evolution for me. First, the feedback to the Dwolla team revealed that the three column format which Slate used for documentation, made the documentation seem like it was not part of the overall Dwolla experience--it was separate. Which is one unique thing Swagger UI did, is that allowed it to be embedded within any API portal, even though the look was not as attractive as Slate is.</p>
<p>As they evolve overall their portal experience, <a href="http://dwolla.org">Dwolla</a> was sure they wanted to keep the code sample viewer, which allows for inline viewing of raw, PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript samples for each API. In rethinking their API docs, the Dwolla team wanted to decouple the three-pane experience, but keep the attractiveness, flowing navigation, and inline language sample experience that Slate delivered--keeping just the best parts of the increasingly ubiquitous API documentation format.</p>
<p>For me this highlights some of the elements, the latest wave of API documentation developers, like <a href="https://any-api.com/">Any API</a>, may want to consider as they help push forward the overall API documentation conversation. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/25/we-should-be-generating-slate-from-swagger-so-we-maintain-a-machine-readable-core/">Any API did what I wanted to see, and combined the interactive functionality of Swagger UI, and the clean UI / UX that Slate brought to the table</a>. I recommend to anyone crafting the next generation of API documentation solutions, consider the overall layout, making things more decoupled, responsive, and allowing of more embeddability of all, or even just portions of the API documentation--making the API documentation experience more portable, and re-mixable.</p>
<p>Even though I'm not seeing everything I would like to when it comes to the evolution of API documentation, I am optimistic about what I am seeing, and my conversation with the Dwolla team shows me there is a lot of positive momentum forward in how leading API providers are really thinking about what matters, when it comes to API documentation.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Jan 2016</span>

<p>I got an email in my inbox, <a href="https://developers.elasticpath.com/labs-helix">about a new API modeling language from Elastic Path earlier today</a>. The product is called Helix, and is sold as being <em>"the first enterprise-class API modeling language designed specifically for REST Level 3"</em>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Elastic Path team is where I first learned about the concept of hypermedia, I believe back in 2011--honestly, I had heard the concept before, but never fully grasped what it was, and the potential until 2011 (I know I am slow). However it has been an awareness that has grown rapidly, the more I learn about hypermedia, study how people are practicing hypermedia, and even dabble in it myself with my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/11/applying-a-little-hypermedia-is-helping-me-tighten-down-my-api-design-and-tell-a-better-api-story/">curation</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/02/realizing-i-need-hypermedia-to-bring-my-api-lifecycle-vision-to-life/">building block APIs</a>.</p>
<p>Elastic Path is an expert in the area of hypermedia, so it makes sense they would step up with some hypermedia focused API tooling, and even a modeling language. No surprises here, but where I was a little surprised, was when I read the "Why Helix":</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Elastic Path built Helix because existing API modeling languages, such as RAML, Swagger, and API Blueprint, while good for describing standard APIs, are not well suited to designing hypermedia APIs. Elastic Path Cortex, our patented API technology, utilizes Helix definitions and a Helix-compatible implementation, allowing our partners and customers to extend existing APIs and quickly create new ones.</em></p>
<p><span>After reading, I wanted to explore the portion of their description that states, <em>"Elastic Path Cortex, our patented API technology, utilizes Helix definitions and a Helix-compatible implementation, allowing our partners and customers to extend existing APIs and quickly create new ones."</em>, but specifically the<em> "patented API technology"</em>. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=pts&amp;hl=en&amp;q=inassignee:%22Elastic+Path+Software,+Inc.%22">Something a quick Google Patent search discovers as defined five separate patents held by Elastic Path</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Hmmmmmm.....</strong></p>
<p>I know you all think I'm some hippie dippie API dude, who doesn't get all this VC driven, business shit you are all calling startups, and innovation, and you are probably right. However, I'd argue that many of all you really do not get this Internet, or API thing either. This is a hard one for me, because I've worked with Elastic Path since way back in API Evangelist history, and I personally know and love their team. So its hard for me to call bullshit on this, but I have to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not all the way through the detail of the patents, but in my opinion, they should never have been approved. They go against everything that is the Internet, and why APIs work. The only thing I see unique in the patent titles, abstracts, and art, is the term "microkernel". Not sure exactly what that is, but the rest of it sounds like what we are all already doing with APIs to me--correct me if I am wrong?</p>
<p>Luckily patents are coming back onto my radar, thanks to my lovely partner in crime doing the research for her piece,&nbsp;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2016/01/12/patents/">Ed-Tech Patents: Prior Art and Learning Theories</a>. Her work, and this release from Elastic Path is encouraging me to <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">spend some fresh time going through my patent research</a>, and make sure that I am paying attention to this type of stuff in real-time. I started my dive last January, making it a perfect time to refresh my research in the area.</p>
<p>I swear, with the Oracle v Google, last years Swagger bullshittery, and now this, y'all are going to turn API into SOA, and then everyone is gonna be whining at me that I promised this API thing would work!! Luckily someone will come along with the next thing to sell you fuckers, make money, and y'all can fuck that up too. #IFuckingQuit!</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-trusted-apps-and-users.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was emailed by someone working in government, asking some pretty interesting questions around using an application showcase, to make trusted applications available to an ecosystem of partners. I'm not going to talk specifically about the agency, as I have not gotten approval to talk publicly, but I think the question is an interesting mix of several areas I am researching, that I wanted to explore a little further, in an anonymous fashion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a a heavily edited, summarized version of what was asked, but it essentially went like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There are 400 apps that want to get data from an organization but only some portion of them meet or exceed the governance criteria to be deemed &ldquo;trustworthy&rdquo;. &nbsp;This usually involves certain legal commitments are followed and other privacy requirements are satisfied--these 400 apps that will be evaluated, and if they qualify, they will be put into the an application registry. Another aspect of it is that rather than each of the 400 apps having to go to each of the partners to get authorized and access the partners API that it would be more efficient to rely on the application registry to determine if they can expose their APIs to that apps request(s) as well.</em></p>
<p>Application showcases, that share approved applications with an ecosystem is common, but what I found interesting about this agencies question is that they want to also use the application approval process, as a sign of trust for other partners, when it comes to accessing their own API resources. As I said, this conversation spans three key areas of what I'm seeing occur modern API ecosystems:</p>
<ul>
<li>3rd Party Applications (ie. approval, showcase, case studies, etc.)</li>
<li>Partner Programs (i.e. certification, access tiers, etc.)</li>
<li>Service Composition (ie. plans, monetization, rate limiting, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">Modern approaches to API planning</a>, and well thought-out <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API driven partner programs</a>, provide the approaches you need to approve partners (ie. companies), and the applications they build. Then your service composition, <a href="http://3scale.net">using API management infrastructure 3Scale</a>, is how you craft the partner tiers of access, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/easier-to-offer-ops-apis-to-your-devs-if-your-api-service-provider-has-apis/">provide the API infrastructure APIs to your partners</a> for knowing which applications, have which levels of access. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/03/what-is-api-service-composition/">I've written about service composition many times</a>, but my <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/">partner research is just getting going</a>, so I wanted to take a&nbsp;look at the API pioneers, as potential blueprints in these areas--let's start with Amazon's approach:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/">Amazon Certification</a></strong> (individuals)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/">Amazon Partner Network</a></strong> (groups, software)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see both the individual, and group level offer several layers of certification, depending on individual, as well as the software being sold (ie. government, hardware, AWS marketplace, SaaS, etc). &nbsp;For some more examples of partner programs, I am taking a look at&nbsp;<a href="http://certification.salesforce.com/">Salesforce with their certification program</a>, the <a href="http://cgi6.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SolutionsDirectory">Ebay&rsquo;s Solutions Directory</a>, with&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/general/official-partner-program">Twitter's official Partner Program</a>, over at <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/marketingpartners">Facebook with their Marketing Partners program</a>, and the <a href="http://developer.edmunds.com/certified-dev.html">Edmunds Certified Developer Network</a>, for a start.</p>
<p>I felt this conversation provided me an interesting look on certifying partners (companies, organizations, agencies, individuals), and the software integration(s) they produce (app showcase, directory, etc.), then using that as a trust driver for your API service composition for your own platform, but also extending that identity, trust, and authentication for your partners to use in their own API service composition.</p>
<p>The application showcase portion of this story is interesting, but I think the use of partner program certification, and extending this to your partners, so that they can use in their API service is unique. Something that is totally possible, i<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/27/which-api-service-providers-across-the-20-areas-i-track-on-have-apis/">f your API management, planning, and partner layers all have APIs</a>. You can then use your infrastructure APIs, provide facades for your partners to access users, applications, partner program details, and other aspects of API operations, in a seamless way using APIs. *mind blown*</p>

<p>API Evangelist has long been dedicated to helping the average business user understand all that is API. I saw early on in 2010, the potential of APIs, when used to empower the IT, or even shadow IT of the average business user. I think I've done well in this mission, except for one thing, the API Evangelist network is heavily focused on providing APIs, and much more lighter on topics and information around consuming APIs--something I will be working hard to shift over the next five years.</p>
<p>To help me tackle this, is my new partner <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a>. I do not partner with organizations, unless they help fuel my research, and Cloud Elements is helping me pushing forward several areas including <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">API aggregation</a>, <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API reciprocity</a>, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/30/here-are-the-top-api-stacks-i-will-be-working-to-define-in-2016/">pushing me to profile 50 of the top business sectors</a>. While these areas of my research will have lots of information for API providers, many of the companies, services, and tooling I profile in these areas will be about empowering API consumers, and even more importantly--all types of API consumers, not just developers.</p>
<p>Services like IFTTT and Zapier, make APIs accessible to the average business user because they allow them to move things around in the cloud using APIs. API service providers like Cloud Elements are allowing the average user to not just move things around in a way that protects their interest, and the interest of platforms (aka reciprocity), but they also all for aggregation, automation, and orchestration, of critical business "life bits" like documents, contacts, and images. This is why I seek out partners like them, to work in concert to better understand the space, but also tell stories that help average business user solve their actual problems. #winwin</p>
<p>You will hear me talk a lot about what <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a> is doing in 2016. Partly because they give me money, yes, but also because they are giving me money to operate, and spend my time researching how APIs can be put to work by the average business, and telling more stories that focus on API consumption. <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a>, and <a href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a> have helped me push forward my API provider focused research, and I look forward to helping balance the API consumer side of the scales through my partnership with Cloud Elements.</p>
