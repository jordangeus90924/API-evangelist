{% include JB/setup %}<p>This is one story Im sure I will be telling over and over.Its about providing self-service registration to your API, and access to your documentation.Im working my way through 78 travel APIs right now, reviewing each of them for a series of travel industry API stories.Im only halfway through, and about 25% of them require me to email them or submit a contact form to get access to their API.I can understand doing this if your goal is to only work with partners and vendors, but all of these APIs came from the ProgrammableWeb API directory.</p>
