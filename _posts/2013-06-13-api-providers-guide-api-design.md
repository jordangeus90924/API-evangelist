{% include JB/setup %}<p>Download as PDF In the early days, APIs were just about deployment and consumption--you were doing one or the other.  Then from 2006 to 2012 API management was introduced from providers like Mashery, then 3Scale and most recently Apiphany.In 2013 the API universe is expanding at a ever increasing pace, and the concept of API design is expanding, with new approaches, tools and even companies stepping up to provide services.Im deciding to frame my API design research as everything that goes into planning and designing your API, as well as the resulting definition of your API, that will eventually become the  API you will use in production, which also might drive your documentation and generate the code samples your developers will use to integrate their apps.Depending on our needs, API design may begin with learning about HATEOAS as part of your design constraints, or API design might simply be about generating a Swagger definition so you can generate interactive API documentation.</p>
