Sentiment analysis and social media analytics API provider [Repustate][1] is providing a [virtualized, portable, on-premise version of its API][2]\--adding a new twist to the concept of API deployment.

Using this new approach, Repustate is targeting the 5% of their user base who do not wish to transmit their data across the Internet, possibly because of legal or security concerns, and providing them with an on-premise version of their API, configured as a portable virtual appliance.

While the concept of on-premise vs cloud is nothing new, packaging up your API as a virtual appliance that can run anywhere is not that common. I'm investigating various, emerging [approaches to deploying virtual containers][3] that can assist API providers in providing portable versions of their valuable API resources.

At this point, I'm not sure how much demand there is for on-premise API resources, but I could see huge potential for the deployment of [virtualized API stacks][4] within a corporate firewall, enough that I will keep highlighting interesting approaches like Repustates, and providing blueprints for designing and deploying virtualized API containers and appliances.
