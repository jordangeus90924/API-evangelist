<p>The Tumblr engineering team has been hard at work on a new Github page, showcasing the <a href="https://tumblr.github.com/#code">open source projects they've released</a>. &nbsp;
<p>Tumblr has also added a <a href="https://tumblr.github.com/#coming-soon">coming soon section,</a> highlighting open source projects they are planning on releasing in the near future.
<p>What's interesting is they have also included <a href="https://tumblr.github.com/#presentations">select presentations from conferences and events Tumblr has presented at</a>.&nbsp;
<p>The <a href="https://tumblr.github.com/">Github implementation by Tumblr</a> is pretty unique, and to go even further, Tumblr has also&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/tumblr/tumblr.github.com">open sourced their whole approach to deploying it on Github</a>.

<p>Tumblr's use of Github is worth showcasing. &nbsp;I think it's an innovative approach that other API owners could follow to showcase the open source project they are working on, as well as valuable event presentations.
<p>I'm really impressed with the number of innovative uses of <a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> I'm seeing lately.
