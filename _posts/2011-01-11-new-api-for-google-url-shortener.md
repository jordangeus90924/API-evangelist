<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-url-shortner-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Google launched a much anticipated API for the Google URL shortener today as part of the [Google Code Labs][1].

The Google URL Shortener at goo.gl is a service that takes long URLs and squeezes them into fewer characters to make a link that is easier to share, tweet, or email to friends.

The Google URL Shortener API allows you to interact with the service via a RESTful interface, and returns JSON data structures. Here is the [API Overview][2], as well as the [Getting Started Guide][3].

Google has added to its new API console allowing developers to explore and get familiar with the API interface quickly.
