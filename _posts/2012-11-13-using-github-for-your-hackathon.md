{% include JB/setup %}<p>Hackathons are a fertile environment for generating code based upon the ideas of its attendees.However, much of the innovative programming that occurs at these events is forgotten the day after the event ends.This process tends to leave developers working on the same ideas over and over, without much continuity.To help remedy this, hackathon organizers can use Github to store code that is generated by all attendees.Organizers can encourage all developers to commit their code through-out the hackathon, and wrap up the event with a README file of their project as part of the presentation process.</p>
