        <span class="post-date">11 May 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-hypermedia.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I get hypermedia at a high level, but have no real experience designing or deploying a hypermedia API or client. For the longest time I just watched the hypermedia conversation from afar, but in the last year I have spent time learning about the different approaches, but I still have not gone as deep as I'd like. I'm looking to change this over the summer, and begin to add some hypermedia thinking to my own API design.</p>
<p>To get started I've targeted my curation API for the addition of a hypermedia layer, and I'm choosing <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a> as my hypermedia format. Siren spoke to me over some of the other approaches, but once I get my bearings I will look at tackling one or two more implementations. As I do with my other work, I'm just looking to share my thoughts in real-time, as I go along.</p>
<p>First, the process is really helping me tight down my API design. This is something I feel going with an API first design approach using Swagger has helped me, but adding the Siren format to the design of my API is taking this to a whole new level. I still have a longs ways to go in crafting the Siren responses for my curation API, but so far the process of defining the entities, actions, and links is really helping me think through the overall API design--leaving very few loose ends.</p>
<p>Second, the actions and links are also helping me really craft a more meaningful workflow around an API resource that I depend each day. This link curation API that I use in my daily, weekly, and monthly monitoring of the API space has an ever evolving workflow associated with it, but ultimately its been something I've kept in my head, or visualizing in the minmium viable (half-assed) clients I have built to help manage my world. This hypermedia learning process is forcing me to think it through, as if I'm telling the workflow to the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feels very much like storytelling on API Evangelist to me. You see I tell stories to work through my ideas, and craft a nevernding stream of evolving ideas, that help me better understand the world of APis, but also share it in a way that my readers can understand along the way. While applying hypermedia principles to my API design, I feel like I'm working through my API resources in much meaningful ways, and I'm not even approaching what some of the popular benefits of hypermedia are, yet.</p>
<p>I still don't what I am doing entirely, but sure enjoying the process.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 May 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/wurl-api-resources.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am spending a small amount of time each week, adding a new hypermedia layer to my link curation API. My goal is to better understand hypermedia, while also improving the designs of the APIs that I depend on for my own operations. During todays work, I was looking for a more extensive example of <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a> being used by an actual API provider, taking me beyond what Kevin Swiber (<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinswiber">@kevinswiber</a>) provides in his examples.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The example I found that has really helped me go from 0-60 when it comes to Siren (well maybe more like 0-15), was the <a href="http://developers.wurl.com/">TV and streaming video API platform Wurl</a>. The API has a pretty robust example of Siren being used in the wild, allowing me to reverse engineer the design patterns and apply in my own way--this is one way I learn things, through breaking down other people's work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://developers.wurl.com/pages/reference">Wurl has 11 entities defined</a>, demonstrating the really versatile power of Siren in defining the resources an API is serving up. They have some really nice workflows around each video episode, allowing them to be organized into series, bundles, and providing user management and search. For me it is a great introduction into what hypermedia is, and more specifically what Siren offers, in a working, real-world example.</p>
<p>I only have so much bandwidth to spend on this work, but after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/11/applying-a-little-hypermedia-is-helping-me-tighten-down-my-api-design-and-tell-a-better-api-story/">getting my feet wet adding a hypermedia layer link curation API using Siren</a>, and playing with the Wurl API, I've got a lof of new thoughts floating around my head around how I can improve my own API designs, and better present the large amount of information, visualizations, and other information available within my API curation lifecycle.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 May 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/17084937117_6045e3d299_z.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had a great conversation with Chris Taggart (<a href="https://twitter.com/countculture">@countculture</a>), the CEO of <a href="https://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a>, after his keynote at <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">APIDays Berlin / APIDays Europe 2015</a> last week, about how they get the data they need, to make the change they want to see in how we do business globally. Us technologists get excited about the potential around the ingestion of large data files published by companies and governments, and the scraping of data where we can. All of this is definitely be part of the open data lifecycle, but often times the whole open data thing, comes down to the human variable.</p>
<p>Almost every open data project I've embarked on, always has a portion of the process which involves me rolling up my sleeve, and cleaning up, and validating of data--there is just no way around it. Of course I do everything I can to automate the harvesting, mounting, processing, and cleaning up of data, but in the end most of the data I come across is just messy. This is just way things are, and while I'd love to not have to get my hands dirty, it is always a requirement to achieve my goal.</p>
<p>This is why it made me happy to talk through some of OpenCorporates processes with Chris, and learn that they have pretty similar approaches. They can definitely automate the extraction of files, and large of amounts of data, but when it comes to normalizing it, they often have to depend on putting the data into small batches, publishing to Google Spreadsheets, and rely on humans to do the detail work--yes, humans still have a purpose, when it comes to open data!</p>
<p>OpenCorporates tries to do as much of the heavy lifing as they can, but they still require on individuals, with as minimal amount of training as possible, to look at PDFs, HTML docs, and other files, and enter specific values into associated columns, and validate data that has been harvested--these Google Spreadsheets are then imported into the main system, that drives the site, and the OpenCorporates API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to point this our for two reasons, 1) opening up data is hard work, and there is only so much that we can rely on machines to do, and 2) this is a model that I feel we all can apply across other aspects of open data, not just opening up of corporate data. I'd like to see this applied to critical areas of city, county, and state government, and specifically the area of policing. I have ideas on how to federate this approach, something I'll share more when I have the time.</p>
<p>I just wanted to talk about the re-enforcement that I got from Chris, someone with a wealth of experience in the area, that compute ultimately will only gets us so far, and we need will legions of open data enthusiasts who can help make business and government a little more transparent. Are you with me? Let me know if you need an open data project, I have endless amounts.</p>

<p><em>This a guest post by Owen Rubel, fellow API architect, and "master of api automation, creator of #iostate, #apichaining". I am working with Owen to better understand API Chaining, and how it can be applied in several projects I am working on. Owen was kind enough to craft this post, to better help me understand is vision, as well as share with my audience. If you want to find out more about Owen, you can follow him on Twiiter <a href="https://twitter.com/OwenRubel">@OwenRubel</a>, and visit his <a href="https://github.com/orubel">Github repository</a> for the more technical side of his work.</em></p>
<p>In the early days of API development, the concept of the API was simple. It was designed as an interface to a separation of concern with two sets of functionality: standardized I/O and resource management. This was very convenient when the communication was localized in the application as the bound I/O state for an API call didn't have to be shared with external components. (see fig 1.)</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/guest-post/owen-rubel/image00.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></p>
<p>However, as API's were introduced for the web, the internalized I/O functionality associated with the API from the original pattern was gradually extended out with the architecture, and what was once associated with a separation of concern within the API soon needed to be shared across the architecture. This complicated how we built APIs for tooling such as the proxy, API gates, and message queues which now needed to share the I/O state with the application instance.</p>
<p>Original attempts at resolving this issue were to just move all I/O functionality out to the architecture. But this created additional overhead and throughput. For example (see fig 2), if handling security and I/O data checks in the proxy, when doing a forward/redirect in the application AFTER receiving a resource, one would have to send the request to the external architecture to handle security and I/O checks. This would cause the original thread to be abandoned, a new thread to be created, and additional processes to be I/O bound rather than CPU.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/guest-post/owen-rubel/image01.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></p>
<p><strong>Re-engineering the API Pattern</strong><br />The fundamental flaw in APIs today stems from the original design of the pattern:the original design binds I/O functionality and business logic (as seen in fig 1). This, in turn, binds I/O state to the application so it can't be shared with external architecture, and turns I/O into an architectural cross cutting concern.</p>
<p>To completely resolve this issue, we have to redesign the pattern (and how we develop for it) so the I/O state can be shared and functionality is no longer associated with the resolved endpoint. But how do we accomplish this? For starters, we need to determine where best to handle communications in a framework, some place that has a 'push/pull' mechanism and can effectively 'loopback' and talk to itself. This is commonly known as an 'Interceptor'.</p>
<p><strong>Abstracting The Communication Logic/Data</strong><br />Every single framework and codebase has something known as an 'Interceptor'. Rails calls them filters, Node.js calls it loopback, and in Grails and Spring we have the HandlerInterceptor. An Interceptor is a common pattern that does precisely what it says: it intercepts the request prior to calling the endpoint and then intercepts the response prior to returning to the client. &nbsp;Why do we care about this?</p>
<p>An Interceptor allows us to put all the pre/post logic associated with the request/response in a common place, therefore creating a communication layer in a framework. And in the case of a web framework, it allows us to create a single threaded loopback. This also gives us the ability to automate communication logic that we have embedded in the 'business logic' such as batching, I/O role checking, and I/O data checking, in turn greatly reducing code.</p>
<p>IO State can be thought of as an architectural schema for APIs. It is the data that defines the current state of the I/O flow stored in a shareable object, the request/response data, roles used for access, version number for matching, and the URI, etc. It is all data separated from functionality that would be useful for resolving, accessing and returning a resource from a given endpoint so it can be used across all architectural components.</p>
<p>Below is an example of I/O State stored for an API call:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/ae1c609f6abd0326bbf0.js"></script>
<p>The above I/O State tells all pieces of the architecture that when someone calls this domain with the endpoint 'test/show' and version '1', check the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>METHOD</strong> - request method should be GET</li>
<li><strong>ROLES</strong> - roles that can access this api method; permitAll being 'open access'</li>
<li><strong>BATCH</strong> - roles permitted to call this api method as a batch job</li>
<li><strong>REQUEST</strong> - input data to be sent per respective role; above we expect 'permitAll' to send 'id'</li>
<li><strong>RESPONSE</strong> - output data to be returned per respective role; in the case of role 'USER' we expect [id] but in the case of role 'ADMIN' we expect [id,testdata]</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives us the ability to have one file for the I/O rules separate from the functionality that can be shared by the API Gateway, proxy, api instances, MQ, and others. And by separating the communication logic from business logic, we can do our method checking, data checking &nbsp;and security checks at the 'pre-Interceptor' and formatting at the 'post-Interceptor'. This reduces Controller code which would look like the following:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/5241e78850921dd5e670.js"></script>
<p>To something more like this:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/f6533defb4a366f30d93.js"></script>
<p>We can now return the same object regardless of ROLE and use IO state to filter data upon exit at the Interceptor...instead of at the controller. This gives us greater controller to check ROLES and input/output at the proxy or the message queue or at any other level of tooling we should need. And because we are returning the same object, we can cache the object, enabling additional speed improvements.</p>
<p>By storing I/O state in a common object and calling it up front, we are able to reject early, reduce processing, reduce the amount of code needed, share IO state, remain more CPU bound and remain nearly 100% stateless.</p>
<p>To be able to share the I/O effectively with the architecture, we need an object that can be loadable by all architectural tooling through a common cache which would hold the I/O state associated with each and every api call. This is what I call the 'apiObject'.</p>
<p><strong>API Chaining : Multiple Requests in a Single Thread</strong><br />One of the greatest benefits of an Interceptor in conjunction with an I/O state is the ability to do API chaining.</p>
<p>API Chaining is an I/O monad in which multiple API calls can be passed using a single request. A monad works with each call passing the result to the next call in the chain. API chaining builds on this by using the cached I/O state to allow the client to read relationships, build relatable APIs, and send the state for each URI in the chain in one call.</p>
<p>When the API chain is sent, each call is processed and checked, and required data for the call in the chain is sent back through the postInterceptor to the preInterceptor until the end of the chain is reached.</p>
<p>As a request can only have one declared method, the API chain is composed entirely of GET API Calls with ONE unsafe method call (PUT, POST, DELETE). This unsafe method is considered the 'master' method telling it either where to start or where to stop based on what type of chain is declared. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>'blank chain' </strong>- GET &gt; GET &gt; GET &gt; GET</li>
<li><strong>'prechain'</strong> - &nbsp;POST &gt; GET &gt; GET</li>
<li><strong>'postchain' </strong>- GET &gt; GET &gt; GET &gt; PUT</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of people ask, 'why can't we have the method called in the middle?' This is because it would enable a double call to methods or two unsafe methods in one request. Therefore, we have the unsafe method as the toggle for the start/end of the chain.</p>
<p>A typical chain call looks something like this:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/ef34fa9c44e9b8613d4c.js"></script>
<p>and is called like this:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/ec21bd031c7847485f29.js"></script>
<p>The API chain is broken out into several pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>data</strong> - data is the first set of fields sent</li>
<li><strong>chain</strong> - chain is the api chain object; all data related to the chain is found here</li>
<li><strong>key</strong> - the 'primer' key from first returned set for the next; since you often encode keys in the url or in the dataset, this is a separate place to declare the 'primer' key for the chain</li>
<li><strong>combine</strong> - this is a toggle telling us whether to concatenate results from each call; useful in 'blank chains'</li>
<li><strong>type</strong> - type of chain (i.e., blankchain, prechain, postchain)</li>
<li><strong>order</strong> - the order in which the url's are called; uri's are given as key:val with the 'val' being values sent to next link in chain.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also notice the final value in the chain of 'return'. This tells the chain to stop and return, and can be used at any time in the chain for chain branching. Chain branching is a way to stop your chain and branch another chain from it.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion<br /></strong>The advantages of I/O State, API I/O abstraction, and API chaining can be tremendous, turning every API call into a microservice, as well as reducing your process, your code, and your time to deploy. For example, the use of API chaining in a telecommunications setting on can allow mobile calls to increase their speed by at least 50-75%. Not only does API chaining fix existing issues with the API pattern, but you will also need less tooling, less code, and experience faster delivery and deployment.</p>

<p>I was taking a look at a new healthcare API recently, adding it to my stack, for deeper review at a later date. Whenever I add a company to my monitoring and review system, I go through the site to make sure they have some of the characteristics of a modern API. I am not interested in many of the APIs that I come across that are older web services, or just poorly done APIs. I want to make sure APIs have self-service registration, some web API characteristics, code libraries, support, and a minimum viable set of building blocks.</p>
<p><a href="https://validic.com/">The API I was looking at is&nbsp;Validic, which bills itself as a "Digital Health Platform"</a>. I'm coming across a number of new API driven, healthcare platforms, like Validic lately. As I was adding it to my database I noticed the legal section in the footer, which had five elements:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Security Policy</li>
<li>Service Level Agreement (SLA)</li>
<li>Support Policy</li>
<li>Privacy Policy</li>
<li>Terms &amp; Conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>Three of the five elements, I have as building blocks that I recommend for platforms. I'm taking note of two of the two that I do not have recorded, a data security policy, and support policy. While I think the stakes are a little bitter higher in healthcare, an industry that would require this added level of protection for the platform, developers, and users, I think these building blocks could be something I may include for all API providers.</p>
<p>I think having a support policy sets the bar, for how a platform will support its developers. I also find the data security policy very intriguing, setting the bar for how a platform will secure users data on the platform--something every online platform should step up and do, no matter what industry you are in. As I review the platform more, I will break down these potential new building blocks, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">and add them to my master list</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a review of the <a href="https://www.callfire.com/">communication API platform CallFire</a>, crafting a snapshot of platform operations, from an external viewpoint, providing the CallFire platform team with a fresh take on their API from the outside-in. The criteria applied in this review is gathered from looking at the API operations across thousands of API providers, and aggregating best practices, into a single, distilled review process.</p>
<p>This review has been commissioned by CallFire, but as anyone who's paid me for a review knows, money doesn't equal a favorable review&mdash;I tell it like I see it. My objective is to help CallFire see their platform through a different sense, as developers might see their platform. It can be hard to see the forest for the trees, and I find the API review is a great way to help API providers see the bigger picture.</p>
<p>I prefer to share my API reviews in a narrative format, walking through each of the important aspect of API management, telling the story of what I see, and what I don't see. Here is the story of what I found while reviewing the communication API platform for CallFire.</p>
<p><strong>Overview<br /></strong>CallFire makes for an easier review than some API operations, because the API is the product. As soon as you land on the homepage of the website, you begin your API journey as a potential API consumer. The first thing you read is "Over 2 Billion Messages Delivered&rdquo;, so you immediately understand what CallFire does, and the next thing that grabs your eye is &ldquo;Signup For Free&rdquo;&mdash;way to not miss a beat, CallFire.</p>
<p>Next you see five simple icons, with simple text, breaking what CallFire does down: Text Messaging, Call Tracking, Video Broadcast, Cloud Call Center, IVR. Within the first five seconds you fully understand what is being offered, and given the opportunity to sign up. If that is not enough, you are also told the reasons why: Engage Your Customers, Save Valuable Time, Increase Revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.callfire.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/callfire/callfire-home-page.png" alt="CallFire Messaging" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>After you look at thousands of APIs, nothing is more frustrating than to have to figure out what an API does. CallFire gives me what I need, in five seconds or less, without clicking or scrolling. This is the way all APIs should be, if not the homepage of website, then the landing page of the API developer portal. The main page of the CallFire website is well designed, and organized in a simple, and robust way, giving you one-click access to everything you need to get going with the platform--no other feedback required.</p>
<p><strong>Endpoints</strong><br />This is the part of the review I dive into the actual design of the API, and provide some feedback on the technical endpoints of the APIs themselves. CallFire is unique because it has a REST and a SOAP version of the API available, which I think is important in today's business climate, where APIs are targeting open developers, as well as those within the enterprise.</p>
<p>The CallFire API is very robust, with wide range of endpoints / methods for the most basic text and call features, all the way up to campaign, subscription, and contact management. You can tell the system is well thought out, providing a full suite of communication resources for all types of developers.</p>
<p>On you dig into the REST API you begin to see quite a bit of SOAP residue, and while the API has a well thought out list of endpoints, many elements of the parameters, requests, and responses feel SOAPy, including the XML responses. There is also a lack of consistent response codes, and defined data model, giving the REST API an unfinished, empty bottom feeling.</p>
<p>Overall I give the API a solid B in that it is a very robust stack, but I'd say it needs some hard use, and integrations before some of the rough edges are hammered off, parameters become more intuitive, and request and response structures normalize. Much of this just comes with usage, and requires getting closer to real world use cases, end users, before it becomes more of an experience based design vs. the resource based design it currently is.</p>
<p>I could easily go through the entire Swagger definition for CallFire and make recommendations on naming conventions, and help craft the resource definitions for the underlying data models, but this is best worked out with the community, iterating, and communicating with developers, and learning more about truly what they need. Think of it as kiln firing of the API, through developer execution, and robust platform feedback loops.</p>
<p><strong>On-Boarding</strong><br />On-boarding with the CallFire API was frictionless. I went one click from home page, authenticated with my Google Account, and immediately I was dropped into my account dashboard, with a helpful intro screen showing me where things are. I easily found the area in my account to add an application, and get my API keys, then stumbled into the overview of how to activate your account as well&mdash;account management was intuitive.</p>
<p>The intuitive and informative CallFire home page made the API easy to find, and with frictionless account signup, and a standard API app management, I was ready to make my first call on the API within 10 minutes. The only thing I would consider adding as part of the process, is an option for signup and login using my Github credentials, in addition to Facebook, and Google.</p>
<p>On-boarding with an API is often the most frustrating part of API integration, and it wasn't something I worried about at all with CallFire. The process was intuitive, smooth, and didn't leave me trying to understand what the API does, and how I am supposed to make it work. Solid A on the on-boarding process for the CallFire API.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.callfire.com/api-documentation/rest/version/1.1"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/callfire/callfire-api-documentation.png" alt="CallFire Messaging" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong><br />Documentation is one of the most critical aspects of API integration, making or breaking many integration efforts by developers. CallFire has double duty, in that it needs to provide documentation for the REST and SOAP version. Somethig CallFire manages to deliver with no problem, providing clean, easy to follow documentation for both APIs they offer.</p>
<p>The SOAP API document provides a simple breakdown of operations and methods, with easy to follow descriptions for everything. Ultimately the SDKs do most of the heavy lifting here, but the SOAP docs provide a nice overview of the CallFire platform.</p>
<p>The REST API for CallFire is defined using the machine readable API definition format Swagger, and uses Swagger UI to generate documentation, making learning about the API more interactive. Swagger provides a machine readable overview of the CallFire API, and is an approach to delivering API documentation that keeps pace with modern approaches.</p>
<p>I do not have much feedback for the documentation side of CallFire, I'd like to see more information about the underlying data model described in the Swagger definition, as well more detail about the response codes, but I give the platform documentation a solid B for being simple, clean, and complete--the API just needs some hardening, and the documentation will improve.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong><br />On-boarding with the CallFire API is frictionless, and adding an app, and finding your API keys are intuitive enough. The platform also provides a nice overview on how to enable the API on your CallFire account, but ultimately the topic of authentication is neglected.</p>
<p>Authentication for SOAP interactions, and REST for that matter, are abstracted away by each of the SDKs. However one of the elements of RESTful APIs is that authentication should be clearly defined as part of the documentation. I suggest adding a page, or section on an existing page that is dedicated authentication, explaining the BasicAuth used to secure the CallFire API. For any experienced API consumer it isn't difficult navigate, but the app manager with login and password, has appearance that it may be app key via a header or parameter, not BasicAuth--a dedicated authentication overview page would help clear up.</p>
<p>As part of authentication review I do not usually advocate for a specific authentication approach, when the choices are BasicAuth, or using the app id and keys in the header or parameters. The best option is to pick one, be consistent, and explain it clearly, on a page that stands out. Overall the authentication for CallFire is intuitive, it just needs a little bit of information to makes things 100% clear when you first find yourself making that first API call.</p>
<p><em><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Since I wrote this review, and the time of publishing, <a href="https://answers.callfire.com/hc/en-us/articles/205407787-Authentication">CallFire has updated their portal to include a well formed authentication overview for the platform</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Code</strong><br />After documentation, code samples, libraries, and SDKs are key to a painless API integration. For the CallFire API, there are only two SDKs available currently, for the PHP, and .NET platforms. It is common that platforms who are just getting going, only have a handful of SDKs in specific language, and is forgivable, but is also a sign of platform immaturity (aka lots of work still to be done).</p>
<p>Another aspect of SDK design for CallFire, that I'd like to bring up, is the cohabitation of REST and SOAP in a single SDK. I'm not sure this type of cross pollination is ideal for all integrations. Maybe it is just my architectural style, but I like seeing each SDK be as smallest possible footprint as possible, and meet the needs of developers without any extraneous bloat.</p>
<p>CallFire needs to have Python, Ruby, Java, Node.Js, Go, and JavaScript language SDKs to be able to serve as wide as possible audience as we possibly can. To help achieve this I recommend soliciting the help of platform users, or even paying a 3rd party developer to build SDKs, if needed.</p>
<p>Moving beyond SDKs, into what I call Platform Development Kits (PDK), CallFire does well in providing two distinct platform plugins for WordPress and Drupal. I recommend bringing these PDKs to the surface, and showcase them in a full SDK and PDK showcase page&mdash;showing what is possible. &nbsp;Maybe even considering the next step, of what is the 3rd PDK that could be developed? SalesForce? Heroku?</p>
<p>The usage of Github by CallFire is another important signal, showing the platform is progressive, and something that developers can depend on. I recommend further bringing Github into the site, linking to accounts, providing direct links to SDK and PDK repositories from an official page, and add Github authentication for developers to be able to create and manage their accounts. Github isn't just about code, it is a potentially important social layer to the CallFire API ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile</strong><br />There really is no evidence of any mobile SDKs, or information for mobile developers available on the CallFire platform. It is common to find entire sections dedicated to mobile developers, or at least links to mobile platform specific code libraries. I recommend establishing a mobile focused section of the platform, and invest the resources necessary to help developers build iOS, Android, and Windows mobile applications using CallFire.</p>
<p><strong>Support</strong><br />CallFire is doing well on the support front, providing building blocks for both direct, and self-service support. I like to see a mix of support services that developers can find on their own, getting the help they need 24/7, but they also need to be able to get direct support when they get stuck.</p>
<p>When it comes to direct support, CallFire is rocking it, with a support email, live chat, phone number, contact form, and ticketing system tied to your account messaging area. The only additional things I could recommend CallFire offering is paid support plans, allowing developers to pay for one-on-one support via chat, online hangout, or other means.</p>
<p>With self-service support, there is the CallFire FAQ, which I'd call more a knowledgeable than a simple FAQ, providing a wealth of knowledge about the platform. The only common element I see missing is more of a community element with a forum, or usage of Stack Overflow to engage with the wider developer community. &nbsp;The current FAQ is very robust, and with the integrated ticketing system, the potential is great, but it is all missing that community piece.</p>
<p>Overall, CallFire support is as robust as you'd expect from any API platform. When you combine with the social media presence the platform has, that I'll cover as part of the communication strategy, the platform has all of its bases covered. A+ on support effort.</p>
<p><strong>Communications</strong><br />When it comes to my review criteria for communications, other than a newsletter, CallFire nailed everyone of them. The platform has all of the expected social media platforms, has an active blog with RSS feed, and is very accessible with email, phone, and chat. All of this sends the right signals to the community, and potential API consumers, that someone is home. I have nothing to contribute when it comes to communications, as long as all channels are kept active, CallFire is doing everything it can in my mind.</p>
<p><strong>Change Practices</strong><br />As platform providers, we are asking developers to depend on us, and integrate our resources into their applications, and businesses. That is asking a lot, and we need to provide as much information as possible about what the future hold, to hlep build trust with developers. There a handful of proven ways for doing this, established by leading API platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roadmap</strong> - API roadmaps are usually a simple, bulleted list, derived from the APIs own internal roadmap, showing what the future holds for the platform. Transparency around an APIs roadmap is a tough balance, since you don't want to give away too much, alerting your competitors, but your developer ecosystem needs to know what is next.</li>
<li><strong>Status Dashboard -</strong> Status dashboards are a common way for API platforms to communicate the availability of an API, but also show the track record of a platform, helping developers understand the track record for an API they are to integrate with. There are several simple services, that help API providers do this, without investment in new tools and systems.</li>
<li><strong>Change Log - </strong>Knowing the past is a big part of understanding where things are in store for the future. A change log should work in sync with the API roadmap building block, but provide much more detailed information about changes that have occurred with an API. Developers will not always pay attention to announced updates, but can use a change log as a guide for deciding what changes they need to make in their applications and how they will use an API.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Sharing the change history of a platform, a roadmap to the future, and a status of API operations at the moment go a long way in help build trust with developers. Transparency in the development of any platform, is essential in helping developers feel comfortable that a platform will be around to support their needs, and is worthy of their time.</p>

<p><strong>Business Model</strong><br />When reviewing APIs, the overall business model is usually one of the most incomplete aspects of operations, in my experience. This is ok, as many platforms are still figuring this out, however this is not the case with CallFire. The business model for the platform isn't just well defined, it provides me with an example to use when helping other API providers visualize what is possible.</p>
<p>The pricing page for CallFire is clean, well thought out, and provides sensibles tiers of operation, with clear units of measurement, letting me know what I get for each level. I can easily upgrade the access tier directly from my account settings, and I can get volume pricing if needed. This is how APIs should work, allowing me to easily calculate what I'll need, and figure out which tier I will be operating within, complete with a self-service option for scaling as I need, paying for what I use, as I go.</p>
<p>The billing management and credit system for CallFire is superior to most of even the most thought out API billing and pricing models. It is clean, well thought out, and makes sense from a user perspective&mdash;which is the most important aspect. I'll be using CallFire credit system as a reference when I talk about how the platforms should build tooling that supports the underlying API business model.</p>
<p>I can't articulate enough, how well done the business model, pricing, supporting billing and the other business elements of the CallFire API.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong><br />When it comes to available support resources, it is another area CallFire does very well. The platform has heavily invested in case studies, videos, webinars, and a tour of the platform. They even have a communications and marketing glossary developers can use to get up to speed. CallFire does a good job of providing valuable resources to get developers quickly understand all aspects of platform operations..</p>
<p>A couple of areas I could provide suggestions for improvement, in is when it comes to more industry level white papers, and when the evangelism side of things kicks in maybe consider posting slide decks from events CallFire presents at, as well as a calendar of interesting events. These things will happen I'm sure once an API evangelism strategy is kicked into full gear, but for now just keep doing more of the same--providing lots of rich resources for devs.</p>
<p><strong>Research &amp; Development</strong><br />I'd file R&amp;D in the same category as mobile, non-existent. API ecosystem are essentially external R&amp;D labels for companies, and general operations are about exploring ideas of what can be build with an API, but it helps to have some element available to stimulate overall R&amp;D via the platform.</p>
<p>Some of these elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Idea Showcase - A place the community can share ideas of what could be built with the CallFire platform.</li>
<li>Labs Environment - A workbench showing what CallFire is working on when it comes to their own integration.</li>
<li>Opportunities - Available opportunities to build things like SDKs, PDKs, or specific projects.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>These are just three things that help stimulate the innovation around an API. Sometimes developers just need something to spark the imagination, or possibly see an existing labs project to help them see something in their own work. These rich R&amp;D environments can provide a great opportunity to help meet the needs of CallFire, and its partners.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Department</strong><br />CallFire has the requisite Terms of Service (TOS), and privacy policy. I'm not a lawyer, so i'm not going to parse all of the details of each. There was nothing that raised my TOS alarms too significantly, the TOS were pretty standard, and the privacy policy didn't raise any huge privacy concerns as well I wouldn't have any problems integrating my own platform and business into CallFire.</p>
<p>A couple of items I'd recommend also considering, based upon what I seen on other platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code License - </strong>The PHP SDK has an MIT license, but the .NET didn't have anything. A centralized code licensing page could help as well.</li>
<li><strong>API License -</strong> A license for the API itself, applied to the REST API interface that is defined by Swagger, using API Commons format.</li>
<li><strong>Service Level Agreement (SLA) - </strong>Provide a service level agreement for API consumers to take advantage of, and understand service level commitments.</li>
<li><strong>Branding -</strong> There are no branding or style guidelines with support resources like logos, etc&mdash;missed opportunity for spreading word, and steering developers in the right direction.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Just a couple of things to think about. All of these would go a long way in building trust with developers, and the branding thing is a huge missed opportunity in my opinion. When you bundle these with the TOS, privacy, and compliance information already provided by the platform, it would round off the legal department of the CallFire API nicely.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable</strong><br />Embeddable tooling is another area that is non-existent for the CallFire API. There are no embeddable tools like widgets, buttons, etc that allow the average end-user, and developer to put the API to use in web pages, and applications. I'm not sure what an embeddable suite of tools would look like for CallFire, that would need to be a separate brainstorming process.</p>
<p>When it comes to communication platforms, especially ones involving media, and deep social interactions, embeddable tools are a proven way to grow platform, expand the network effect, and potentially bring in new developers. I recommend including an embeddable section to the site, with a handful of embeddable tooling to compliment the SDK and PDK resources already available.</p>
<p><strong>Environment</strong><br />One area I consider when looking through API operations, is the environment itself. By default many APIs are live, ready for production use, but increasingly platforms are employing alternate environments for development, QA, and potentially variant product environment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sandbox</strong> - With the sensitive information available via many APIs, providing developers a sandbox environment to develop and test their code might be wise idea. Sandboxes environments will increase the overall cost of an API deployment, but can reduce headaches for developers and can significantly reduce support overhead. Consider the value of a sandbox when planning an API.</li>
<li><strong>Production</strong> - When planning an API, consider if all deployments need to have access to live data in real-time or there is the need to require developers to request for separate production access for their API applications. In line with the sandbox building block, a separate API production environment can make for a much healthier API ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Simulator</strong> - Providing an environment where developers can find existing profiles, templates or other collections of data, as well as sequence for simulating a particular experience via an API platform. While this is emerging as critical building block for Internet of Thing APIs, it is something other API providers have been doing to help onboard new users.</li>
<li><strong>Templates</strong> - Predefined templates of operation, when a new environment is setup, either sandbox, production, or simulator, it can be pre-populated with data, and other configuration, making it more useful to developers. These templates can be used throughout the API lifecycle from development, QA, all the way to simulation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>This approach to delivering an environment for the CallFire API is not essential, but I could see it providing some interesting scenarios for communication campaigns, and the deployment of messaging infrastructure in a containerized, Internet of Things rich environment. Deployment CallFire communication infrastructure should be as flexible as possible to support the next generation of Internet enabled communication, both in the cloud and on-premise.</p>
<p><strong>Developers</strong><br />An often overlooked aspect of API operations is the tools provided to API consumers. CallFire is in a fortunate position as the API is core to their product, and the API integration is an extension of a primary CallFire user account. The account area for CallFire is well done, clean, and gives users, and those who choose to be API consumers, quite a bit of control over their communication infrastructure.</p>
<p>CallFire nailed almost every API account area I like to see in any API platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account Dashboard - </strong>The dashboard for CallFire account is well done, and information.</li>
<li><strong>Account Settings - </strong>CallFire provides a high level of control over account settings.</li>
<li><strong>Reset Password -</strong> Resetting password is important, and I like to highlight separately.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - The app management for CallFire is on par with rest of industry.</li>
<li><strong>Service Tiers -</strong> The ability to change service tier, and scale is pretty significant.</li>
<li><strong>Messaging</strong> - An import part of the communication and support strategy of platform.</li>
<li><strong>Billing</strong> &nbsp;- Essential to the economy portion of platform operations, well executed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>There are a couple of areas I'd like to see, to round off developer account operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Github Authentication -</strong> It would fit nicely with Facebook, and Google Auth--I prefer authenticating for APIs with my Github.</li>
<li><strong>Delete Account - </strong>Maybe it is in there, but I couldn't find it. The ability to delete an account is important in my book.</li>
<li><strong>Usage Logs &amp; Analytics -</strong> I'd like to see application specific analytics like on the dashboard, showing usage per app.</li>
<li><strong>Account API -</strong> Allow API access to all account operations, allowing access to account settings, usage limits, billing, messaging and other areas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>The CallFire account management for users and developers is much more robust than I see in many of the APIs I review. Like I said before the monetization portion is something to be showcased, and all the most important aspects of account management for API operations are present. It wouldn't take much to round off with a couple more features, some more analytics, and an account management API would really take things to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong><br />I always enjoy when I come find consistent design, and function across API operations. This is what I found with CallFire. The API isn't an afterthought like other platforms, it is their product, and the site design, messaging, and content are consistent across the platform.</p>
<p>The API design is consistent, and the supporting documentation is as well. The only thing I'd add is design patterns across the SOAP and REST API should be less consistent, and stay true to their own design constraints. The details of the REST could be tightened, to be more consistent in how parameters are formed, and response formats, and error code are commonly presented.</p>
<p>Usually when reviewing APIs, I look for fractures between API operations, like clunky UI between website sections, or incomplete documentation, often created by disparate teams. This doesn't exist with CallFire, and while there are many details that could be cleaned up, the consistency is all there.</p>
<p><strong>Openness</strong><br />This is a term thrown around a lot in the space, and very seldom do sites live up to it. There are many things that contribute to whether or not an API is truly open. CallFire delivers on all of the important areas, making open a word I'd apply to CallFire.</p>
<p>First on-boarding for the platform frictionless, and everything is self-service, even scaling your account when you need more credits. You have control over your account, and the terms of service and privacy policy are liberal. These are all hallmarks of an open API. Add the ability to delete my account, I'm 100% on board.</p>
<p>One of the things I think heavily contribute to the openness of the CallFire platform is the business model. The monetization strategy is well formed, with pricing and service tiers well defined. You know what things cost, and how to get what you need. This type of approach eliminates the need for other extraneous rate list, or restrictions&mdash;this type of balance is important to truly achieving openness.</p>
<p>After this review I'd call CallFire an open API, but only time will tell, if the platform is also stable, support channels are truly supportive, and other aspects of open that only CallFire can deliver on. For right now I consider them open for business, and open for developers, but ultimately whether or not CallFire is willing to share this review, will put the exclamation on the platform openness definition, won't it! ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Evangelism</strong><br />The usual footprint you'd see when an API platform has an active evangelism program doesn't exist for CallFire, but that is part of the motivation of this review. We are looking to take a snapshot of where &nbsp;the platform is at, in hopes of providing much needed input for the roadmap, as well as establish a version 1.0 evangelism strategy--we will revisit the evangelism portion of this review in a couple months.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />In short, the CallFire passes my review. There are several key areas like mobile, and roadmap communication, that are missing from the platform entirely, but then there are other areas CallFire nails almost every one of my review criteria. The API is robust, the documentation is complete, and they provide all the essential support building blocks.</p>
<p>One of the things that really stand out for me is the CallFire business model, something that I think really cuts through the BS of many APIs I look at. CallFire has a clear business model, and the tools to manage your API usage. There is no grey area with the business of model for CallFire, which is something I just don't see a lot of.</p>
<p>I'd say my biggest concern with the platform is the lack of diverse code resources. I can't tell if they are just getting going, or maybe the lack of developer skills is slowing the diversity of available coding resources--I am just not sure. My guess is their is a lack of diverse developer skills on staff, which explains the lack of mobile SDKs, and the SOAP residue on the REST API. My advice is to invest in the developer resources necessary to load the platform up with a wide variety of coding resources that developers can put to work in their projects.</p>
<p>Beyond the code resources, it is really just a bunch smaller items that would bring the platform into better form. CallFire definitely reflects everything I'm looking for in an API platform, and is something I've included in the top APIs I track on as part of my API Stack. Additionally, I've gathered a couple of other stories while doing this review, including the overall monetization strategy, the notification system under account settings, and their usage of Swagger&mdash;which is always another good sign of a healthy platform, and a positive review.</p>
<p>Lots going on with the <a href="https://www.callfire.com/">CallFire platform</a>, I recommend taking a look at what they are up to.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/t-shirts/KL_InApiWeTrust-1000.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In 2010 I started API Evangelist, as part of my effort to better understand the world of APIs. I was looking to not just the technology of how it was done, I saw there were plenty of people doing this. I wanted to better understand the business of APIs, and how popular APIs were finding success with their business models, developer outreach, and other aspects of API operations--going well beyond just the technology.</p>
<p>API Evangelist started simply as a blog. I was not a big fan of WordPress, as I knew it can be quite a security target, and as a platform, for a programmer like me, can be more difficult to get even the simple things done. With this in mind I started the first API Evangelist API, by following the same advice that I would be giving to my potential audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/blog/</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Quickly I needed some additional APIs, to keep track of some of the players I saw emerging across the landscape. In 2010, the most important piece of the puzzle, when it came to the business of APIs (after the APIs themselves) was the growing number of API service providers, who were popping up to deliver much needed services to API providers. To support my work I added a couple more API endpoints.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/apis/</strong></p>
<p>Tracking on APIs wasn't that critical, as it was something <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> already did, but I still preferred to track on some addition details for my own needs. When it came to deploying my own APIs, I kept the as simple as possible, using the backend that I knew best -- the LAMP stack. I was already running several websites on Amazon Web Services, so I chose to deploy my servers and database using Amazon, using a pretty proven formula for delivering a backend stack.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>LAMP Stack - MySQL (RDS) + PHP / Linux (EC2)</strong></p>
<p>PHP may not be the choice of API champions, but I was fluent in it, and I new that when the time came, and I open sourced the back-end for API Evangelist, that if everything was straight up LAMP stack, I would reach the widest possible audience. Now, with my base API infrastructure in place, I began designing, and deploying other APIs I needed to track on the world of APIs. I needed to track on some of the open source tools I was finding so I added a new endpoint.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/tools/</strong></p>
<p>After tooling, links were quickly becoming a big challenge for me. I needed a way to track on links to not just stories, but also events, white papers, presentations, and other resources that I was referencing in my research. I needed another API that I could use to store links from across the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/links/</strong></p>
<p>Once my links API was in place, I also began using it for a number of other functions, showing me that I quickly needed more functionality beyond simply storing a title, description, and URL. As I was monitoring the space, I  saw that I would needed a way to curate links to important stories across the fast growing space each week--resulting in me adding a new layer to my links API.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/links/curation/</strong></p>
<p>Beyond tracking on important links, and curating the news each week, I started to see that many of the links I placed in my blog posts were disappearing. The API space moves really fast, and many of the API companies that were being acquired or shutting down, were simply disappearing. I didn't like my readers stumbling across dead links, so I added another layer to my links APIs to help, which I called.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/links/linkrot/</strong></p>
<p>Part of the linkrot API operations, was taking a screenshot of each website referenced, so when it disappeared, I could easily replace it with a popup screenshot of what used to be there. To support this I was using a number of 3rd party screenshot APIs, which after using three separate ones, each shutting down, I eventually created my own screen capture API.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/links/screenshots/</strong></p>
<p>Beyond links, I was hitting on similar problems with my service provider API. Some of the companies I tracked on were not APIs or API service providers, I needed a way to track on other types of companies. At the same moment I realized I also needed a way to track the individuals who were also doing interesting things in the space, as well as the companies they worked at, resulting in the creation of two new APIs:</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/people/</strong><br /><strong> api.apievangelist.com/companies/</strong></p>
<p>Similar to links, I created a new API that allowed me to centrally manage all the images I used. I store all my images on Amazon S3, but I needed a way to track not the URL, but also a plain english title, description, tags, and other metadata about images. I added another new API.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/images/</strong></p>
<p>Then, similar to my link system, I began having more advanced needs for images, which required numerous endpoints to be added, allowing me to better manage the visual side of operations for API Evangelist. Images are critical to my storytelling, so I hand crafted exactly the APIs resources I needed to get the job done.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/images/resize/</strong><br /><strong> api.apievangelist.com/images/crop/</strong><br /><strong> api.apievangelist.com/images/compress/</strong></p>
<p>There are too many APIs to list as part of this story. Ultimately over the last five years, I've added an ever increasing number of utility APIs that help me manage data and content across the API Evangelist network. Most of these APIs were custom developed, but some simply provided a facade for other public APIs, or open source software I had installed on the server.</p>

<p>I was accumulating a pretty interesting stack of information, which I was using to power my own network, but I was the API Evangelist, without any public APIs. I wanted to open up my APIs to the public, and what better way to do it than to evaluating the API management providers I had been writing about, a process which resulted with me choosing 3Scale API Infrastructure. 3Scale had the features I needed like user management, analytics, and valuable service composition tooling, allowing me to craft different levels of access to my APIs for public usage, access by my partners, and of course for my own internal usage.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/3scale/API-Management+-3scale-API-Management-Solution.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></p>
<p>Using 3Scale I dropped an include file into my existing API stack, and with just a few lines of code I secured my APIs, and metered who had access, requiring registration for public or partner levels of access. To support this I launched a simple portal for the APIs I was making public. I didn't release all of my APIs, only the ones I felt the public would be interested in.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/3scale/API-Evangelist-Core-APIs.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></p>
<p>I kept on working on my infrastructure, adding an increasing number of endpoints, building on existing APIs, evolving my APIs to help me better monitor the API space, organize information, and craft the stories that I publish each week to the API evangelist network. Eventually I had hundreds of endpoints, some of them well planned, but many of them just thrown up to support some need I had at the moment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/3scale/building-block-apis.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></p>
<p>The API Evangelist API stack was growing more unwieldy by the day, and even though I am the sole developer, sometimes I'd lose track of what I had. I also struggled with consistency, I am not always the most regular guy when it comes to naming conventions, use of query parameters, headers, and other common illnesses you see in API design across the space. Another thing that was getting out of control, was my backend database.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/3scale/apievangelist-backend-database.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></p>
<p>It was my database. I could do whatever I wanted. I just added tables, columns, and new databases as I saw fit--again, all without much consistency. I was growing a pretty large legacy code base, which was API driven, but API does not always equal better. You can just as easily build a monster with APIs, as you can with historical approaches to API design. Additionally, my architecture ran on a single Amazon RDS database instance, with a single Amazon EC2 Linux instance, serving up all the APIs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-broken-link.png" alt="" width="25%" align="center" /></p>
<p>If one API failed, all APIs failed. If I was running a large job against a single API, say creating screenshots, compressing images, or other CPU intensive processes, my other APIs suffered. Also if I rebooted the server, everything went dark. Which as a independent operator, is always very tempting.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-server-reboot.png" alt="" width="25%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>I loved my evolving API stack, it did what I needed, but was increasingly looking like many of the legacy systems I had managed in the past, only this time it was all accessible through a single API stack. If my APIs did what I needed, this wasn't a problem, but in my back of my head I knew eventually it would catch up with me. For now I ignored it, and moved forward comfortably numb (Pink Floyd).</p>
<p>Along the way I also discovered new tools for helping me manage my APIs, specifically my API documentation, by using Swagger. If I crafted a machine readable JSON definition for my APIs using Swagger, I could automatically generate interactive documentation for my APIs, that was always up to date.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-design.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>Quickly I found Swagger to be much more than just a machine readable API definition format, that just can be used to generate interactive documentation, or the generation of client side code libraries. While it still fully isn't realized, I saw that if I took an API design first approach, using Swagger, that it slowly was becoming a central truth throughout my API life cycle. This was just the beginning of a new world of API design, deployment, and management for me.</p>
<p>Along the way in 2014, Steve Willmott, the CEO of 3Scale and I developed a machine readable API discover format, which we called APIs.json. This new JSON format, was intended to provide a machine readable index of all APIs that exist within a single website domain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-json/apis-json.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></a></strong></p>
<p>Using APIs.json I could provide essential meta data about the domain an API operates in, as well as for each API endpoint available, like name, description, tags, and critical links to aspects of operations like the portal landing page, API documentation, code libraries, pricing, or terms of service. For each API I hand crafted an APIs.json, allowing me to publish a machine readable index of APIs that exist within my domain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-json/apis-json-apis-with-swagger.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>APIs.json immediately provided me with a very valuable index of my own APIs. Then I got thinking, what if I also indexed the public APIs that I depended on as well? So, I put around 50 public APIs to use, and nowhere did I have a comprehensive list of these APIs, especially not all the meta data for API operations including documentation, code libraries, pricing and terms of service, let alone a machine readable definition of the surface area using Swagger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-internal-api.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>I now had three separate APIs.json files, one for my own internal APIs, one for my own APIs I offer up publicly, and a third for the distributed public APIs that I depend on for my operations. I didn't just have a single index of my APIs, I had essentially mapped out all of my stack, providing me with a single location I could go to find all my APIs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-map-pin.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>This isn't just about providing the public with a discovery solution for my APIs, it is also about me understanding my entire surface area. Something that honestly, showed me what a mess much of my infrastructure was, but regardless, at least now it was mapped out and known, for good or bad. For the first time, I felt like there was potential for getting my house in order--then Docker happened.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/docker/docker-logo.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>The new containerization solution provided me a new way to look at my architecture. Rather than one big MySQL instance, and a support Linux / PHP / Apache server instance, I could deploy a single Docker instance, with many little LAMP nodes, each with the basic configuration I needed to run my APIs. Rather than having all my APIs served up via one server, I was able to essentially break up each API, and put into its own, independent container.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-stacks.png" alt="" width="25%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>Sure, my APIs still ran on a single AWS EC2 instance, but now they each ran in individual Docker containers which could be easily fired up in separate instances, running in any infrastructure, something I would test out later. For now, I was happy knowing that I could slowly separate out each of my APIs, allowing them to act independently of each other, with hopes that a single API could fail, without bringing the entire stack to its needs. Conversely, each API could be independently scaled to meet my specific needs of just that API, without be forced to scale all my APIs.</p>
<p>At the same moment, another thought process was evolving, something that really wasn't much different than what I could already do, but provided me a strong incentive for rethinking how I approached my architecture, something that was not just complemented by, but also facilitated by Docker containerization--Microservices.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-micro-definition.png" alt="" width="25%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>Microservices is more philosophy, than a concrete technology like Docker, but it provides a healthy basis for thinking about how you design, deploy, and manage your APIs. With this in mind I set forth crafting my own definition, of just exactly what micro meant to me, something that is proving to be a very personal thing, evolving from individual to individual, and company to company.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>minimal surface</strong><br /><strong> minimal on disk</strong><br /><strong> minimal compute</strong><br /><strong> minimal message</strong><br /><strong> minimal network</strong><br /><strong> minimal time to rebuild</strong><br /><strong> minimal time to throw away</strong><br /><strong> minimal ownership</strong><br /><strong> minimal dependencies</strong></p>
<p>A microservice way of thinking, coupled with Docker enabled containerization, has allowed me to rethink how I design, and deploy my APIs. While I'm not fully subscribing to popular opinions around what is a microservice, it is allowing me to rethink many of my own architectural patterns. However this new way of thinking, came with some shortcomings, around how I uniquely identify API resources, as well as discover resources, but luckily I already had been working on solutions in these areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-design.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>All of my APIs were already defined using Swagger, which essentially provided me with a fingerprint of each API, that I can use to uniquely identify each API, as well as quantify the entire surface area, such as how many endpoints, parameters, and details about underlying data model, and message formats. I now had, my solution for API identification, but what about API discovery?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-json/apis-json-apis-with-swagger.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>As I contemplated untangling the legacy API mess I had created for myself, I was concerned that if I reduced the size of each API, spawning new APIs, I would eventually have over 500 individual APIs, potentially creating even more of a nightmare for myself. Luckily I had already started hanging these APIs onto an APIs.json file, something I can continue to replicate into smaller, more isolated groups, while also linking up using the APIs.json include collection. I would no longer have just three APIs.json files, I would have many nodes of APIs, indexed using APIs.json, with a master APIs.json as the doorway to my increasingly decoupled world.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-json/kin-lane-master-stack.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>As I got to work redefining my API stack, I couldn't disrupt my current set of APIs I have deployed to API Evangelist, so I decided to publish this core set of tools under the KinLane.com domain. It actually makes sense, because many of the APIs are not directly related to API Evangelist, spanning larger work that I do. My brand is bigger than just API Evangelist, it is just one node underneath the Kin Lane brand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/kin.png" alt="" width="18%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>After completing the first wave of converting my legacy API stack, using my new containerized, micro design approach, each complete with its own Swagger, and APIs.json, I end up with 25 separate APIs, with over 250 endpoints. This provided me with a next generation blueprint of my API stack, that I could easy follow, add to, and evolve over time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-json/kin-lane-master-apis.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>As I carved off each API, defining the next generation I worked to keep as small, and self-contained as possible. My link API, became link, curation, and linkrot APIs, with additional supporting services for screen capture, pulling content, and other utilities as their own, individual endpoints.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>/links/</strong><br /><strong> /curated/</strong><br /><strong> /linkrot/</strong><br /><strong> /screencapture/</strong></p>
<p>My images API is getting similar treatment and carving off many of the support utilities as stand alone features so that I can use them separately. While I may use resize, compress, and other utilities in conjunction with my core images API, many times this won't be the case, especially if I open up to the outside world.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>/images/</strong><br /><strong> /resize/</strong><br /><strong> /compression/</strong><br /><strong> /filter/</strong></p>
<p>This process of reducing the scope of my APIs isn't just about size, it is also about isolation of services, keeping my APIs doing one thing, and doing it well. Allowing me to deploy, scale, and migrate my services exactly as I see fit. While my definition of a microservice may not be everyone else, it helps provide a guide for me as I'm evolving legacy APIs, as well as defining and evolving new ones. With my new stack, I can now begin to think about how I deploy my cloud infrastructure a little differently.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>AWS = Containers</strong><br /><strong> Google = Containers<br />Microsoft = Containers</strong></p>
<p>I can easily fire up a Docker stack in both AWS and Google, both using the exact same LAMP stack configuration, and pull in each of my API definitions, allowing me to easily deploy, and migrate between cloud providers. To accomplish this, it isn't as if I can drag one container from AWS to Google, I rely on Git, or more specifically Github to help me achieve this.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-json/kin-lane-master-apis.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>Each API lives as its own Github repository, with every aspect of its existence present either within the private master branch of the repository, and some of it available in a public gh-pages branch. Using Github I store the server side PHP code I will use when deploying each Docker container, but I also story the data model, data backups in the private, secure master branch of the repository.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-github.png" alt="" width="25%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>At the center of reach Github repository is the APIs.json for the API, providing of index of not just meta data about the API, but its Swagger fingerprint, server code, client code, and other essential elements of operations. When I fire up a new Docker container, I reference where to find its server side API code, which also simultaneously provides it with the Github organization and repo where it can find its APIs.json index.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/3scale/github-repo-store.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>This approach allows me to easily fire up containers in any cloud provider that supports Docker, which is pretty much all of them in 2015. The best part of this, is I can also deploy locally in my own home or office, using a local server, or even via Raspberry Pi (work in progress).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/3scale/raspberry-pi-docker.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>Another important aspect of this evolution of my API stack, is that as I've decoupled my APIs, allowing them to reborn as a decoupled set of independent portable APIs, forever changing how I design and deploy my APIs, my API management is also undergoing the same treatment. You see, if my APIs can migrate and move, so does the API management layer that I use to orchestrate them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/3scale/3scale-localized.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>To begin with, I need the basic ability to mange my API consumers. I need the basic controls for managing access to all the APIs contained within a stack, alongside all my APIs, as an equal resource.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong><strong>api.apievangelist.com</strong>/users/</strong><br /><strong>User Create</strong><br /><strong>User Read</strong><br /><strong>User Update</strong><br /><strong>User Delete</strong></p>
<p>With the ability to add, read, update, and delete users on my platform, I also need to the ability to manage each of the accounts. This way I can directly access each account within my API stack, but more importantly my API consumers can also manage their own accounts using the same APIs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>api.apievangelist.com/account/</strong><br /><strong> Account Set Credit Card</strong><br /><strong> Account Delete Credit Card</strong><br /><strong> Invoice By Account</strong><br /><strong> Invoice Line Item List</strong><br /><strong> Invoice Payment Transaction List</strong></p>
<p>A key part of my API management infrastructure is the concept of service composition. Using 3Scale I have created multiple tiers of access to APIs, allowing for a public free, entry level layer, as well as higher levels of paid, partner, and internal access. I need the details of these service plans I've created, including their features to move with my API infrastructure.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong><strong>api.apievangelist.com</strong>/services/</strong><br /><strong> Service Plan List</strong><br /><strong> Service Plan Feature List</strong><br /><strong> Service Plan Set To Default</strong></p>
<p>As each of my API consumers register, and manage their API access, the next level of API access is handled through the application level management layer. 3Scale gives me the tools to do this, which I've extended as individual API endpoints.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong><strong>api.apievangelist.com</strong>/applications/</strong><br /><strong> Application Plan List (per isolated service)</strong><br /><strong> Application List</strong><br /><strong> Application Create</strong><br /><strong> Application Read</strong><br /><strong> Application Update</strong><br /><strong> Application Change Plan</strong><br /><strong> Application Key List</strong><br /><strong> Application Key Create</strong><br /><strong> Application Key Delete</strong><br /><strong> Application Usage by Metric</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of other services that 3Scale API infrastructure gives me, but this represent the v1 API stack I need to help orchestrate this new, containerized, potentially distributed API stack I've setup for myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/3scale/Interactive-Docs-3scale-Documentation.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></a></strong></p>
<p>Eventually I'd like to see entire 3SCale infrastructure decoupled, similar to my stack, giving me, and my consumers to access all API management features, right alongside the other API resources I am providing--giving me a pretty complete stack. Now I'm ready for the higher level evolution of my APIs, between my two organizations.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>With my new approach I can easily establish a new Github organization for API Evangelist, pick exactly the APIs I want, fork them to my new organization, deploy a new container server on AWS, Google, or wherever I need it, and have a brand new stack. I will use the same 3Scale API infrastructure account to manage both my Kin Lane and API Evangelist API stack, so other than deploying the individual APIs, there is no configuration needed, my API management follows my APIs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/3scale/3scale-key.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>All along the way, I've been on-boarding new API consumers, as well as migrated the users who have historically used my API Evangelist stack of APIs. Some of these users have shown interest in being able to scale their usage of some of my APIs. These tend to not be the core blog, or company APIs I've developed as part of my monitoring of the API space, they are other more utility APIs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>/screencapture/</strong><br /><strong> /image/resize/</strong><br /><strong> /api/swagger/</strong></p>
<p>While many of my users are perfectly happy using these utility APIs via my API stack, some of them have expressed interest in being able to scale the API to meet the demands of their operations. Just as I will scale up Docker containers for my own needs, my customers are hoping to do this same, or possibly even deploy my API designs, in their own infrastructure -- opening up a whole new level of API monetization for me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-wholesale.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>I can even take this to the next level, and deploy entire API stacks for customers, their infrastructure or mine. Providing all APIs, via an a la carte menu, giving an entire new dimension to my API deployment strategy. I can deploy API stacks, exactly as I need them, for my own needs, or for my customers--using the same API infrastructure. The best part of this, is it isn't just about deploying API infrastructure of my needs, my customers can get in on the API provider game.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-provider.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>My customers can start by consuming APIs, then evolve to deploying them within their own infrastructure, and when ready, they can open up these APIs to their own customers, and the way my 3Scale infrastructure works, I can switch them over to their own API management account at any time, with no changes needed. I just create a new top level account, change the master API management key from mine to theirs, replicate service levels, and their customers can start signing up, and consuming their APIs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-open.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>This approach to API deployment and management opens up not just a new way of monetizing APIs at a wholesale level, it opens up the power of being an API provider to my API community. Another interesting aspect of this approach is because each API comes complete with a machine readable Swagger API definition, and APIs.json file index, each API, and each API stack is easily discoverable, and open to the delivery of API focused services, from 3rd party providers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-services.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>In 2015, more API service providers are supporting Swagger, and other common API definition formats like API Blueprint, as a way to on board, configure, automate, and access valuable API services in the cloud, or even on-premise. While to many Swagger is a way to generate interactive documentation or client code libraries, it is being used by a growing number of companies for much, much more.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://apiscience.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-science/api-science-logo.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></a></strong></p>
<p>Using API Science I can import the Swagger files for my APIs, and generate the monitors I need to keep an eye on API operations. Once API monitors are setup, I receive regular emails per my account, and can embed dashboard tools for helping me visualize my platform availability.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://www.runscope.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/runscope/runscope-logo.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></a></strong></p>
<p>Similar to API Science, using Runscope, I can import Swagger definitions into my account, and automate the setup of tests, which I can run as part of my regular platform monitoring and testing--saving serious time in how I monitor my APIs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/postman/postman-logo.png" alt="" width="20%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>Postman allows me to import my Swagger definitions, and create ready to go API calls, where I can see easily understand the request and responses of all my API calls, collaborate with other API consumers on my team. Postman allows me to easily work with my APIs, without a UI, and with some of my APis, is how I engage -- never quite needing a full UI.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://smartbear.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/smartbear/SmartBear-Logo.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></a></strong></p>
<p>SmartBear also allows you to import Swagger, and allow you to generate mock and virtualized APis, run testing, monitoring, performance, and security tests against your APIs. Using Swagger I can quickly configure a number of vital services I need to operate a healthy platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/3scale/apis-json-properties-postman.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></a></strong></p>
<p>This is something that isn't just machine readable, and can be translated into UI, browser, IDE, and other more human aspects of API integration and engagement.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/3scale/blog-apis-json-postman.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>While none of these service providers listed, currently support the importing of APIs.json, only Swagger -- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">eventually they will.</span> APIs.json will provide a single entry point that these API service providers can import not just one, but many APIs, and configure valuable services throughout an APIs life cycle. An example of this in action can be found using the APIs.io API search engine.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://apis.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apis-io/apis-io.png" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></a></strong></p>
<p>APIs.io provides an APIs.json import, allowing you to index all of your APis, and the supporting elements of API operations. Once indexed, APIs will be available to the public, via the open source API search engine. This is just the beginning of APIs.json enabled search, other providers are getting in the game as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://wso2.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/wso2/wso2-logo-white-400X180-tr.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></a></strong></p>
<p>With the next release of the WSO2 API management platform, API providers will be able to organize APIs, and export them as APIs.json collections, opening up for either listing in the public APis.io search engine, but also opening up for the deployment of private, internal API search engines using either APIs.io, which is open source, or the deployment of a custom solution. I have also begun delivering tooling that employs APIs.json, for delivering vital services along the API life cycle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/3scale/api-codegen.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>Using the Swagger Codegen project, which is an open source solution for generating client side libraries, I deployed an API that accepts any valid APIs.json file, and return seven separate client side libraries, from the Swagger definition. While these are by no means a perfect client solution, it provides a nice start for some developers to get going, eliminating some of the more redundant aspects of API integration.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/3scale/apis-json-properties-postman.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>An advantage of using APIs.json to index API operations, and on board API service providers, is that it can provide access to one, or many API definitions, as well as other aspects of API operations, like documentation, code, pricing. While many of these aspects are not machine readable, once an API has been imported into a service providers platform, these other elements can provide important references that service providers can use to determine next steps. I'd call this level of API service delivery a more inbound approach, but APIs.json also brings outbound effects to the table.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/3scale/apis-json-api-science-outbound.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>Once a service has been rendered, service providers can also provide other elements that can be hung on an APIs.json, just as with Swagger, and other elements of operations. I am already including references to Postman collections in my APIs.json files, and have begun adding API Science statistics and visualizations as part of regular API indexing details.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-recycling.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>This provides both an inbound opportunity for the delivery of new services, but also the publishing of essential outcomes from those services being delivered, that can benefit API service providers. These details can also provide important elements for other API service providers to use. Imagine if API providers like API Change Log could pull in API Science and Runscope details to enhance and augment their own services, providing more details about the availability of services, and the changes that have occurred--then API Change Log can publish their own results, further enriching the index for each API.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-apis-json-community-driven.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>This opens up a community effect, when it comes to delivering vital services throughout an API life cycle. As an API provider I do not have to do everything myself. I can design, deploy, and management my APIs, then allow service providers to index my APIs.json, and demonstrate the value their services deliver, and then choose which services I need--making the API life cycle a more community driven affair, opening the door up to a wealth of potential APIs.json driven services.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><strong>API Testing</strong><br /><strong> API Monitoring</strong><br /><strong> API Discovery</strong><br /><strong> API Performance</strong><br /><strong> API Proxy</strong><br /><strong> API Cache</strong><br /><strong> API Performance</strong><br /><strong> API Visualization</strong><br /><strong> API Dictionary</strong></p>
<p>As an API provider I do not have time to do everything, and many of the API service providers out there need valuable meta data about API operations to offer, enhance, and evolve their service offerings. I can take these services and improve my API operations, no matter where these APIs exist, publicly or privately--all I need is an APIs.json file as the seed. All of this moves APIs.json well beyond just discovery, and like Swagger provides a central truth for not just defining the API, but defining entire API operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-operations.png" alt="" width="40%" align="center" /></strong></p>
<p>We still have a long way to go, before all aspects of API operations are machine readable, but APIs.json can be used today for indexing of the technical side of operations, and with the help of API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint, these elements of operations, can be read, imported, and acted upon programmatically both other systems. Since all of my APIs, now live in their own Github repositories, with APIs.json as a central index, pull requests can be made adding elements to the index, potentially by 3rd parties--further making the API life cycle a community effort.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-technology-of-apis.png" alt="" width="35%" align="center" /></p>
<p>Swagger and API Blueprint have solidly moved beyond an interesting new advancement of the API space, they are being used by start ups, small businesses, enterprise groups, and even government agencies to define the technical side of API operations. When bundled with APIs.json, we can build a machine readable bridge to the other aspects of API operations, like the business side.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-business-of-apis.png" alt="" width="35%" align="center" /></p>
<p>Swagger and API Blueprint both started by providing interactive API documentation, an essential building block for on-boarding API consumers, which is more about API business, then the technical details. These API definition are now moving into other business areas like delivering how-two materials, potentially driving pricing, dashboard elements, or other embeddable elements that can be used across API operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-politics-of-apis.png" alt="" width="35%" align="center" /></p>
<p>With the introduction of machine readable API licensing formats like API Commons, the legal, or as I call it, the political aspects of API operations comes into play as well. I am using APIs.json to connect the service composition, tiers, and rate limits, to the technical, and business details that are indexed in an APIs.json file. This is just the beginning, soon other aspects like terms of service, patents, and deprecation policies can also be included, further expanding the APIs.json index of each API, and the collections of APIs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/tech-business-politics-03-2014.png" alt="" width="90%" /></p>
<p>This is a story of my own infrastructure, but is derived from the research I do across the API space. I work hard to not be just an API pundit, and actually practice what I preach. I'm slowly moving from the academic version of this, to a fully functional version, that is my own architecture that I use to run the API Evangelist network.</p>
<p>I gave a version of this talk last night at 3Scale offices, and will be giving various versions of it at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">APIDays Mediterranea</a> this coming week in Barcelona, and again at <a href="http://gluecon.com/">Gluecon in Colorado</a>, on May 20th. Over the summer I will continue to evolve my architecture for both Kin Lane and API Evangelist, and evolve a new set of stories, and talks that I can give, helping me share my approach.</p>
<p>I will publish the slide deck of each talk that I give at APIDays and Gluecon on my Github repo when ready, for everyone to reference. Thanks for paying attention.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclosure:</strong> 3Scale and WSO2 are both API Evangelist Partners</em></p>

<p>After <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/27/thank-you-berlin-for-helping-make-apidaysberlin--apistrat-europe-so-amazing/">recovering from an amazing week in Berlin for APIDaysBerlin / APIStrat Europe 2015</a>, and catching up on some work, which <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/28/weekly-apireport-for-april-27th-2015/">included a 20 hour push to get the last weeks API.Report completed</a>, I am now preparing for <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">API Days Mediterranea, May 6th &amp; 7th in Barcelona, Spain</a>. The event is billed as "The Independent Conference on APIs, NLP, and Language Technology", and brings together may of the leading API minds, but also the cross-over with APIs and language technology--something you won't see anywhere else.</p>
<p>While the main event is next Wednesday and Thursday, things kick off the night before, on Tuesday, May 5th with some pre-conference workshops and partying at 3Scales office:</p>
<ul>
<li>17:30 - Practical 3scale API Management Crash Course at 3scale's office (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/API-Meetup-Barcelona/events/221808677/">register</a>)</li>
<li>19:00 - API Meetup Barcelona: Marketing APIs: Do's and Dont's and APIdays warm-up party at 3scale's office (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/API-Meetup-Barcelona/events/221808517/">register</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then starting Wednesday, the main event kicks off with many of the usual suspects, who don't just lead in the API industry, but also work very hard traveling the world evangelizing API best practices:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>It doesn't stop there. What really makes me happy about APIDays, is the increasing number of local, and regional API talent the event attracts. I see a number of other talented API prfoessional, doing some very interesting talks, ranging from the business of APIs to hypermedia. This is the most important aspect of APIDays in my opinion, is that it doesn't just import API talent from around the world, it also cultivates and grows local and regional API voices.</p>
<p><a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apidays-mediteranea-2.jpg" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>I will also be speaking, closing up the two day event, with a talk on what I'm calling "A Community Driven API Lifecycle", where I'll showcase some of the work I'm doing around the tech, business, and politics of APIs, driven by Swagger, Docker, and brought together using APIs.json. This is the first in a series of talks I'll be doing on this subject, concluding with Gluecon in Colorado, later this month.</p>
<p><a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">If you aren't registered, visit the site and get signed up before all the tickets are gone, the space is limited, and I know they have already sold most of the tickets</a>. I look forward to hanging out with some of my old friends in the space, as well as making some new ones, and hearing their stories of API design, deployment, management, discovery, and integration, in one of the my favorite cities--Barcelona.</p>

<p>This week's report was a painful one, because I did very little work last week when it came to monitoring the space, thus I was forced to play catch up this week after <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23apisberlin&amp;src=typd">#APIsBerlin</a>. It took 20 hours to produce this work, and get myself up to speed. #ouch</p>
<p><span>My Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>

<p>I am still coming off the high that was&nbsp;<a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe</a> this last April 23rd through 25th in Berlin. There were a number of talks that I enjoyed, ranging from open data, to 3D printing, to hypermedia--too many to list. I love the German view of technology, data privacy, and generally on what is going on in the United States.</p>
<p>Other than the wifi issues, the conference was a success. We sold out the event, with 450 people in attendance (goal was 400), and even with the final day being on a Saturday, the turnout was very impressive. Each session I ran, was full of questions, with an IoT session, and another architecture session running 10 minutes over, because there were so many good questions, I didn't want to stop.</p>
<p><a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/apistrat-berlin-2015/apistrat-berlin-pano1.jpg" alt="" width="95%" /></a></p>
<p>We are processing the videos from the conference, which I will spend time watching each one--telling stories along the way. So keep an eye out on API Evangelist, and on the <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/category/blog/">@APIStrat blog</a> for each video release, as we will be trickling them out as each video comes off the production line over the next couple of weeks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you to 3Scale, APIDays, and Commerce Tools to for making sure this amazing event came together. I'm just now getting my brain back in gear, so look for more &nbsp;@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat stories over next couple weeks!</p>

<p>In addition to helping be the MC for the API event, one of the conversation I am facilitating at&nbsp;<a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe this Friday in Berlin</a>, is an open data discussion on the main stage. What better place to discuss the world of open data and API, then in Germany. The country has some of the strictest laws when it comes to protecting the privacy of German citizens, and when it comes to API access to data, I couldn't think of a better place to have an open discussion in 2015.</p>
<p>I have invited two data specialists to the stage Friday afternoon:</p>

<p>I am looking forward to hearing what Ali and Jonathan have to say about open data, from a European perspective. To help stimulate the conversation, I've also invited one of our keynotes to join us:</p>

<p>I do not have a list of questions prepared for these gentlemen. I think we all know the space well enough, just discussing who they are, their projects, and the wider open data space is sure to fill up 30 minutes of main stage action. I am eager to hear Chris's keynote as well, as I'm extremely interested in what <a href="https://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a> is doing.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/04/20/weekly-apireport-for-april-20th-2015/">Weekly API.Report For April 20th, 2015</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">20 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://api.report/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-report/api-report-logo.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><span>My Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Accessibility</strong></span> is something I'm pushing more on:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/04/14/box-acquires-interactive-3d-viewing-startup-verold-will-integrate-tech-into-its-enterprise-platform/">Box acquires interactive 3D viewing startup Verold, will integrate tech into its enterprise platform</a> - 3D viewing is something the enterprise wants in their documents? ok.&nbsp;</li>

<p>That concludes my report on what I read last week across the API  space. I'm still working on pulling together a summary e-newsletter  version, allowing people to get an executive summary of what I thought  was important from the week--I am hoping it will be available next week.  I'm also going to auto-generate some visualizations, and summary counts  for each week. I'd like to see a tag cloud, and overall counts to help  me understand the scope of news I cover each week.</p>
<p>If you know of something I missed, feel free to email or tweet at me,  and make sure I know about your company, and have a link to your blog  RSS. If you don't tell the story and share, the world will never know it  happened.</p>
<p>It is a good time to be tracking on the API space--lots going on!</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/carvoyant/carvoyant-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm very fortunate to be the API Evangelist, as I get to spend my days discussing, some very lofty ideas, with extremely smart and entrepreneurial folks from across many different business sectors. An ongoing conversation I have going on with Bret Tobey (<a href="https://twitter.com/batobey">@batobey</a>), the CEO of <a href="https://www.carvoyant.com/">Carvoyant</a>, is around the big data generated around the Internet of Things. Many companies that I engage with are very closed about their big data operations, where Carvoyant is the opposite, they want to openly discuss, and figure it out as a community, out in the open--something I fully support.</p>
<p>In reality, the Internet of Things (IoT) is less about devices, than it is about the data that is produced. If someone is exclusively focusing on the device as part of their pitch, it is mostly likely they are trying to distract you from the data being generated, because they are looking to monetize the IoT data exhaust for themselves. Carvoyant is keen on discussing the realities of IoT data exhaust, and not just from Internet connected automobile perspective, but also the wider world of Internet connected devices. If you want to join in the discussion, of course you can comment on this blog, and via Twitter, but <a href="http://gluecon.com/announcing-the-apistrat-un-workshops/">you can also come to Gluecon in May, where 3Scale, API Evangelist, and Carvoyant will be conducting an IoT big data workshop</a>, on this topic.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.carvoyant.com">If you aren't familiar with Carvoyant, they are an API-driven device that you can connect to your vehicle, if it was manufactured after 1996, and access the volumes of data being produced each day</a>. Carvoyant's tag line says "Your Car, Your Data, Your API" -- I like that. This is why I enjoy talking through their strategy, because they see the world of APIs, connected devices, and big data the way I do. Sure there is lots of opportunity for platforms, and developers to make money in all of this, but if there is user generated content and data involved, the end-users should also have a stake in the action--I do not care how good your business idea is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carvoyant does a great job of acknowledging that the car is center to our existence, and the data generated around our vehicles is potentially very valuable, but it is also a very personal thing, even when anonymized. Here is how they put it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Connected car data tells the repair industry when a vehicle needs service &ndash; the moment it happens. &nbsp;Connected car data tells an insurer how a driver actually drives and if they are eligible for a better priced policy. &nbsp;Connected car data tells gas stations if a vehicle is low on gas. &nbsp;If a vehicle has not been to the grocery store for a while, than it may be time to make an offer.</em></p>
<p>The difference in this conversation, is Carvoyant isn't just making this pitch to investors, the automobile industry, and developers, they are making it to the automobile owners as well. They are working to establish best practices for gathering, accessing, storing, and making sense of Internet of Things data exhaust, in a way that keeps the end-users interests in mind. Every platform should think this way. There is too much exploitation going on around user-generated data, and Carvoyants vision is important.</p>
<p><strong>Monetization Via Classic Affiliate Program</strong><br />When it comes to figuring out a healthy monetization strategy for the Carvoyant platform, and resulting data, the company is starting with a familiar concept, the affiliate program. Establishing potential referral networks, where end-consumers, and developers of apps can refer potential customers to businesses, and when there is a successful sale, an affiliate commisison is paid out. This is a great place to start, because it is a concept that businesses, developers, and consumers will understand and be able to operate within, without changing much on the ground behavior.</p>
<p>If you identify a customer in need of vehicle servicing, and successfully refer them to a local service center, you can be paid money for making the connection, something that when done right could also be applied to the end-user in form of credits, discounts, and other loyalty opportunities. An affiliate approach to the monetization of data via the Carvoyant API makes for an easy sell, but one that can be applied to a myriad of business sectors ranging from automobile services to food, shopping, travel, and much, much more. While an affiliate base is being established, Carvoyant can also begin to look towards the future, and shifting behavior.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-highway-open.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Monetization Beyond Affiliate</strong><br />While I'm fine with Carvoyant kicking off their monetization strategy with a calssic affiliate program, I feel pretty strongly there are many other opportunities for monetization, something that Bret agrees too. When you think about the central role cars play in our lives, the opportunities for inciting meaningful experiences, are endless. While the real money is probably around the mundane realities of the average car owner, the chances for serendipity, beyond these known areas is the exciting aspect. How do you not just help users find the best time to get their oil changed, but also take that side street, instead of freeway that might involve a chance experience that could range from dinner, to concert, or just find that right sunset location.</p>
<p>There is a pretty clear conversion event involved with the affiliate model. A user clicks on just the right deal, a sale is made, and revenue is kicked back from the business to the platform, developer, and is something that hopefully reaches the end-user in meaningful way. What other types of "conversion events" (man I hate that phrase) can we identify in car culture. How do we encourage people to take public transit, share vehicles, or how do we make large fleets operate more in harmony? With the right platform, I think we can quickly go beyond the traditional affiliate transaction, and develop a new wave of monetization around IoT data, that goes beyond just eyeballs, and links, and is more about engagement and true experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Experience Credits Not Just Sales&nbsp;<br /></strong>Just like moving beyond the affiliate conversion event, I think we can go beyond the transaction also being currency or sale based. How do we create a more experience based currency or credit system that can be used equally to help businesses generate sales, and establish loyalty with customers, but also allow developers and end-consumers to exchange units of value, attached to valuable automobile data? If a $20.00 deal on a $30.00 oil change, results in a $2.00 affiliate revenue share, what would the value of pulling off the freeway, taking the side road and catching just the right sunset picture be worth? How do we incentivize experiences, not just sales? If we are continuing to weave data generated from our physical worlds, it cannot always be about money, there has to be other value generated, that will keep end-users engaged in valuable, yet meaningful ways.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Economy</strong><br />As our worlds continue to change, partially because of technology, but also because of other environmental and societal pressures, what value, sales, and experiences can be generated from the data exhaust produced as part of the sharing economy? If its our car, our data, and our API--does this apply when it involves our ZipCar usage, rental car, or possibly Uber? How does the sharing economy impact data generated via connected cars. When the end-user is the center of the conversations, these alternate use cases have to be included, and make sure privacy is protected, but also opportunities around that data to be securely shared with users. This isn't just a shared automobile data conversation, it is potentially applicable to any other objects we rent and share like tools, equipment, supplies, and anything else we may use as part of our business and personal lives.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial Fleets<br /></strong>Just like the data exhaust from personally owned vehicles, or automobiles used as part of the sharing economy, the opportunities, and patterns available for commercial fleets will look very different. How do we incentivize efficiency, cost savings, and safety in fleet operations? What do the affiliate deals, and experiences look like for fleet vehicle drives, and the companies that own and manage them. Think of the implications of big data exhaust from vehicles in heavily regulated industries, and public service entities like police, and fire. We will also have to think very differently about how revenue is generated and shared, as well as look at privacy and security very differently. This doesn't reduce the opportunity in the area of fleet management, it just needs a significantly different conversation about what we need for this class of automobile.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing Common Blueprints&nbsp;<br /></strong>Beyond the individual conversion events for individual drives, or the wider opportunities for sharing economy companies, and commercial fleet operators, where are the opportunities around identifying common patterns of vehicle usage at scale? How does the vehicle usage of the LAPD differ from NYPD? What does the average residential vehicle owner in San Diego look like, versus the rental car tourist for San Diego? Using connected vehicle technology like Carvoyant opens up a huge opportunity for better understanding car culture at a macro level, beyond what the auto industry, or maybe Department of Transportation sees. How do we begin having honest conversations about our vehicle usage, and allow drivers to be educated about larger studies, allowing them as a company or individual to opt in, and share data, to participate in larger studies? We have to make sure and consider the bigger opportunities for understanding beyond any single endpoint on the connected car network, and look at entire cities, states, countries, and other meaningful demographics.</p>

<p><strong>Lots More To Discuss, Something That Needs Transparency<br /></strong>This is just the beginning of these types of discussions. I have a handful of companies, like https://www.carvoyant.com, who have access to huge volumes of extremely valuable user-generated data, who are trying to figure out how to developer useful tech, make money, all while doing it in a healthy way that protects end-users privacy and security. I am not opposed to companies making money off their API platforms, and user generated data, I just insist that APIs always be used to make it more transparent, and technology such as oAuth employed to give end-users more control, and a vote in how their data is collected, stored, shared.</p>
<p>This post is about me working through my last conversation with Bret, and hopefully will result in several more stories here on the blog. <a href="http://gluecon.com/announcing-the-apistrat-un-workshops/">I also want to prime the pump for the APIStrat IoT Big Data Workshop at Gluecon in May, and make sure my readers are aware the workshop will be happening, and if you want to join in the conversation</a>. This is just one of many posts you'll see from me discussing the big data exhaust generated from Internet connected devices, but also the potential for transparency and healthier platform operations when APIs and oAuth are employed. These types conversations are only going to become more critical as more of our physical worlds are connected to the Internet.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-hurdles.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was reading&nbsp;<a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2015/04/15/obama-administration-agrees-with-sunlight-agencies-should-disclose-what-data-they-keep-private/">Obama administration agrees with Sunlight: Agencies should disclose what data they keep private</a>, which is a topic I follow closely, as I'm passionate about government opening up their data inventory, but also because worked as a Presidential Innovation Fellow on helping agencies open up their data. I completely agree that agencies should have to disclose lists of even their private enterprise data repository, to help establish a clear picture of just exactly what is public or private government data.</p>
<p>While reading the post, I noticed the statement that, <em>"most agencies seem to have accepted and understood the need for this change, but some concerns have been voiced"</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Department of Commerce, which holds a very sizable amount of data, has cited &ldquo;certain technological issues that are creating major barriers to creating the PDL as described [in OMB&rsquo;s guidance].&rdquo; This is a concern, but Commerce appears to be working through these issues with relevant officials in the General Services Administration and OMB.</li>
<li>NASA has expressed significant concerns with the new process, specifically citing pushback and time constraints from its FOIA office and legal team. They claim that &ldquo;identifying and indexing our open data is our priority,&rdquo; and indexing its non-public data will take valuable capacity away. Fortunately, NASA has bought into the public process and are engaged in meaningful conversation about the agency's concerns on the Project Open Data Github.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is interesting that agencies cite the technology challenges in complying with open data mandates. In my experience working on opening up government data, right after the education of the average government employee, challenges imposed by the technology they use is one of the biggest hurdles. To make my point, you can't find "Export Spreadsheet to JSON" as a Microsoft Excel option. Most systems encourage the output of PDFs from core systems, which when it is combined with lack of open data export capabilities, makes opening up of inventories extra work.</p>
<p>We need to continue the hard work to educate the average government employee about open data principles, and the little things they can do in their daily work, to help collectively move their agency towards being more open, and machine readable by default. However, we also need to push harder on software vendors, who are providing technological solutions to make sure the imports and exports of data in open, machine readable formats is a default feature. There also needs to be more mandatory API language in procurement contracts, requring APIs to be baked in by default in all government systems--should never be an afterthought.</p>
<p>There is only so much responsibility that we can place on the average government employee, trying to get their job done on a daily basis. All of the companies who are profiting off selling the government software solutions, also need to share in the responsibility, and help make sure our government is equipped with the proper tools. Government being open and machine readable by default shouldn't create extra work for agencies, it should help reduce their workload.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://withknown.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/known/known-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I see a lot of software come and go. I adopt applications, tools, and online services for a variety of reasons, with some of these tools remaining a regular part my operations, with others coming and going with time. I'm currently abandoning Evernote, in favor of my own home brew note tool, while I'm also adopting a handful of new <a href="https://luckymarmot.com/paw">HTTP Client tools like Paw</a>. There are a number of reasons these tools go away, sometimes the reason I needed them shifts, other times they evolve to a point where they are no longer useful to me, and other times they go away after an acquisition, or running out of money, and not being able to keep the lights on. In the end, when i find tools I believe in, and deeply integrate them into my life, and want to better understand how I can help ensure they will be successful.</p>
<p>One tool that I am using as part of my daily operations is <a href="https://withknown.com/">Known</a>. If you are unfamiliar,&nbsp;Known it is a simple, social publishing platform for your blog or website. I'm am personally invested in helping the Known founders find the customers they need to be successful, and as part of this effort I wanted to practice explaining Known to my readers, while I also expand my own understanding of the role Known can play in my own operations.</p>
<p><strong>Reclaim Your Domain</strong><br />For me, Known is about reclaiming my domain. Rather than posting tweets to Twitter, I post to Known, and using the Twitter API, Known publishes a copy of the Tweet to Twitter. I maintain the original copy of my Tweet. When I write a wall post I can publish to LinkedIn, as well as Facebook, with the original content staying in Known. <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">This is all about POSSE for me, which is&nbsp;Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere</a>. As a professional who operates in online world, it is extremely important to me to retain ownership over my content, and intellectual exhaust.</p>
<p><strong>Managing My Life Bits</strong><br />Known allows me to manage a significant portion of my life bits, which include simple status updates, posts, photos, bookmarks, and audio, then provides me with a handful of connected services like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and SoundCloud which I can then syndicate these life bits to. The important piece of this for me, is thinking about my life bits, independent of the services I use to publish and manage or publish these life bits. Employing a POSSE approach allows me to decouple these valuable life bits, and manage them in a central location, which helps me achieve my goal of keeping control my digital exhaust.</p>
<p><strong>Syndication Channels</strong><br />The cloud version of Known offers a handful of common channels for me to syndicate my life bits to, including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Flickr, Foursquare, and SoundCloud. I'm not a big Foursquare user anymore, but I'm still active on all the other channels, and Known provides me a simple interface for managing syndication to these channels. &nbsp;The cloud version of Known is a great start for any individual, or organization looking to get a handle on their basic</p>
<p><strong>Public or Private Page</strong><br />Beyond the whole syndication aspect, Known provides an important aggregation, and centralization feature for me, by providing a single public, or private page (if I decide), where I can find all of my syndicated Known content. Since most of my presence is public, <a href="https://kinlane.withknown.com/">I keep it open as a single, public place where you can find all of the content I syndicate across Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn</a>. With a simple keyword search available, the platform provides a valuable resource that I am increasingly using to re-discover content across my network.</p>
<p><strong>Plugins and Webhooks</strong><br />Where Known really starts to get exciting for me, is when it comes to the extensibility via plugins and webhooks. First I can create simple webhooks for syndicating out my life bits to custom channels of my choosing. It is easy for me to setup custom webhooks, that can handle various syndication scenarios for me. After that I can create plugins, something I haven't done yet, so I can't speak intelligently about. I am working to carve out time to setup my own custom Known installation, and craft my first API driven plugin. I envision this as the gateway to not just syndicating to other public channels, but also to custom, private channels that I define.</p>
<p><strong>API Driven Known Targets</strong><br />The default syndication channels that Known provides, coupled with the opportunities the plugins and webhooks introduce, open up an endless amount of POSSE scenarios for me. I envision an entire API stack deployed to support various types of Known installations. I'd like to see API driven docker containers that can auto deploy with a push of a button to provide additional syndication channels for Known. Once you have a POSSE approach established with Known, defining new API driven channels that you can take advantage of, brokering further sydnication, transformation, and storage of all of my personal and business life bits, become much easier envision.</p>

<p><strong>Who Could Put Known To Work?</strong><br />This is where I need to work through some of my initial thoughts about Known, and push things to new levels. Known makes sense to me when it comes to reclaiming control over my content, while also giving me a single doorway to create additional channels for syndication and publishing, beyond the Twitter, and Facebook I am already working with. However when it comes to other folks who aren't familiar with reclaim, or POSSE principles, it becomes challenging to explain how it can be put to work.</p>
<p>First, I want to disconnect Known being a tool for individuals. Known can bring together any online channels used by an individual, organization, business, event, or any other entity you can think of, that would possibly have an online presence. What are some of the possibilities for putting Known to work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Businesses</strong> - To manage a centralized social media, blogging, and other online presence for a small to large business.</li>
<li><strong>Churches</strong> - Provide a central place for church groups to manage their online presence, from an interface everyone can use.</li>
<li><strong>Libraries</strong> - Give the local library a single way to control messaging online, and engage with constituents via a single&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Museums</strong> - Perfect for museum collections to manage the communication and messaging around exhibits that have online presence.</li>
<li><strong>Schools</strong> - Known has already made inroads into schools, perfect for overall institutions, as well as departments, classes, or individual projects.</li>
<li><strong>Public Space -</strong> Parks, dog parks, open space, and other public space often have a social media, and messaging presence, where Known can be put to work.</li>
<li><strong>Farmers Market -</strong> A farmers market needs an active presence to stay engage with constituents, and known can be used to control, and centralize messaging.</li>
<li><strong>Neighborhoods</strong> - Bringing it down to the hyper-local level, allowing people to work together and manage the messaging and communication within a neighborhood.</li>
<li><strong>Government</strong> - Providing a common platform for government agencies to work together on projects, as well as manage digital strategies for any size of agency.</li>
<li><strong>Group Projects </strong>- I can think of a number of other project scenarios that have an online presence ranging from open source projects, to public / private sector partnerships that could use Known.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a start, when it comes to the potential uses of Known. I'll keep working on them, and post individual stories that help people see the ways they can put Known to work. I see the platform providing a free, low cost, asw well as a privately hosted solution that individuals and organizations can use to get a handle on their content and digital presence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the toughest part of the Known proposition, is quantifying the endless scenarios of where it can be applied. In my opinion this is the potential, while also a significant challenge for the platform.</p>
<p><strong>How Do I Explain What Known Is?</strong><br />One of the biggest problems with concepts like Reclaim Your Domain, and POSSE is the average Joe or Jane citizen could often care less about these concepts, that is until you find a relevant context, tha is important for them--which is why I'm writing this post. If you are a photographer, you are going to care about your photos more, and think more critically about where and how you publish. If you are a writer, or creative professional, keeping track of your work, ideas, and intellectual exhaust should be important, but for many other people, businesses, and organizations, this is just not relevant or prominent in their existence.</p>
<p>Known is not a social media management tool, even thought it possesses many of the same characteristics. It is more about staying in control of content across all of your digital channels, in an easily extensible way. The trick is to help people see the potential, encourage enough developer to develop plugins, and craft valuable webhooks, so that individuals, businesses, organizations, institutions, and government agencies find it immediately useful. In a regular start-up, the focus would be on the most lucrative targets, like within the enterprise, but I'd like to see Known find an audience within some lucrative circles, as well as in the long tail of use, serving those who can't afford costly solutions, but could be providing a valuable community service.</p>
<p>The trick is going to be helping everyone understand the wide, API driven of potential, to the point where they will pay for a pro service, and help keep the platform thriving. Not everyone is moved by the important reclaim and POSSE concepts, but could really benefit from the easy of use, centralization, and management of their presence across the increasing number of platforms we are publishing to across any number of industries.</p>
<p><strong>Where Would I Pay For Known?</strong><br />I have upgraded my Known account to the pro version. It is important to me that I support them, and I use the tool every day so it is worth me paying for the service. Beyond that I'd be into paying for premium services, the ability to publish links, stories, and other items to specialty channels. Think event or blog syndication, or possibly tapping interesting transformation services that I can apply to my audio notes, podcasts, or other life bits. (translation, transcription, etc)</p>
<p>I also imagine in the future there being premium plugins that I can discover, and add to my Known projects with a push of a button. I'd be happy to pay developers a premium for these bells and whistles, something that Known could definitely take a cut of. Once I get more comfortable with plugin development, and the potential for API driven channels, I'm sure I'll have more ideas about areas I'd cough up cash for, within the Known ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>POSSE In Addition To Reciprocity</strong><br />I am increasingly using <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, as what I call a reciprocity service. I use it to move valuable information between the cloud service I depend on. Countries establish reciprocity agreements for trade, Zapier gives me tools for managing trade between the digital spaces I operate between. Known adds a POSSE layer to my digital operations, where Zapier allows me to move things around, Known allows me to publish once, an syndicate wherever I need to. While I could hand code all of this myself, these services allow me to do it in a simple, extensible way, that saves me a lot of time and resources.</p>
<p><strong>An Open Source Solution</strong><br />In 2015, it is getting increasingly rare for me to adopt a new tool or service, if there isn't an open source aspect to it. Most of the time I end up depending on cloud services instead of the open source edition, but having the option to migrate my own platform, or help deploy customized solutions using open source version is important. In my opinion open source, software as a service, and APIs all work together in creating a winning business model, something Known is taking full advantage of.</p>
<p><strong>The Known Team</strong><br />Another important factor in all of this for me, is the Known team. I believe in&nbsp;Ben Werdmuller and Erin Jo Richey, the Known founders. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/07/22/reclaim-your-domain-hackathon/">I've spent enough time with both of them at the Reclaim Your Domain events we have organized to get to know them</a>&nbsp;well. They don't just have the skills, they have the vision, and a healthy view of how the Internet should work.&nbsp;Ben believes that technology is an empowering force that makes the world better by leveling playing fields, informing citizens, and connecting us all, and with a background in cognitive science, Erin loves creating engaging, human-centric software within the context of sustainable businesses. #win #win</p>
<p><strong>The Known Mission</strong><br />Known is a start-up, but it has a larger mission, to help empower people through simple, standards-based, open source software, which also has free, and low cost cloud services for those without the resources to deploy all of it on their own. This type of approach to software is the future in my opinion. It is not just the open source software, in conjunction with a free and paid cloud model, it is also the embracing of APis as a distribution channel--this API-centric focus is why I believe in Known.</p>
<p><strong>Making Sure We can Have Simple, Powerful API Driven Tools Like Known</strong><br />I am writing this post, first to help me better understand, and articulate the potential of Known. I've been using for over a month now, and it is proving to be very useful in managing the daily syndication of content across my primary channels. I'm working to better understand the potential for webhooks and plugins, and extend it to better meet my own operational needs. Along the way I want to better understand how to on-board other people with the concept, whether they are into the reclaim or POSSE concepts, or just looking to get a better handle on the their social media.</p>
<p>Along the way I am going to tell stories about how I am using Known, in hopes of helping people learn how they can put it to work as well. Services like Known, are good for the API industry, and I want to see it succeed, so in addition to helping the platform find new users, I also want to help encourage the development of API driven plugins, and webhooks that can be employed via Known. I can see Known becoming an essential building block like I've identified Zapier as, I think it could become that important for API providers to consider offering a plugin for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also important for me to help Known find success using its simple, pro business model, and potentially find future revenue opportunities, that help keep the lights on, but also don't change the platform in ways that take it down the wrong path. I trust Ben and Erin to make the right technological, and business decisions, what worries me is that people won't see the potential, and the importance of API, standards driven tools like Known, that help us take control of our digital personas. It often seems in this crazy tech driven world that the best products don't always win, and intend to ensure this doesn't happen to Known.</p>
<p>We need more tools like known that help empower everyone to own the valuable exhaust that they produce online daily, not ceding control to the endless waves of exploitative platforms and applications that seem to step up and try to own people's valuable life bits. Look for more stories about Known from me, as I continue to extend its functionality to help me maintain my POSSE stance when it comes to my digital presence.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gears.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I get a number of folks contacting me about their API ideas, and email or call me, looking to schedule a meeting or briefing to discuss the API ideas. This is something I always reply with a request for existing links to the portal, blog, Twitter, and Github accounts of those involved. Even when companies are doing something interesting, I prefer to approach it like any random Joe or Jane would, from the public portal, with very little information up-front. Your overall approach to API, the value it delivers, and ease of integration should speak for itself, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I am sure there are plenty of companies still who would prefer a briefing, meeting, call, or other personal touch, sales or pitch like engagement, but increasingly in an API driven world, a self-service, pull approach is preferred. A well done API shouldn't have to rely only on traditional marketing. I'm not saying that you shouldn't have these mechanims in place, but by pushing this approach on media, developers, and other potential consumers, you are doing yourself a disservice in many situations--going backwards, not forwards.</p>
<p>There is also another group of people who contact me, who really don't have a thing yet. They are just looking for validation, and potentially stimulate discussions that will get them more attention from would be investors. As with the previous group, I think the "just do it" approach works best. You are going to stimulate much more meaningful discussions amongst investors if you are actually doing something, and generating real buzz amongst developers. Additionally you never know, you may be able to bootstrap and make it happen, without attracting major investment.</p>
<p>I know many of you traditional busines folks are used to a push approach to getting your business out there, but when you are looking to make inroads in the API economy, your majority investment should be about creating a platform that people can visit, and pull the value you generate into their worlds, via a self-service model. Right behind the portal, you should have robust marketing, sales, and other outreach mechanisms, but your primary outreach approach should be just about doing what you preach, not scheduling calls to discuss and convince someone of what you do.</p>
<p>For me when someone insists on jumping on a call to discuss their API, is an immediate filter of bad ideas. If someone is just talking, and not showing, more often than not, there isn't anything really there. If you have to defend or hide your idea, it probably shouldn't be out there anyways.</p>

<p>I have been slowly <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/04/07/including-postman-collections-in-my-apisjson-files/">adding Postman Collections to many of the APIs indexes</a>&nbsp;for my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">new master stack</a>. I index each API using an APIs.json file, as well as provide a master APIs.json which brings together all of the APIs, into the single portal I've published to Github. Within some of the APIs, you will see a Postman icon, allowing you to easily import the API definition into postman, directly from each APIs landing page.</p>
<p>When <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/04/07/including-postman-collections-in-my-apisjson-files/">I first published that I was publishing these Postman collections on my Alpha API Evangelist blog</a>, someone from the <a href="https://api.justgiving.com/docs">donation API platform Just Giving</a> said they also <a href="https://github.com/JustGiving/JustGiving.Api.Tools.Postman">prepare Postman collections for their developers, and publish them to Github</a> for their API consumers:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>At JustGiving we give our API consumers a set of collections to import to make their jobs even easier, we also use the "Environments" feature to substitute different values depending on whether you're using our Sandbox or Production environment - it's a real time saver and also helps when supporting our API consumers.</em></p>
<p>I feel pretty strongly that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/13/postman-collections-as-unit-of-measurement-for-transactions-in-the-api-economy/">Postman is a measurable unit for transactions in the API economy</a>, and I feel it goes a long way in helping API consumers onboard with each new API. As a developer, if I can import a Postman Collections into my client, within just a couple clicks, and be up and running with an API--I am going to be a much happier camper, and be that much closer to integration.</p>
<p>I'm considering adding Postman collections as a building block under API on-boarding, and encourage API providers to follow JustGivings lead. Postman Collections is kind of the new API explorer, allowing developers to quickly test drive an API they are going to integrate with. With my own platform, I'm also going to play with publishing Postman Collections, complete with API keys that I refresh regularly, allowing immediate, but limited access my APIs, for anyone who stumble across them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like Swagger, Postman is increasingly a machine readable definition that API proviers should be producing, alongside Swagger and API Blueprint for the entire API surface area, and APIs.json for indexing of all API operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/twitter-access.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have had Steve Willmotts of 3Scale's response to the announcement that Twitter was cutting off firehose access for over a week now, and bringing the higher level access completely in house via their Gnip acquisition. You can read the response from Gnip via their blog post&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.gnip.com/twitter-data-ecosystem/">Working Directly With the Twitter Data Ecosystem</a>, and from DataSift in their&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.datasift.com/2015/04/13/twitter-datasift-gap/">The Twitter/Gnip Gap: Data Licensing vs Data Processing</a>. Steve and I are in agreement with the points made via his <a href="http://www.3scale.net/2015/04/losing-innovation-twitters-firehose-mistake/">How Not to be a Platform: Twitter&rsquo;s Firehose Mistake</a> post. Where I really struggled with over the last week, in producing a official response, was after responding <a href="https://medium.com/politics-of-apis/how-to-be-a-platform-making-tough-partnership-choices-b9cd473821de">How To Be A Platform: Making Tough Partnership Choices</a>, from my friend Tyler Singletary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You see, I agree with everything Tyler pointed as well. He's right. Twitter has probably made the right decision for Twitter, and based upon their goals and understanding of the Twitter API ecosystem, did exactly what should be prescribed. I have lots of opinions around the Twitter ecosystem, and how&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">Twitter Continues to Restrict Access to Our Tweets</a>. However, when I step back, and put on my API operations hat, everything Tyler points out, is valid in my opinion. Twitter gets to decide who has access, and in respect to their goals, chooseing the Gnip offering over the DataSift offering makes sense. It's all about the winning solution, and where the ROI is when it comes platform operations? Life is good when you are on the winning team. However #winning != #good, and #winning != best outcome. I also guess, that #open != good, and #open != best outcome either. There are no absolutes in API land--sorry.</p>
<p>Where Tyler stance really begin to lose its shine for me, is when you zoom out. You see Tyler, you are on the winning team. You have access to the firehose, and you operate squarely within in the #winning conversation (I know you don't have direct firehose, and rely on Gnip). Those of who aren't, the conversation looks very different. Let's take a look at the Gnip vs. Datasift product comparison you provide, but from my stance.</p>
<p>After two phone calls with Gnip sales team, they realized I didn't have the requisite $45K to move forward, not worthy of continuing to talk to this one. All I'm left with is Twitter REST and Streaming API, and DataSift. Gnip isn't even on the menu, isn't even an option in my world. So only the players who can afford to be at the table, get to play--kind of sounds like a familiar story to me. Where have I heard this before? Oh in every industry, throughout history. This isn't the API promise I've been hearing! ;-)</p>
<p>I remember in 2007 and 2008 when Twitter was built on these same principles. Only people with the big money could step up and play on the platform. Oh wait no! It was the other way, the people with money didn't give shit about Twitter, and only us small fish were playing on the platform. We were building widgets, Wordpress plugins, developing meaningful analytics, mobile apps, and Twitter encouraged it all. Prove what you are building on the public API, and when you are ready, we'll get rid of any rate limits, or even give you the firehose-just ask us, we'll give you the access you need--the firehose rhetoric was much different 5 years ago:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2010/enabling-rush-innovation">Full investment in this ecosystem of innovation, means all our partners should have access to the same volume of data, regardless of company size. More than fifty thousand interesting applications are currently using our freely available, rate-limited platform offerings. With access to the full Firehose of data, it is possible to move far beyond the Twitter experiences we know today. In fact, we&rsquo;re pretty sure that some amazing innovation is possible.</a>&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The rush of innovation did happen, but does anyone have access to the same volume of data regarless of company size in 2015? Does the argument that Tyler lays out today, apply in a 2007 or 2010 Twitter ecosystem? How does this line of thinging impact the new startups who are trying to get API developers to come out to use their ecosystems, now, when the big money players don't care about them? Sure things have changed, things have evolved, but I just don't buy the argument that the better product (Gnip) won out over the other product (DataSift). In the neatly package and positioned arguement sure, it makes sense, but if you zoom out, it just doesn't hold weight, now or then. Things have changed for Twitter, but things haven't changed for new startups who are building platforms--they are still depending on early adopters to build on their platform and turn them into a success story, and attact VCS and users.</p>
<p>This is what leaves many of us so disgruntled, its not Twitter making the hard decisions around platform operations. It is their abrasive stance towards those of us who are not in the club, and their lack of communication about the ecosystem, and their sharecropping, and poaching of the best of ideas along along the way, and changing the tune slowly over time. Honestly, I feel like they've done a good job in correcting much earlier bad behavior recently, with their overall partner program, API operations, and evangelism, but their whole firehose position is lacking the bigger ecosystem vision--it is just self centered. Twitter exploited the community when they could, they hand picked a group of partners (<a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/07/12/the-twitter-firehose/">Gnip, DataSift, DataMinr, Mass Relevance, and many more</a>) to serve this need when they didn't have time or resources to do it on their own, and now that they see that there more dumbass enteprise peopleare willing to pay Gnip prices for our data, over people building on the long tail, I respect the whole thing even less--to the point where I almost have stopped giving a shit, and begun moving on.</p>
<p>Steve is right, Tyler is right, and sure Twitter is right. You might even be able to build an argument that Twitter doesn't owe the long tail of ecosystem developer anything for helping make Twitter what is, which would be a tough argument in my opinion, but you can't argue that Twitter doesn't owes a certain amount of responsibility to end-users to keep platform operations real. This means not making firehose access something only the IBM, Intel's, Oracle's, and other big $$ companies of the world can afford to build (at scale) on Twitter. Sure the rest of us can still build on the public REST and streaming API, but what then? Why would we build on the platform if we reach the 100K token limit, we have no guarantees for the future--that is unless we are in the good ol boy club, and don't have anything to worry about.</p>
<p>I guess in the end, this is all about access (pun intended). Like with many other areas of the world, if you are lucky enough to have a priveleged position, which I'm not just pointing out the Klout / Twitter releationship. I'm also talking about the other cozy VC relationships I've witnessed companies enjoy with Twitter, versus the companies who I've seen that do not enjoy such priveleged access. The conversation cannot just be about he merits of Twitters decision, and the performance of Gnip and DataSift, without including the bigger ecosystem picture. Making the hard API ecosystem decision argument is only valid, if they take into consideration all of the macro issues that truly impact a platform, not just those of the platform owners and its most cherished partners and investors have. While I think Twitter and its investors feel like they own Twitter, us developers, and power users who have been on the platform since early days, also feel like we have a certain amount of ownership too--an ownership Twitter has shown they don't respect.</p>
<p>Twitter definitely holds the cards at the moment, but eventually as more of us power user realize we are just fine without a Twitter presence, Twitter will face becoming the NBC of social media--still relevant, but are you still truly relevant? Not forever.</p>

        <p><a href="http://open-platform.theguardian.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/the-guardian-open-platform.jpeg" alt="" width="290" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The most important stories told across the API space, the ones that have the biggest impact on API providers, and ultimately API consumers, are the stories that come out of the trenches of the API operations at the leading public API providers. This is why 3Scale and API Evangelist started APIStrat, and what the audiences over the last 3 years of operating APIDays and APIStrat have consistently requested--more stories from the trenches.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we've asked S&eacute;bastien Cevey (<a href="https://twitter.com/theefer">@theefer</a>) of The Guardian to come to <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe 2015</a>, and share a story from API operations at the worlds leading media API provider. S&eacute;bastien wanted to share their view of what Hypermedia APIs are, by comparing them to a classical RPC architecture and ad-hoc "JSON APIs". He will also cover key benefits of using Hypermedia APIs (cacheability, discoverability, evolveability/extensibility, simplicity, interactive nature), presented in the context of real-world examples and the different constraints of REST (HTTP, URIs, verbs, hypermedia controls like links and forms).</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/theefer"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/sebastien-sevey-the-guardian.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>What I like about S&eacute;bastien viepoint, is 1) he works at one of the most progressive media outlets in the world, where he is actually putting APIs to work, and 2) his pragmatic approach. S&eacute;bastien will talk about what hypermedia APIs are, anchoring his lessons in real-world examples from Guardian operations, but he will also discuss the caveats of this API style, acknowledging the realities of API operations. There are no perfect solutions, but technologists like S&eacute;bastien&nbsp;are pushing the discipline of API design forward, while also balancing with the real-world reality that exists in their workplaces.</p>
<p>The keynote from S&eacute;bastien Cevey (@theefer) of The Guardian, <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/schedule/">will kick off the first day of @APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe 2015</a>, so <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/#tile_registration">make sure you are registered today</a>, so you don't get locked out when we sell out (which we are very close). If you are looking to learn more about hypermedia APIs, I recommend starting with S&eacute;bastien's keynote, but also make sure and join us Saturday morning for the entire hypermedia API session, where you can learn more about this fast growing API design consideration, from those pushing the conversation forward, and putting hypermedia APIs to work in the real world.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://open-platform.theguardian.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/the-guardian-open-platform.jpeg" alt="" width="290" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The most important stories told across the API space, the ones that have the biggest impact on API providers, and ultimately API consumers, are the stories that come out of the trenches of the API operations at the leading public API providers. This is why 3Scale and API Evangelist started APIStrat, and what the audiences over the last 3 years of operating APIDays and APIStrat have consistently requested--more stories from the trenches.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we've asked S&eacute;bastien Cevey (<a href="https://twitter.com/theefer">@theefer</a>) of The Guardian to come to <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe 2015</a>, and share a story from API operations at the worlds leading media API provider. S&eacute;bastien wanted to share their view of what Hypermedia APIs are, by comparing them to a classical RPC architecture and ad-hoc "JSON APIs". He will also cover key benefits of using Hypermedia APIs (cacheability, discoverability, evolveability/extensibility, simplicity, interactive nature), presented in the context of real-world examples and the different constraints of REST (HTTP, URIs, verbs, hypermedia controls like links and forms).</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/theefer"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/sebastien-sevey-the-guardian.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>What I like about S&eacute;bastien viepoint, is 1) he works at one of the most progressive media outlets in the world, where he is actually putting APIs to work, and 2) his pragmatic approach. S&eacute;bastien will talk about what hypermedia APIs are, anchoring his lessons in real-world examples from Guardian operations, but he will also discuss the caveats of this API style, acknowledging the realities of API operations. There are no perfect solutions, but technologists like S&eacute;bastien&nbsp;are pushing the discipline of API design forward, while also balancing with the real-world reality that exists in their workplaces.</p>
<p>The keynote from S&eacute;bastien Cevey (@theefer) of The Guardian, <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/schedule/">will kick off the first day of @APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe 2015</a>, so <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/#tile_registration">make sure you are registered today</a>, so you don't get locked out when we sell out (which we are very close). If you are looking to learn more about hypermedia APIs, I recommend starting with S&eacute;bastien's keynote, but also make sure and join us Saturday morning for the entire hypermedia API session, where you can learn more about this fast growing API design consideration, from those pushing the conversation forward, and putting hypermedia APIs to work in the real world.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing you all in Berlin, next week!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/on-apis-and-microservices/">On APIs and Microservices</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-idea-struggle.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've been monitoring an emerging slice of the API, that has been dubbed "microservices" for some time now, and you've even heard me explore its use, <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/02/25/aspiring-to-be-a-network-of-loosely-coupled-gitnodes-over-being-an-organization-of-github-repos/">when describing my architectural approach to redesigning more core API stack for my internal systems</a>. I&rsquo;m slowly redesigning my internal API stack, keeping them as small as possible, throughout all aspects of operations, deploying each endpoint in a single dockerized container, that contains the OS, database, web server and all server side API code. I'm also using Github, in conjunction with <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/01/30/what-is-missing-on-my-microservices-using-apisjson/">APIs.json to assist me in my orchestration</a>, throughout every aspect of these APIs lifecycle from design to testing&mdash;all a new approach for me when managing my APIs.</p>
<p>Is defining my APIs in this way, so that the definition is much more than just the actual API endpoints, but also include the entire backend, and lifecycle workflow Microservices? Fuck if I know. One thing I do know, is I've had enough conversations with folks who are doing microservices, resulting in me saying&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/17/more-pondering-on-my-own-microservice-definition/">several times that the micro services definition is something very personal</a>. Something which the first 10 times I said , sounded very positive, but after experiencing multiple people telling me what I'm doing isn't microservices, I can tell the term definitely will continue to be very personal&mdash;very much in the same way conversations around REST or Hypermedia has gotten personal on forums, and HN threads.</p>
<p>You know what this tells me about microservices? Is it is more about power, control and influence, everything from enterprise architects stating their endorsement of the concept, down to the individual architects, who love to make sure you know that the way you are doing it, is WRONG! I don't think there is a single definition of "microservice", and much like REST, I think we'll hear plenty of &ldquo;right&rdquo; definitions, by the enterprise justifying what they are doing, and those who are selling something to the enterprise. Is there anything wrong with this? Nope. Just not my style, not my game, and has shown me over the couple months how the concept is not a fit for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to stick in the realm of API. It is a completely bullshit term, that means everything, but you know what? Somehow it escaped the IT, architect, and vendor ownership that SOA and now microservices possesses. For me APIs have long been more than just the tech, it is also about the business and politics of any platform implementation, so why can&rsquo;t it contain my architecture styles as well? So from here forward I will be closely paying attention to microservices conversations, but you won&rsquo;t hear me use the word, as I&rsquo;m more comfortable in API land, and what it has come to mean to the wider public&mdash;I just don&rsquo;t give a shit about what the enterprise adopts, or doesn't.</p>
<p>Microservices will reflect the power and control of the entities behind them, unlike APIs, which also possesses that characteristic, but also quickly shifts the conversation to be more about the innovation and opportunity that developers bring to the table, and the end-users who put that to use. Let&rsquo;s make sure as we do not get caught up in the architectural discussions behind the technical curtain, and that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">we remember why all of this API stuff is working</a>. Let's not get caught up in all the value being just about our architectural styles, and re-live a classic IT tale, ignoring that the real value is what people actually do with our services.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/my-minimum-viable-api-footprint-definition/">My Minimum Viable API Footprint Definition</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-footprint.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>This is something I talk about often, but it has been a while since I&rsquo;ve done a story dedicated to it, so I wanted to make sure and take a fresh look at what I&rsquo;d consider to be a minimum viable footprint for any API&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care if it is public or not. This definition has grown out of five years of monitoring the approach taken by leading API providers, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/2015/02/08/a-minimum-viable-apisjson-file-for-your-apis/">is also baked into what I&rsquo;d consider to be a minimum viable APIs.json definition</a>&mdash;which provides an important index for API operations.</p>
<p>What do I want to see when I visit a developer area? More importantly, what does your average developer, or API consumer need when they land on your API portal? Let&rsquo;s look at the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Portal -</strong> A clean, easily accessible, prominently place portal landing page. This shouldn&rsquo;t be buried with your help section, it should be located at developer.[yourdomain].com. '</li>
<li><strong>Description -</strong> As soon as developers land, they need a simple, concise explanation of what an API does. Actually describe what the API does, not just that it provides programmatic access to your products and services. </li>
<li><strong>Getting Started -</strong> Give everyone, even non-developers as place to start, helping us understand what is needed to get started with API integration, from signing up for an account to where do I find support.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation -</strong> Deliver, simple, clean, and up to date documentation, preferably of the interactive kind with a Swagger or API Blueprint behind.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication -</strong> Help developers understand authentication. There are a handful of common approaches from BasicAuth, and API keys, to oAuth--provide a simple overview of how authentication is handled.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Registration -</strong> How do I sign up? Give me a link to a self-service account signup, and make it as easy for me to create my new account, and go from idea to live integration as fast as possible&mdash;don&rsquo;t make me wait for initial approval, that can come later.</li>
<li><strong>Code -</strong> Provide consumers with code, whether they are samples, libraries, or full blown Software Development Kits (SDKs) and Platform Development Kits (PDK). Make sure as many possible languages are provided, not just the languages you use.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Support -</strong> Give API consumers a way to reach you via email, ticketing system, chat, or good ol fashioned phone.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Support -</strong> Provide self service support options via FAQ, Knowledgbases, Forums and other proven ways developers can find the answers they need, when they need.</li>
<li><strong>Communication -</strong> Setup the proper communication channels like a blog and PR section, as well as a healthy social presence on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, or other places your audience already exists.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing -</strong> Even if an API is free, provide an overview of how the platform makes it money, and generates value &mdash; enough to keep it up and running, so I know, as an API consumer I can depend on. Let me know all pricing levels, and provide insight into other partner opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limits -</strong> Provide a clear overview of how the platform is rate limited, even if they are to protect service availability, let consumers know what to expect.</li>
<li><strong>Roadmap -</strong> Give consumers a look at what is coming in the future, keeping it as a simple, forecast of the short and long term future of an API.</li>
<li><strong>Change Log -</strong> Provide us consumers with a list of all changes that have been made to platform operations, don&rsquo;t limit to just API changes, and include significant roadmap milestones that have been reached.</li>
<li><strong>Status - </strong>Offer a real-time status dashboard of the platform, with a history view of platform status, that consumers can use as a decision making tool, as well as get current platform status.</li>
<li><strong>Github -</strong> Use Github for all aspects of your API platform operations from hosting code, to providing support via issues, to actually hosting your entire developer portal on Github Pages. </li>
<li><strong>Terms of Service -</strong> Provide, easy to find, and understand terms of service for platform operations, helping API consumers understand what they are in for.</li>
<li><strong>APIs.json - </strong>A machine readable index of any API driven platform, providing a single place to find not just the API endpoints, but also all of the essential building blocks of API operations listed above.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is my shortlist, of common building blocks that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every API platform should have</span>. Part of the reason I&rsquo;m publishing this, is to provide a fresh look at what I&rsquo;d consider to be the minimum viable footprint, but <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">I&rsquo;m also working to get my own API portal for my new master API stack up to snuff</a>, meeting my own criteria. Without a checklist, I forget what some of the essential building blocks are&mdash;you know the cobbler's kids have the worst shoes and all.</p>
<p>After I&rsquo;m done making sure my own API portal meets this criteria, something I can programmatically measure when done, via the APIs.json file, I will provide a self-service evaluation tool that anyone can use to measure whether or not their own portal meets my minimum viable API footprint definition.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.fiberlocator.com/fiberlocator-api/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/fiberlocator-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Somewhere during my weekly monitoring I found the <a href="http://www.fiberlocator.com/fiberlocator-api/">Fiber Locator API</a>, which like all APIs, especially the ones that ask me to &ldquo;request access&rdquo;, I signed up for the service.  Understanding where telecommunications companies have laid fiber optic cable, for me, equals a potentially valuable API resource&mdash;sure I would consider integrating these resources into my applications, and systems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never a big fan of APIs, who make you request access vs self-service registration, but if the API has value, I jump through hoops, so I can can better understand what an API does, which according to the Fiber Locator site:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>FiberLocator offers an application programming interface that gives you access to our database of over 265+ carriers, over 272,000 carrier lit buildings locations and 3,000+ data centers. We created our API services so that client companies can augment their own systems and analyses with our unique data sets.</em></p>
<p>I filled out the form, providing my name, email, phone and company name, the provided the additional details:<em> I am the API Evangelist, and I&rsquo;d like to write a story about the Fiber Locator API</em>. Something I do a lot. Within 24 hours I received:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/fiber-api-2.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></p>
<p>Then I got this:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/fiber-api-1.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></p>
<p>Both of these emails I replied with the same additional details I included with my request for API access. I received a third solicitation, but felt it didn't add any value to the conversation. From what I can tell, the Fiber Locator API is simply a lead generation form, which routes to sales people&mdash;I see no evidence of an API.</p>
<p>Maybe there is something really there, if there is, this is not how you on-board people. I may just be writing a story about the API, which you should probably encourage, but that is just me, but if you really want developers to integrate fiber location into their applications and internal systems, you should probably let us kick the tires, see what the service is all about.</p>
<p>Modern APIs are not a lead generation tool, and API evangelism does not equal sales. If I cannot understand what your API platform offers, sign up to get at least a taste of that value, I&rsquo;m moving on. I&rsquo;ll keep the Fiber Locator API in my database, but I will not be tuning into what they are up to, because by my definition, they don&rsquo;t fit the model of a modern API platform.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2015</span>
        <p>APIs are very much a virtual concept, something that is very abstract, often difficult to explain, and is something that very much lives in the online world. Spending much of my daily life in this world, I&rsquo;m always excited to come across APIs that bridge this digital world, with our existing physical worlds.</p>
<p>At first read, you might think I&rsquo;m talking about the recent growth of Internet of Things APIs, that are connecting physical devices like our thermostats and smoke alarms, to our mobile devices, using APIs. This is part of it, but for this post I&rsquo;m referencing APIs that don&rsquo;t just connect to objects in our physical world, but they actually bind to existing experiences, processes, and other aspects of our personal and professional worlds.</p>
<p>The Link Creation Studio from HP, is this. Using the web interface, or the API, you can create QR codes, and images with digital watermarks, which can be printed, then any user with a mobile device can snap a picture, which then triggers an action, that then takes the user to a specific location online--providing a bridge from a printed object in our physical world, to an online extension of that object.</p>
<p>This bridge comes with the ability to manage the action that is embedded in print, and the resulting online link destination. You can print the QR code, and digital watermarks, and over time see analytics for each user that traverses the bridge, from print to web page. Link Creation Studio users can also manage this experience, and change it over time to get the resulting experience, that both the publisher, and users desire.</p>
<p>The Link Creation Studio is a simple, but very powerful tool for building bridges between our physical and online worlds. The fact that it has an API is extremely significant, allowing these bridges to be built in real-time, from any system, whether that is a classic business print situation like business cards and product brochures, or something more ad-hoc like a individual person printing flyers, and hanging on telephone poles in their neighborhood, for a party that weekend.</p>
<p>This type of API implementation is more significant to me than just an API that connects, a single device to my mobile phone. This type of API can be used in a million different business, and personal scenarios, resulting in some potentially very interesting, and impactful implementations. These are the APIs that fascinate me, and hold the most potential for making big change in my opinion.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclosure: </strong>This story came out of a paid review I did of the HP Link Creation Studio, but as anyone who has paid me to do a review knows, a paid review does not equal a good review, let alone extra stories. These were actual thoughts I had while conducting the review, that I wanted to share once done.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-section-508.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>This is a topic I&rsquo;ve had an increasing number of conversation with folks about in the last couple months, and a friend of mine Tweeted in response to today, resulting in this lovely rant. This is about two very separate problems, in which the solutions are what I'd consider significantly overlapped. I&rsquo;m talking about the need to make sure the valuable metadata, as well as underlying resources made available via an API is accessible to search engines, while also making sure the it is all <a href="http://www.section508.gov/section508-laws">Section 508 compliant</a>, providing critical access to people with disabilities.</p>
<p>In response to my recent post, on "Why The New API Blueprint Sharing Button From Apiary Is So Important&rdquo;, said:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>I'm heavy user of <a href="https://twitter.com/apiaryio">@apiaryio</a> but disappointed with discoverability features of the product. Google just ignores them. <a href="https://t.co/w0hcGmpgMd">https://t.co/w0hcGmpgMd</a></p>
&mdash; Kristopher Kleva (@klevland) <a href="https://twitter.com/klevland/status/586289568632168449">April 9, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>First, this is another reason why the API Blueprint being more open is important, anyone can now come along and not just build an SEO API documentation solution, they can get access to Apiary.io users who desire such a solution. Ok, that might seem bad for Apiary, but in situations that Apiary is not concerned with, this allows the community to step up and serve the long tail, and if it is something that concerns Apiary, it lights the fire under their ass to consider adding to the road map (sorry Jakub &amp; Z, I know I"m a pain ;-).</p>
<p>Second, it allows the community to step up and serve what I'd consider the critical long tail&mdash;like Section 508. In our rush to deliver the latest in technological innovations, we often forget about significant portions of our society who, well, aren&rsquo;t like us. How many leading apps and platforms that you use are Section 508 compliant? I guarantee almost all API tooling is not&mdash;something we need to address now, and is a&nbsp;<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/us-government-apis/508/us-government-apis/dX34Bn5dcWQ/-Avg7rEbaNkJ">topic where discussion is currently happening the federal government circles</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a big fan of Swagger UI, and Apiary, and what they have done for API design, deployment, management, discovery, and evangelism, but we need to keep working on the next generation of UI, and UX that is easily indexed, and works well with assistive technologies. Ok, at this point the hypermedia folks want to kick my ass--bring it! ;-) Kidding. What I am talking about should happen in conjunction with well designed, hypermedia fueled clients, not instead--both camps should be addressing making sure all clients or SEO and 508 friendly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll close with a note on the opportunity here. There is huge potential to develop an open source API UI component that can use Swagger and API Blueprint as the core definition, implementing a more SEO and 508 compatible experience, something akin to <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">Slate from Trippit</a>. I&rsquo;m thinking rather than a pull technology like Swagger UI does with its JS interface pulled from a Swagger definition, and I&rsquo;m guessing Apiary does a similar pull from API Blueprint docs?? A more of an HTML, CSS push or publish of functional, static API documentation, that uses JavaScript and APIs to operate&mdash;just some raw thoughts on how to take next steps, its now up to you.</p>
<p>I guarantee if you made an open source set of tools to support this, you'd get the attention of government at all levels, around the world, something that would open up significant other opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was just doing on of my regular check-ins with Pratap Ranade (<a href="https://twitter.com/pratapranade">@pratapranade</a>), the CEO of <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono</a>. We try to make time to catchup on what each other are up to, and find where we can work together to incite API evolution. Pratap sees the space like I do, that APIs are more than tech, possessing huge potential when it comes to empowering folks to make change within their companies, organizations, institutions, government agencies, and the wider industries and countries they exist in.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t go into too much detail about the projects we are working on until they are ready, but I just spend over an hour talking through some pretty interesting use cases that have occurred via Kimono Labs, in which Kimono users are scraping data and content from existing websites, and crafting some pretty interesting APIs. I&rsquo;m not just talking about the fun things like <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/marchmadness/explorer">March Madness</a> or <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/worldcup/explorer">World Cup</a> going on over at Kimono, I&rsquo;m talking about influencing elections, addressing disaster recovery issues, and providing timely data that can influence how financial markets are working (or not).</p>
<p>The best part about these stories, is the work is being done, in many cases by people who don't have traditional programming skills, they are more hackers who have identified a problem, and <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">used Kimono to scrape the data, and generate simple APIs</a>, that help provide a new way of delivering API-driven solutions to the problem being targeted. Pratap said they are quickly becoming a big data company as well as a structured data API solution, because of the number of folks stepping up to address the long tail of data.</p>
<p>I just wanted to provide a taste of what we are working on. I&rsquo;m always left pumped up about potential of APIs, after hearing what Kimono is up to. If you want a taste of some of the stories I'm talking about, check out the <a href="http://blog.kimonolabs.com/">Kimono blog</a>.</p>

<p>This is another story that came to mind while listening to the last episode of <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>. As John and Steve were talking about the API definition format Swagger switching from Reverb to SmartBear (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/30/quantifying-the-community-around-the-swagger-api-specification/">thanks for shout-out about my Swagger post</a>), they were discussing how Microsoft is using Swagger as part of platform operations, and made sure and reminded us listeners that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all this has been done before</span></strong>. Bringing up a never-ending theme &nbsp;in the world of APIs, that we just can't seem to shake loose.</p>
<p>When people bring this up, what do they mean? Yes, modern API definitions like Swagger, are very much like earlier incarnations of WSDL and WADL. Ok. What now?</p>
<ul>
<li>We shouldn&rsquo;t do it? It won&rsquo;t work? Don&rsquo;t even bother with Swagger?</li>
<li>We should learn from history, and earlier efforts, and make sure we don't same mistakes?</li>
<li>We should be scared of Swagger, and run for the hills, hide in a bunker?</li>
<li>We should all switch back to SOAP and use WSDL?</li>
<li>You just like to tell me I'm wrong, and has nothing to do with technology?</li>
</ul>
<p>Why I bring this up, is because more often than not, most of these conversation lean towards the first response &mdash; don&rsquo;t even bother, except you don&rsquo;t really know because people who state &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve already done this&rdquo;, often leave it open ended, offering no constructive criticism. Some even close it with, this is nothing new! Ok, so what then? How does that impact my decision making, now.</p>
<p>I guess, for me, I step back at look at how this applies to the rest of my world. Do we do this with all other trends in our lives? We already did short skirts, why do we gotta do them again? I heard on NPR the other day that open office plan was invented by the Germans in the 1950s, and proven in-effective by the 1970s, and here in this decade we are doing again. Don&rsquo;t you know we&rsquo;ve already done that?  C&rsquo;mon. Sheesh. Aren't there endless things we've already done in the past that didn't work, and we try them again in a different context, with potentially different results?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, the argument holds no weight for me. So what if we&rsquo;ve already done this, or it is nothing new. I had a shitload of WSDLs laying around in 2003, and now in 2015 I have a butt-load of Swagger laying around--in the end I'm optimistic for more meaningful tooling to emerge. Tell me some practical tip that was applied back in the good ol SOA days that I can use today, don&rsquo;t tear down what I do today. If Swagger isn&rsquo;t for you, cool, tell me what is. Tell me how you are solving defining your APIs, mocking servers, collaborating and iterating around the API designs in your world, how you generate server side code, or client side code, and setup your testing, monitoring, and QA, or maybe providing a discovery service, visualization, and IDE tools &mdash; the fact that we&rsquo;ve already done this, means nothing. We&rsquo;ve already done a lot of things.</p>
<p><em>P.S. I really wish I could import my shitload of Swagger 2.0 specs I having laying around in Runscope, but I have to generate Swagger 1.2, import into Postman, generate post man collections, and then import into my Runscope account. Sheesh! ;-)</em></p>

<p>Yay! Another story generated by listening to <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather</a>&nbsp;(blame John and Steve). I do enjoy sharing my random thoughts while listening to those two. This one is around the SDK discussion during the latest episode, but as they noted, they&rsquo;ve talked about SDKs a lot in the past. This particular reference was again, during the their discussion about Microsoft using Swagger to generate code&mdash;a topic which brought up the usual grumbles from John about SDKs. He loves to hate on SDKs, obviously suffering from severe SDK PTSD.</p>
<p>I agree with his feelings about SDKs, they are well founded, but auto-generating code from Swagger doesn&rsquo;t always involve with the generation of full-blown SDKs. I save a huge amount of time, auto-generating different types of code and scripts from Swagger, which I further clean up and make work for my specific needs. My experience with generating code from Swagger, is more about saving time, than it is about producing production ready SDKs.</p>
<p>Maybe my development world is unique, but I find I still have to get my hands dirty, even when I generate server or client side code using Swagger, requiring me to still play with HTTP and understand response / request details. I get what John is saying, and he is right. I'm increasingly frustrated by companies producing platforms that are more SDK than API, something IoT engineers excel at.</p>
<p>I just wanted to point out there are many layers to the discussion, and that there are no perfect solutions when auto-generating code from API definitions, but it can sure save time in both API deployment, as well as API consumption, and unlike SDKs I still understand the inner working of my apps, integrations, and the APIs they are depending on.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-skull-crossbones.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had one of my followers ask me if there as a &ldquo;gold standard for API deprecation policies&rdquo; out there. I&rsquo;d say that deprecation policies are a little different than some of the other legal building blocks of an API, where the legal is a small portion of it, with the majority really being all about communication.</p>
<p>To answer the question, I recommended Google. Not cause their deprecation policy itself is all the great, it is just because their overall approach to API deprecation is pretty robust&mdash;something I&rsquo;m sure is derived from their experience so far. (wink wink)</p>
<p>API deprecation at Google starts with some pretty clearly stated policies, but goes much further with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/terms">Deprecation Policy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-publishers/docs/deprecation">Deprecation Schedule</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v2/data-deprecation">Data Deprecation Details</a></li>
<li><a href="http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2014/12/announcing-deprecation-of-google-earth.html">Blog Communication</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of the building blocks that Google employs as part of their approach to API documentation. This post is just result of a 15 minutes of Googling around, to respond to the question. Now that I have written this post, and put the topic of API deprecation back on my radar, the next step is to dive deeper and develop a complete picture of how Google approaches API deprecation, as well as other leading players in the space.</p>
<p>At first take, it appears to me that the legal details of API deprecation that are present in terms of use, or as standalone documents is only the start. The winning examples of API deprecation involve making sure deprecation details are always readily available, regularly communicated, and are comprehensive enough to cover the API, data, and other things that matter to developers and end-users.</p>

<p>If I find a new company during my research, it takes me about a minimum of 15 minutes to lightly profile what they are up, and add to my system, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/06/my-ideal-profile-of-companies-who-are-doing-interesting-things-with-apis/">if I do a full profile</a>, it can take several hours. All of this adds up to a lot of work, time that would be better spent on actually writing stories, hacking on the APIs, and publishing of the longer form research papers on what I&rsquo;m seeing.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, <a href="http://apisjson.org/">each of these APIs would have an APIs.json in the root of their domain</a>, with details about the company and people responsible for API operations, and as much information about each API as possible. With a single click, I could import the entire profile of a company, and its valuable API resources into my monitoring system, ready for publishing to relevant areas of the API Evangelist network, as well as some of my partner sites like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>--the beauty is, so could anyone else. ;-)</p>
<p>If API providers used <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>, I could be connected to their Blog via RSS, their platform Twitter account via the Twitter API, and their Github profile or organization using the Github API. Not only would I have relevant metadata about a company like their name, description, logo, and details about APIs, I would also be connected to a real-time heartbeat of API operations via the platform blog, Twitter, and Github accounts. This is just the start--there are numerous other building blocks you could wire up with an APIs.json file, to keep potential consumers up to speed.</p>
<p>I know it can be hard to se the potential for APIs.json, because there is limiting tooling available currently, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">beyond the open source search engine APIs.io</a>, Even before the next wave of tooling like the internal enterprise search engine, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/23/i-got-swaggered-last-week-and-now-i-am-seeing-api-visualizations/">visualizations</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chefArchitect/apispots">browser plugins</a>, and other tooling are available, you can realize the benefit of being listed on <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, and make sure you are fully plugged into my regular monitoring of the API space, which means the chances are much, much higher that I will write a story about what you, and your developers are up to. ;-)</p>

<p>This story is derived from listening to the <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">API podcast, Traffic and Weather</a>. One of the things John Sheehan (<a href="/admin/blog/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>), and Steve Marx (<a href="https://twitter.com/smarx">@smarx</a>) discussed during the recent show, was a post Steve wrote as part of his role as product manager, called "<a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2015/04/how-many-http-status-codes-should-your-api-use/">How many HTTP status codes should your API use</a>"? I think the story is extremely useful to read, helping us all think through how we use HTTP status codes in our own platform, but personally I think the real story, is Dropbox talking out loud about their strategy.</p>
<p>John and Steve pointed out on the podcast that someone had tweeted that the story was not in sync with the way Dropbox actually did their HTTP status codes. To which Steve replied, that is why he wrote the story, to talk it out, and solicit feedback. This is how you should be thinking through your API road map, out loud, on your platform blog. When I mention to API providers that the blog is the most important tool in their toolbox, this is what I mean. Your blog isn&rsquo;t just for broadcasting your platform message, it is also about you thinking through thoughts, sharing those thoughts with your API consumers, and potentially getting feedback, which you can consider as part of the overall decision making process.</p>
<p>I am addicted to thinking through my ideas publicly on my blog. For me, a thought isn&rsquo;t fully formed, until its published. I also depend heavily on the feedback from my audience to my stories, in their public comments on Disqus, and Twitter, as well as privately via email and DMs. Talking things through, publicly on your blog, teaches you to think outside the box, let the sunlight in on your thoughts, and forces you to (potentially) properly form your ideas (not always), at least enough to share with the public--even if you don&rsquo;t end up getting feedback, that process alone, is highly valuable.</p>
<p>The best part of this, is after you&rsquo;ve thought through your stories, received feedback from your API consumers, the story also has the potential to live on as a marketing vehicle, which is what I feel most people think of when I mention a blog for API operation. All of this creates a potentially virtuous cycle, that is essential to API evangelism and the overall road map. If you do this type of storytelling regularly, thoroughly thinking through your ideas, and opening them up to public comment before you finalize your road map, eventually you will find that you have momentum in some very positive directions, and are generating some extremely valuable exhaust from your efforts that also brings in new API consumers, and helps keep the existing API consumers engaged.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://3drobotics.com/home-2014/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/3d-robotics/3d-robotics-drone.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As my Internet of Things (IoT) research continues, I&rsquo;m applying much of my API thinking from the mainstream API space to the world of IoT. A couple weeks ago I stumbled across the <a href="http://api.3drobotics.com/swagger-ui/">3D Robotics Drone API</a>, which to my surprise, was documented using a Swagger specification, providing a machine readable definition of the API, which helped me quickly get up to speed on what the Drone API delivers.</p>
<p>I haven't put much thought into the detail for any drone APIs, something that has been adjacent to my mainstream research for over a year now, but I did have some basic opinions about what a drone API could have. So, when it comes to potential resources, I have to say the  3D Robotics Drone API delivers in all earlier areas I had been considering--with five main endpoints:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Vehicle API </strong>- Exposes operations for browsing and searching lists of vehicle, and retrieving single vehicle, including airspeed, ground speed, and battery.</li>
<li><strong>The Mission API -&nbsp;</strong>Exposes operations for browsing and searching lists of mission, and retrieving single mission.</li>
<li><strong>The Administrator API </strong>- Access to administrative resources including debugging, logging, and flight simulation.</li>
<li><strong>The User API - </strong>Access operations for browsing and searching lists of user, and retrieving single user.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication </strong>- Session operations for logging in and out, and identifying user.</li>
</ul>
<p>The vehicle stuff I expected, but I was pleasantly surprised to see the resources around logging, and specifically the mission API. When it comes to transparency, and accountability around drone activity, I feel pretty strongly that these types of resources will be essential, and eventually will be mandated by government entities. I&rsquo;m glad that 3D Robotics is ahead of the game, in providing API driven resources that deliver in this way.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t expect, when I stumbled across the user and mission management APIs, was the social, online layer. As part of the 3D Robotics Drone API platform, the company offers <a href="http://www.droneshare.com">DroneShare</a>, where you can publish your user profile, and your <a href="http://www.droneshare.com/mission">missions</a>. I was coming at this from the angle of a potential industry regulation tool, or possible drone pilot resource management&mdash;I didn't think it would be done as social, and potential entertainment platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.droneshare.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/3d-robotics/Droneshare-Screnshot.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Here is the description from the site:</p>
<blockquote><em>"This is the beta release of Droneshare. Droneshare is a mission viewing and sharing application that works with ground control applications to let you share your mission data. This project is open source, if you would like to improve it, it is probably best to start at our github repo."</em></blockquote>
<p>This is why I thoroughly enjoy doing my research, because it expands my understanding of specific business sectors that APIs are touching. While I was discovering DroneShare, I also learned about the existence of the "<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/drone/no-fly/">Don&rsquo;t Fly Drones Here</a>&rdquo; project, from Mapbox, which provides a database resource of restricted zones, where you can&rsquo;t fly drones. Which brought me back to my original thoughts, regarding what resource we will need to keep the drone industry sane, rather than just focusing on social and entertainment.</p>
<p>Ultimately I see a lot of patterns here, that reflect several possible drone futures we are potentially crafting. I see social networks, where drone pilots compete for the best jobs, based upon their missions, and equipment usage. I also see potential for entertainment--think about the networks that have arisen for watching people play videogames, and competitive gaming platforms, but apply that to the world of drones. I also see potential elements of government regulation, where the FAA and other agencies, require drone pilots to log their equipment, and activity, logging all drone flights, and potentially sharing publicly via drone social networks to increase accountability.</p>
<p><a href="http://3drobotics.com/home-2014/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/3d-robotics/3d-robotics-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In the end, I&rsquo;m thinking that the <a href="http://api.3drobotics.com/swagger-ui/">3D Robotics Drone API</a> provides  a potential blueprint that could be used by other drone manufacturers, and cloud platforms that serve the drone industry. The 3D Robotics Drone API pattern could be held up as an open specification, that the government could weigh in on, making sure the proper regulatory resources are available, and that drone activity can be accessed, and audited via a secure API, available via the Internet.</p>
<p>The world of drones is fascinating to me. On one hand, the security and privacy considerations scare the shit out of me. On the other hand, they are endlessly fascinating to me, and ultimately I&rsquo;m going to be purchasing a drone, so I can play with more, and understand better&mdash;its a business expense you know!</p>
<p>Man, I have a great career. I'm so privileged to be doing what I do&mdash;even if our world is under a threat of attack by drones!</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2015</span>

<p>I was dedicating some time to researching APIs in the Internet of things (IoT) space, and stumbled across the <a href="https://api.myfox.me/">Myfox API</a>, serving the <a href="https://www.getmyfox.com/us_en/">Myfox home security products</a>. While the developer portal for the Myfox API doesn't have everything I'd like to see in an IoT developer portal, it is one of the better one's I've seen.</p>
<p>If you think web or mobile app developers suck at providing a simple, and a coherent developer portal and experience, device platform providers are even worse. The Myfox API, has the essential building building blocks, with a simple overview, authentication info, simple Swagger driven API documentation, application management tools, and a clear terms of service for the platform.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a clear link between the primary Myfox website, the developer portal, and a <a href="https://myfox.me/">myfox.me user portal</a>, for device consumers and would-be developers to easily on-board with everything. I haven't fully profiled that Myfox platform, but at first glance it is clean, well laid out, and most importantly the link between the website, API, and user accounts is clear, and easy to navigate.</p>
<p>As I think this through, and after recently finishing a white paper called <a href="http://research.gigaom.com/report/building-an-api-driven-ecosystem-for-the-internet-of-things/">Building an API-driven Ecosystem for the Internet of Things</a>, for the now defunct GigaOm, I can't help but think the IoT space is going to need to agree on some sort of standard approach for not just managing how they design, deploy, and manage APIs, but also how they deliver developer and user portals. To help you visualize what I mean, consider the number of Internet connected devices any single household will own, all with their own portal, and on-boarding process. #FUN</p>
<p>In short, developers, and end-users will get IoT account fatigue pretty quick. I don't think that we are going to standardize everything across the space, I am not delusional, but I can't help but think that the sharing of some common blueprints, could go a long ways in reducing friction for developers, and device consumers. I'll take my research from the GigaOm white paper and produce a blueprint, that IoT device makers can use, to to hopefully be more successful in deploying their developer portals, platform accounts, and maybe help influence a tiny bit of consistency in how IoT platforms function.</p>

<p>The machine readable API Blueprint definition, driving the documentation now has the potential to be accessible. This may not seem like much, but it is actually fundamental to the health, and growth of the overall API industry. Developers cannot learn from other developers, and from leading API platforms, and share best practices for API design across the space without it&mdash;we need this to grow, and evolve.</p>
<p><a href="https://apiblueprint.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-blueprint/apiblueprint-logo-2.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This is one of the reasons <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/30/quantifying-the-community-around-the-swagger-api-specification/">Swagger has seen such wide adoption</a>, because it isn&rsquo;t just an open format, it is also because the API definitions that these public platforms generate are also available to share, and learn from. You can still lock down the valuable resources made available via an API, but the interface patterns we apply to our APIs should be shared as widely as possible, for everyone to see. This is why I&rsquo;ve been fighting so hard <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/amicus-brief-computer-scientists-scotus">to push back against Oracle in their API copyright case against Google</a>&mdash;API designs do not need to be locked up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been able to find API Blueprints on the open web, and on Github for some time now, but this opens up the playing field to be able easily discovery, and engage with existing Apiary, and API Blueprint driven APIs at a new level. Much of what I&rsquo;ve learned about Swagger and API design has come from being able to click on the raw link on Swagger UI, and reverse engineer the Swagger definition behind the curtain. I&rsquo;ve never been able to do this with API Blueprint, or Mashery I/O docs. I have been able to get at the WADL behind the Apigee Explorer, but it is a pain in the ass, and the definitions are usually out of date by the time I get to it.</p>
<p>The effects of Apiary&rsquo;s move won&rsquo;t be some immediate thing, it will take time, but the more API Blueprints that are shared, the more users will learn about the powerful API definition format driving many public APIs&mdash;this is good for Apiary, good for API providers, and good for API consumers. Thanks Apiary for doing this, it makes me happy. It also gives me a head start on making sure <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack</a> is API Blueprint fluent, and that more API Blueprint driven APIs are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">present in my research</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to be able to cut back on my travel in 2015, and focus on some important research, coding, and writing. I apologize to all the events I&rsquo;ve said no to over the last couple months, but I hit a wall last year with speaking, and trying hard to make 2015 a much more healthier, and balanced year.</p>
<p>With that said, here is where you can find me this spring. I have three places you can find me in April and May:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Berlin, Germany</strong>&nbsp;- You can find me in Berlin, putting on <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIDays / @APIStrat, April 24th &amp; 25th</a></li>
<li><strong>Barcelona, Catalonia</strong> - I will be speaking at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">APIDays Mediterranea, May 6th &amp; 7th, in Barcelona</a></li>
<li><strong>Broomfield, CO</strong> 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://apistrat.com/2nd-annual-api-strategy-practice-tech-un-workshops-gluecon-2015/">@APIStrat Tech Un-Workshops @ Gluecon May 19th</a> (1:00-5:00 PM)</li>
<li>Leading the Swagger conversation at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Swagger-API/events/221572540/">Swagger API Meetup @ Gluecon May 19th</a> (7:00-9:00 PM)</li>
<li>Gluecon - I will be at <a href="http://gluecon.com/">Gluecon 2015, May 20th, and 21st, speaking</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That is all the speaking I&rsquo;m doing this spring, with one tentative date early in June at BYU. I won&rsquo;t be traveling again until the fall, when we do @APIStrat again, and of course @DefragCon!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be in Berlin and Barcelona, two of my favorite European cities, and of course Broomfield, CO (specifically the Taproom). I am also excited to not be traveling as much, and able to focus on my wider research, coding, and writing. #thanks</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-portal-developer-github.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spend a lot of time looking through the developer portals of API providers. I see a lot of things, both the good and bad, while navigating these  portals, and while some of the bad stuff I see are way too big for me to doing anything, there are many little things I see that I could help do something about. Sometimes it is just spelling mistakes, sometimes broken links, and other times I want to rewrite API descriptions, and add to the resources that are available for an API.</p>
<p>During these travels, I got to thinking...what if API providers published their developer portals to Github? Just like I do with my API Evangelist sites. Then I could fork their portal, and submit pull requests with rewrites of the description of what your API does, adding little tweaks, here and there, helping polish the portal--potentially making things easier for developers. I&rsquo;m sure this thought scares the hell out of some companies, who can&rsquo;t imagine, allowing outside input like this, but if you sit down and think about it for a while, it just might make sense.</p>
<p>When I was in Washington D.C., <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/dev-hub/">I created a default portal template that runs on Github</a>. I might upgrade this, and make it available for API providers to use as a forkable template, to seed any API developer portal. Doing this makes it easy to provide a base set of building blocks that every API provider should start with, allowing them to delete the elements that they don&rsquo;t want. I am also considering making a default one, that can be used as a starter developer portal for Internet of Things (IoT) platforms.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoy the pull requests that I get for spelling and grammar mistakes I made on API Evangelist, from some of my favorite grammar trolls. Running all of my websites on Github Pages has changed the way I tell stories, and interact with my audience. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/08/api-management-using-github/">I&rsquo;ve always encouraged API providers to use Github for an increasing number of API management tasks</a>, but actually running your entire portal as a Github repo, would this to a new level. This approach could be used for larger, or smaller developer platforms, and <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/11/16/public-frontend-and-private-backend-for-my-sites-on-github/">I even use Github pages as a front-end for private API developer portals</a>--ask me how.</p>
<p>It is just a suggestion for you API providers, and soon to be API providers. Github provides a very low cost, scalable way to launch your portal, and you never know, people like me who spend a lot of time in your developer portal, might actually help make it a better place. I wish more API providers would publish their portal as a Github repository, as well as graphic designers in the space help craft template portals, that providers can put to work. My portal definitions will always reflect best practices that I see across the API landscape, but they won&rsquo;t always be the slickest looking when it comes to graphic design&mdash;just not my core competency.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/alchemy/alchemy-api-ibm-version.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was doing my regular monitoring, and found myself on the <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/">AlchemyAPI</a> site. Not exactly sure how I got there, but I stumbled across their <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/combined/htmlc.html">HTMLGetCombinedData</a>&nbsp;API, which can be used for analysis on HTML content, and is one of 3 separate APIs, AlchemyAPI is calling "combined calls".</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with AlchemyAPI, the company has a number of valuable APIs, which you can use to make sense of content and data from on, or offline source. I use AlchemyAPI for API Evangelist, to pull keywords, and the content out of blog posts, helping me shed the overall look of a site, and any advertisements--getting down to the raw content. What I thought was particularly interesting about this API, was their approach combined calls, and specifically their approach to monetizing these aggregated API calls.</p>
<p>There are three specific APIs they are considering "combined calls":</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/combined/urls.html">URLGetCombinedData</a></strong> - Used for performing analysis on a publicly-accessible Internet web pages.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/combined/htmlc.html">HTMLGetCombinedData</a></strong> - Used for performing analysis on uploaded HTML content.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/combined/textc.html">TextGetCombinedData</a></strong> - Used for performing analysis on uploaded text content.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three APIs are only available in the AlchemyAPI&nbsp;<a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/products/pricing">pro and enterprise packages</a>, which for me makes see this aa a potentially new approach to <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a>. I don&rsquo;t see it as something that works for all API providers, but when you have numerous decoupled APIs, which developers may also be implemented several of them at a time, or daisy chaining them together&mdash;a combined API call, might save some developers valuable time.</p>
<p>Combined API calls also seem like a potential opportunity for API platform developers themselves. If an API platform, provides tools for developers to aggregate, and stitch together multiple APIs, and publish their recipes, it is something that could produce some interesting patterns, that may better deliver solutions to the problems developers actually face during integration. At the very least, allowing developers to publish SDKs that accomplish the same thing, might achieve the same thing.</p>
<p>I am just looking to share my thoughts on AlchemyAPIs approach to aggregating their API calls, and specifically the focus on monetization, adding the concept to my research. Maybe it is something others can for their API platforms, or maybe API developers, could provide aggregated API recipes, for specific API platforms, or across multiple platforms.</p>

I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>
<p>Always a good report, when I start with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>101</strong></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sproutsocial.com/insights/what-is-an-api/">What Is an API, and Why Does It Matter?</a> - I love coming across other introductory to API material. The space if getting so wide, that there are many good opinions emerging.</li>

<p>A handful of interesting <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Acquisitions</strong></span> to note:</p>

</ul>
<p>I'm calling these <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API Aggregation</strong></span>, but they are kind of a new take on the topic:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/combined/urls.html">AlchemyAPI Web Combined Call</a> - I thought this was an interesting approach to monetizing APIs, by saving developers time. In a world where you have a bunch of microservices that do one thing, and do it well, I think aggregate or combined API calls ike this as premium service will be more common.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/alchemyapi-text-combined-call">AlchemyAPI Text Combined Call</a> - Seems to be something they are doing across the board. Will keep an eye out for others doing this too.</li>

        <span class="post-date">02 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.blockspring.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The one thing I've learned in five years as the API Evangelist is that us technologists and developers don't always see the world like everyone else. We focus on the perfection of the technology, our own desires for the future, and often miss the mark on what end-users actually need. This is one of the hallmark success of APIs over SOA, is that by accident, APIs jumped out of the SOA petri dish (thanks Daniel Jacobson - <a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>), and was use solve everyday problems that end-users face, using the technology that is readily available (aka HTTP).</p>
<p>While I think us API folks have done a great job of delivering valuable resources to mobile applications, and a decent enough job at delivering the same resources to web applications, and I guess we are figuring out the whole device thing? maybe? maybe not? Regardless, one area we have failed to serve a major aspect of the business world, is delivering valuable API resources to the number #2 client in the world&mdash;the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>We have done a decent job of providing resources to data stewards, <a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">helping them deploy APIs using spreadsheets using services like API Spark</a>, but other than a handful of innovative implementations from companies like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/31/giving-excel-power-users-the-api-driven-resources-they-need/">Octoparts</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/20/route-sms-messages-to-google-spreadsheets-via-twilio-api-with-twiliosheet/">Twilio</a>, there are no solid API consumption resources that target the spreadsheet environment. Meaning there is no easy way for mainstream spreadsheet users to put common API driven resources to work for them within the spreadsheets that they live in daily--that is until today, with the launch of the&nbsp;<a href="https://api.blockspring.com/blog/blockspring-for-google-sheets">Blockspring launched their Google Spreadsheets Add-On</a>.</p>
<p>Yeah I know, making APIs work in spreadsheets has been done for a while, via Google Spreadsheets and Excel Spreadsheets, but nobody has standardized it like Blockspring just did. So let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the implementation. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blockspring/aihldeahgcpbpmimkdpkafaedhbmfhoh">I went to the Google Chrome App Store, and downloaded the add-on</a>.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then using a new spreadsheet, I click on add-ons &gt; Blockspring, and logged into my account. After giving Blockspring access to the Google Spreadsheet via my Google Account oAuth, I was given an API console in the right hand sidebar of my spreadsheet interface. The API options I&rsquo;m given aren't the usual geek buffet, they are everyday use scenarios that would attract the average spreadsheet users.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on-console.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I select the IMDB movie search, which once chosen, I&rsquo;m given the option to populate my spreadsheet with results, providing me with API driven resources, right in my worksheets. The best part is it is complete with one cell as a search term, allowing me to customize my IMDB search.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on-imdb.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Using Blockspring, I&rsquo;m given easy to use, API driven resources, that anyone can implement, like visualizing the recent news:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on-tools.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Or possibly evaluate stock volatility clustering, using stock market data APIs (cause you know we all do a lot of this):</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blockspring/blockspring-google-spreadsheets-add-on-tools-2.png" alt="" width="100%" align="right" /></p>
<p><br />Blockspring gives me over 1000 API driven functions that I can use in my Google Spreadsheet&mdash;kicking everyone&rsquo;s asses when it comes to potential API client delivery. While us technologists are arguing over whether or not we can automatically generated Swagger driven SDKs, and the importance of hypermedia APIs when deploying the next generation clients, someone like Blockspring comes along and pipes in APIs to the #2 client in the world&mdash;the spreadsheet. #winning</p>
<p>Now the game will be about getting the attention of Google Spreadsheet users, and developing comparable Microsoft Spreadsheet tooling, and getting mainstream Excel users attention as well. The rest of you will have to get the attention of Blockspring, and make sure your API resources have simple, meaningful endpoints that can be piped in as Blockspring Google Spreadsheet functions. Spreadsheet driven business units should not have to learn about APIs and go look for them, at each individual API portal&mdash;APIs providers should find and education business users about their resources, via one of the most ubiquitous tools in business.</p>
<p>Nice work Blockspring, in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/13/going-beyond-excel-as-a-data-source-for-api-deployment-and-focusing-on-it-as-an-api-client/">helping ensure the space move beyond excel as a data source for API deployment, and focusing on it as an API client</a>, delivering vital API resources to the business users who can potentially benefit the most, and are willing and able to pay for API access in my opinion.</p>
<p>P.S. As soon as I finished this I remembered this story from <a href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/">last weeks API.Report&nbsp;</a>-&nbsp;<a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/03/25/the-api-briefing-free-federal-energy-and-economic-information-delivered-straight-to-your-spreadsheet/">Free Federal Energy and Economic Information Delivered Straight to Your Spreadsheet</a> - not an standardized approach, but definitely an important implementation to showcase.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Apr 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/streamdata-io-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was introduced to <a href="http://streamdata.io/">StreamData.io</a> the other day, by Gabriel Dillon (<a href="https://twitter.com/gjdillon">@gjdillon</a>) of <a href="http://readme.io/">Readme.io</a>. StreamData.io provides a caching, and push layer for apps to take advantage of, that can be deploy on top of existing APIs. I haven&rsquo;t implemented StreamData.io yet, I am still evaluating it, and at first glance it looks like an interesting new real-time layer, that you can use on top of APIs, to improve application performance and user experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to add StreamData.io to <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">my real-time research</a> right now, however once I start playing with I may add as an API deployment resource as well. I have some verification to do, but I&rsquo;d love to test out the potential for StreamData.io to deliver cache and sync layer for common APIs, doing for APIs, what StreamData.io is doing for apps&mdash;delivering on one of my ongoing ideas for caching high use APIs.</p>
<p>When I was working in Washington DC, I had the pleasure of working during the federal government shutdown, where I wrote a piece <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/01/can-we-depend-on-federal-government-apis/">asking if we can depend on our federal government APIs</a>, and talked about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/12/caching-apis-with-cloudformations-or-openshift-/">caching APIs with AWS cloud formations, or Open Shift</a>. My objective is to ensure there redundant sources for APIs coming out of government, providing developers with a more stable solution, they can depend on. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/18/multiple-types-of-apisjson-for-discovery/">I even added this thinking into the early APIs.json design, allowing you to define cached indexes of APIs</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve added <a href="http://streamdata.io/">StreamData.io</a> to <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">my real-time research</a>, and I&rsquo;ll get in there and play with more, as I have the time. Then I&rsquo;ll get a better understanding of what you can do with the API caching and syncing, seeing if it is possible to deliver this layer for my APIs as well as my apps&mdash;something that is even more appealing in this age of Docker containers. #FoodForThought</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-key-skeleton.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was reading <a href="http://www.bizcoder.com/are-you-or-your-customers-leaking-your-api-keys">Are You Or Your Customers Leaking Your API Keys?</a> from Daryl Miller (<a href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">@darrel_miller</a>) the other day, which spurred me to float up a story in my Evernote, from a couple months back. My thoughts are only related to Daryll&rsquo;s because it is about API keys, and their accessibility&mdash;the similarities stop there. Daryl is talking about a very different layer of key management, which we should all be thinking deeply about.</p>
<p>API key management is an API provider issue, as much as it is an API consumer issue. As an API provider I need to have an easy way to manage all the keys I provide to developers. As an API consumer, I need to have an easy to manage all the API keys I get across the API providers that I depend on. In short, key management isn&rsquo;t easy, and there are no clear solutions that serve both ends of the key management coin.</p>
<p>As an API provider, I use <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API Infrastructure to manage my API keys</a>. Using my API portal, developers can sign up for their own accounts, manage their apps, and the keys that are issued. 3Scale does all the heavy lifting for me, all I have to do is manage my API service composition, and keep an eye on dev usage, as well as keep an eye on my own app usage. I use all my own APIs for my apps too! Sometimes my apps are the bad actors, it not always the developers who abuse API access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an API consumer, I&rsquo;m working hard to pull my API key world together, using a <a href="http://api-keys.apievangelist.com/">home brew format I&rsquo;m calling simple api-keys</a>. I&rsquo;m am using Github for all of my API and microservice related projects, so I&rsquo;m beginning to centralize how I store keys, and how I manage them across all my apps. With a central storage, and management process, I&rsquo;m hoping to get a better handle on which APIs I use, and introduce more regular cycles of key management, where I refresh API keys on a strict schedule.</p>
<p>With the work I&rsquo;m doing on the API consumption front, and reading Daryll&rsquo;s post got me thinking about keys. If our API management house is in order, and we can manage different groups of API keys, monitor their usage, and revoke them at will, why can&rsquo;t we just have a pool of API keys that we can just leave laying around? I&rsquo;ve seen many APIs provider default keys, embedded in URLs available in API documentation, allowing you to make sample calls, why can&rsquo;t we apply this a little bit wider? It seems like we could have a rolling pool of API keys, that we leave laying around in code snippets, how-to guides, and stories, which allow instant access to APIs&mdash;which we monitor, and if we see abuse we can revoke, and refresh with new set--easily done if you use Github Gists for storytelling (snippet centralization).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going through my entire API stack, and generating Postman Collections, and I&rsquo;m considering generating some API keys that are designed for use in specific stories, 101 resources, and other public and private evangelism efforts. It is just a thought at this point, that I wanted to put out there for discussion. Seems to me, if we really want to reduce any friction in on-boarding, we could start using &ldquo;some&rdquo; API keys in conjunction with SEO, SMM, and other existing evangelism metrics and analysis tools that are in our toolbox.</p>

        <p>This post is extracted from a deep dive I've been doing into the Swagger ecosystem, as part of regular conversations I have been having with Tony Tam (@fehguy), trying to understand how we can better tell stories about Swagger. I've been tuned into things for a while now around the Swagger community, and there is a lot going on, but from the outside, some of this can be hard to see. Seeking a better understand what is the Swagger community, I wanted to take a walk through the sites, forum, and Github repositories.</p>
<p>First let&rsquo;s start with the basics, what is Swagger? Merriam Webster defines Swaggers as: : to walk in a very confident way : to walk with a swagger. ;-) Seriously though, Swagger is a machine readable format (either JSON or YAML), for describing an API, providing a description of API operations, in a way that other applications can read, and understand. Even though Swagger is machine readable, and designed for other applications, it has also become a language for humans to describe and collaborate, around a shared, quantifiable, vision of what an API can do, throughout all stages of the API life cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to learn about Swagger yourself, you can tune into these channels to learn more:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://swagger.io/">Website</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/SwaggerApi">Twitter</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api">Github</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/swagger-swaggersocket">Google Group</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>My goal with this post is evolve my understanding and awareness of what Swagger is, and hopefully along the way I can help increase yours as well. In my experience, many people have a very distorted, and limited understanding of what Swagger is, and I&rsquo;d like to take some time to evolve that. When I started this research, my objective was to help Tony deliver a new website, and on-boarding materials for Swagger, assisting people of all skill levels in finding all things Swagger. I am just taking this moment to walk through what at I have so far, and craft a more robust version 1.0 narrative about what Swagger is, something that blogging helps me work through.</p>
<p>One of the biggest misconceptions I find when I talk with folks about Swagger, is that it is interactive documentation, when that is actually Swagger UI--when it comes to Swagger all roads start with the Swagger specification:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec)">Swagger-Spec</a> </strong>- The goal of Swagger is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md">You can find version 2.0 of the spec here</a>, which is the current active version in use. The Swagger spec lets you describe all the essential aspects of API operations, with information about the operator, the host and basePath for the API, details about what type of content it produces or consumes, like JSON or XML. Most importantly it lets you describe each of the paths for an API, with details on parameters, responses, and other details of each specific API path. Swagger also provides you with the ability to describe the underlying data model definitions, describing the valuable resources being served up via APIs.</p>
<p>To grasp the last paragraph, you have to have a pretty solid understanding of the moving parts of an API, but in short the Swagger spec gives us a language to potentially map out all of the common parts of an API. It also allows me to describe the security for each API, and tag to organize APIs into specific buckets. <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">I use Swagger to describe the almost 20 APIs my business uses daily, with varying amount of detail about each resource, and the information it serves up</a>. All the 20 of the Swagger definitions provide me with a machine readable map of my own IT infrastructure&mdash;as well as a common language that almost any other developer, or potentially not developer can learn to read, and work with.</p>
<p>With Swagger we now have a common way to communication around the APIs we develop, and also map out the public APIs we also depend on like Twilio, SendGrid, or even Twitter. Now what? Why do we do this? <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">There are an increasing number of incentives emerging for why you generate machine readable API definitions like Swagger</a>, which is part of the reason I&rsquo;m looking to further quantify the Swagger community, so I can add to the master list.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with what I&rsquo;d consider to be the primary building blocks of Swagger, developed by the Swagger team, as part of the core offering:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">swagger-ui </a>- </strong>Generation of interactive API documentation, which Swagger is often known for.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen">swagger-codegen</a> -</strong> Generation of client code in a variety of languages using a Swagger definition.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js">swagger-js</a> -</strong> A JavaScript library to connect to swagger-enabled APIs via browser or Node.js.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-socket">swagger-socket </a>- </strong>A REST over WebSocket tool for creating real-time integrations with Swagger.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node-express">swagger-node-express</a> -</strong> Swagger module for Node.js w/express module</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-scala-module">swagger-scala-module</a> -</strong>&nbsp;Swagger support for Scala.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor">swagger-editor</a> -&nbsp;</strong>A visual editor for Swagger.      
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Those six repositories represent the core tooling that the Swagger team has evolved around the specification, providing what I&rsquo;d consider to be three stops along the API life cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Server Code</li>
<li>Client Code</li>
</ul>
<p>Swagger is often known for its interactive API documentation (aka Swagger UI), but there has also been a lot of work done on the codegen platform, and editor, taking things well beyond just API documentation. This is just the beginning of what is possible with Swagger. In an effort to find out what else is being done with Swagger, and what is being built with the specification, I wanted to see what the community is up to, which platforms they are integrating it into, and what other standalone tooling is being built using Swagger.</p>
<p>I want a better understanding of the core group of companies who have embraced the Swagger specification, and baked it into their own platform. I know there are hundreds of them out there, but finding them can be easier said than done, especially when I'm looking some sort of public announcement, blog post, press release, service description, to use as my reference. So far I have <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">49 companies</span></strong> that I&rsquo;m tracking on, who have pulled the Swagger spec, and incorporated into their own platform and infrastructure.</p>

<p>This list represents a pretty interesting mix of folks who understand the potential of Swagger, and have invested in the community by making it a core part of their operations. I know there are more of these out there (a lot more), but they haven&rsquo;t talked publicly about what they are up to. This is just what I&rsquo;ve aggregated from going through the Swagger site, group, and Github repositories, and from what I already know of the API space, from my monitoring.<br /><br />After looking at the platforms who have pulled the Swagger specification into their operations, I wanted to see if I could also begin to quantify the community of APIs who have deployed Swagger UI, providing interactive API documentation for their own API platform. Since this is what Swagger is known for, I knew I would find quite a few to showcase. So far I have found 62:<br /><br /></p>

</table><p>Finding websites that have implemented Swagger UI is harder than you think. There are only three search engines I could find that let you search the source code of websites for JavaScript files and code. Ultimately I ended up mostly depending on my own ability to find new APIs, and manually uncover whether or not Swagger was actually in use. I&rsquo;m working on a stack of Swagger and API Blueprint discovery search engines, but they aren&rsquo;t quite ready for this dive.<br /><br />Next I wanted to look through some of the tooling that has evolved as part of the Swagger community, which Github is definitely the place to begin this journey. <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=swagger">When you search Github for the word Swagger, you get almost 1000 repositories</a>. I was going to programmatically explore these results, but found that manually browsing through them was the best path to take, allowing me to make a decision on what each developer was up to.<br /><br />The one thing I learned doing through this process&mdash;Swagger means many different things, to many different people. Most refer to Swagger, and mean Swagger UI, while others refer to it as generating server side code, or maybe client side code. Moving forward, there needs to be a lot of work done helped educate people about first, what Swagger is, a specification, and what are&nbsp; each of the areas of tooling that are built on top of the Swagger specification.<br /><br />Even after looking through the almost 1000 Swagger related Github projects, things are still very hazy for me, but I did learn a lot along the way, about what languages, frameworks and platforms developers are using Swagger, and the types of tools and integrations they are developing.</p>
<p>The best way to look at all of these projects is by language&mdash;here is the Github breakdown.</p>
<ul>
<li>411 JavaScript</li>
<li>135 Java</li>
<li>61 Ruby</li>
<li>41 Python</li>
<li>32 PHP</li>
<li>31 Scala</li>
<li>22 C#</li>
<li>17 Shell</li>
<li>13 Clojure</li>
<li>8 Groovy</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t accurate, because many of the JavaScript repositories are actually other languages. I forget to make sure Github knows what language a repo is sometimes too. Regardless, it gives you an idea of which programming languages developers are using to work with Swagger&mdash;one layer to look consider.<br /><br />Beyond the programming languages I want to know which platforms and frameworks developers are applying Swagger. Here are 36 frameworks and platforms I&rsquo;ve identified so far.</p>

<p>Beyond the programming languages, frameworks, and platform integrations I&rsquo;m looking to also understand the types of tools developers are actually building, and take Swagger beyond what the core development team, and working group could do. It is hard to understand the objectives of each of the developer projects I came across, but here are the X areas I&rsquo;ve identified so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Converter</li>
<li>Generator</li>
<li>Parser</li>
<li>Schema</li>
<li>Validator</li>
<li>Server</li>
<li>Command-Line</li>
<li>Powershell</li>
<li>Client</li>
<li>Proxy Generator</li>
<li>Aggregator</li>
<li>Tester</li>
</ul>
<p>This added a couple stops along the API life cycle for me, that Swagger is serving. I hadn&rsquo;t envisioned a Swagger powered CLI or Powershell tool. I&rsquo;ve only lightly thought about proxies, and aggregators driven by Swagger. When you bundle this with the platforms above who have integrated Swagger into their products and services, it starts to paint an even bigger picture of what is possible with Swagger.<br /><br />I think I&rsquo;m going to wrap up this dive into the Swagger ecosystem here. I still have all of the contributors, watchers, and people who have forked the core Swagger products, and well as many of the people involved in Swagger discussions via the Swagger Google Group and Twitter account to consider. Plus I think this article will flush out some other projects that are out there, being executed by my readers. Storytelling along the way is the best way to flush out hidden details in my opinion, and is one of the main reasons I&rsquo;m so transparent--I depend on people emailing and tweeting at me about stuff.<br /><br />This exercise has given me a new perspective on the Swagger community, and introduced me to some new companies, and tools. If you are doing anything cool with Swagger, please let me know, and I&rsquo;ll add it <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/">to my research</a>. Remember, if you don&rsquo;t tell the story about what your are doing with APIs, nobody knows, including me&mdash;API evangelism 101. This is just my first attempt to better quantify the Swagger community, and I&rsquo;m happy to include what you are up to in future updates.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Mar 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/community/post/Tx1HI1N5ZFX0PEK/Sign-up-Now-for-the-Amazon-Echo-Beta-SDK"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/amazon-echo/amazon_echo_main.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I've been tracking on the potential for voice APIs since Siri was first announced, a topic that often meant telephony like from Twilio, or audio transcription from Popup Archive and Clarify. When I close my eyes and think about the the future of APIs and voice enablement, it is more akin to the Siri example, where the digital world is (supposedly) just a voice command away.</p>
<p>Imagine making all your employee directory, company calendar, or product catalog available via voice commands. How do you do this? You do it with APIs, and a voice enablement platform in-between the application developers, and the available API resources. Much like all other voice enablement, I think we have a huge amount of work to get anywhere close to the pictures we all have in our head, when if comes to voice enablement.</p>
<p>It is my mission to find these signs across the API landscape, and keep an eye on what they are doing. One platform that is now open for beta is <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/community/post/Tx1HI1N5ZFX0PEK/Sign-up-Now-for-the-Amazon-Echo-Beta-SDK">Amazon Echo</a>. Amazon says, <em>"Echo is designed around your voice. It's always on&mdash;just ask for information, music, news, weather, and more.&rdquo; </em>APIs are how we will deliver on the &ldquo;more&rdquo; part of this equation. The difference between Apple Siri, and Amazon Echo at this point, is Amazon will let you (API providers) help deliver on the &ldquo;more&rdquo; part of Amazon Echo discovery equation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/community/post/Tx1HI1N5ZFX0PEK/Sign-up-Now-for-the-Amazon-Echo-Beta-SDK">signing up for the beta</a>, and if I get access, I will share more stories. I encourage you to sign up as well, and if you have any work your doing with Amazon Echo, or know of other API driven voice-enablement platforms I should be paying attention to, let me know.</p>
