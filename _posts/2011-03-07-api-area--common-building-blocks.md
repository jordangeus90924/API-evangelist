I have spent time reviewing [100 of the most popular APIs][1]. I am trying to determine a common set of building blocks that are essential to API adoption.

Here is a list of what I consider are the most common [building blocks for API][2] areas: <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/building%20blocks.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />

  * Overview
  * Getting Started
  * API Reference / Documentation
  * Code Samples
  * Blog
  * Forum
  * FAQ
  * Pricing
  * Terms and Conditions
The most successful APIs also provide self-service developer tools:
  * Registration
  * Application Registration
API pioneers like [Ebay][3], [Salesforce][4], [Flickr][5], and Google have established a common set of essential API building blocks through trial and error over the last decade.

Other API providers can learn from this [API history][6] and experience, and make sure they start with the essential API building blocks for sucess.
