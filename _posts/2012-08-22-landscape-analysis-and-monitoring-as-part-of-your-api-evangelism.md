{% include JB/setup %}<p>One very important aspect of API Evangelism is landscape analysis.When you launch an API, you need to have an intimate understanding of the landscape where you will be evangelizing your API and engaging with potential consumers.I always start by establishing potential 10K foot target areas that I will focusing on in my research.While these may vary from industry to industry, my starting list is: Individuals - Who are the key individual influencers in your target landscape Competitors - Know your competitors, you can learn a lot from what they do right or they do wrong Platforms - There are an endless amount of platforms that may benefit your company, such as Drupal, Wordpress and Salesforce Media - Who are the relevant media and blogs you should be following and engaging with Partners - Existing partners who you should be in tune with on the landscape After tackling these areas and identifying who the players are, you will identify other areas that are unique to your API evangelism efforts, so dont stress over whether you have the right areas in the first week.While researching these areas of my landscape I try to identify specific channels for getting plugged in with landscape targets: Website URL - What is the targets root URL for their website Blog URL - What is the blog for a target Blog RSS - Secondary to the blog, what is the RSS feed so I can programmatically monitor Twitter - What is a companies or individuals Twitter handle LinkedIn - Identify and sometimes connect with a target’s LinkedIn account Facebook - Identify and sometimes connect with a target’s Facebook account Github - Identify, follow and engage with a companies Github profile and appropriate repositories After getting the primary channels for each target on my landscape identified, I will go deeper sometimes and actually identify key individuals associated with target companies, either the founders and / or key employees.</p>
