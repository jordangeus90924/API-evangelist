I’m on a roll tonight, writing about [tension between API owners and consumers][1]. After some driving around California this week, I’ve had time to ponder three recent episodes with [Netflix][2], [LinkedIn][3] and [Craigslist][4]. This is my last post tonight, and was inspired by a Tweet from James Watters ([@wattersjames][5]):
