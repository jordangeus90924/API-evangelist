API security is different than traditional application security. APIs are the place you can get a handle on the security across all applications and integrations, but it is also where you can so easily go wrong with properly securing your digital resources and capabilities. API security involves every stage of the API lifecycle, making it something you do before and after you develop an API, and something you are never quite done with. 

It is common for companies to think they are done with API security once they publish their APIs to the gateway, applying OAuth, API keys, or some other form of authenitcation. This is just one milestone in the API security jurney that will play out over and over as teams work to secure the hundreds or thousands of APIs being delivered behind web, mobile, and device applications. API security will begin centrally with InfoSec groups, but will be something that is present across every stage of the API lifecycle and across teams.
