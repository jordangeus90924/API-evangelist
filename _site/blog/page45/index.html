        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/05/12/gathering-my-thoughts-with-apis-in-higher-education/">Gathering My Thoughts With APIs In Higher Education</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 May 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/priorities/university-of-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I had too many scribbles in my Evernote about work I&rsquo;m doing for <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/index.html">APIs in higher education</a>, so I decided I need to publish as a story, which hopefully will help me organize my thoughts, figure out my next moves, and share what I&rsquo;m doing to a couple of folks who asked what I&rsquo;m up to in this area.</p>
<p><strong>APIs In Higher Education Institutions</strong><br /> To keep API Evangelist operating I have some very supportive partners who invest in my research, and one of the areas <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a>&nbsp;and I work together on is understanding how APIs are currently being used in higher education. As part of my recent research I went back through the <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/index.html">universities I track on</a> who have APIs, to see whats changed, and I stumbled upon the fact that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/23/browsing-the-261-apis-at-brigham-young-university/">BYU&rsquo;s API inventory has grown to a mind blowing 261 APIs</a>, covering almost all aspects of university operations.</p>
<p>I will be continuing this research on what BYU is up to, but also the 10 other institutions I&rsquo;m tracking on, and as I do with other areas of the API space, try to identify some of the common building blocks universities are employing&mdash;hoping to create a blueprint that other institutions can follow.  You can find all this research, kindly supported by <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a>, up on the <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/index.html">Github repository designated for the project</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Dept of Education and FAFSA API</strong><br />Beyond the general use of APIs by universities, last November I started working on a <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/">prototype of an API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid or FAFSA form</a>, looking to jump start a conversation at the Department of Education around APIs. It worked, and in January they announced that they would looking to get feedback on what an API for FAFSA would look like.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes I was contacted to provide a proposal for a FAFSA API, hoping to chase after some budget that could fund such a project. I worked for two days on a proposal, submitted, but haven&rsquo;t heard anything more about what happened to that budget chase.</p>
<p>Then in April, the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/blog/2014/04/how-can-the-department-of-education-increase-innovation-transparency-and-access-to-data/">Department of Education asked the public to weigh in on an RFI around APIs</a> not just for FAFSA, but at the Department of Education in general. I need another week or so to gather up all of my work from the last six months around APIs in higher education, and the Department of Education, then probably write another story or two and respond to the RFI before the June deadline.</p>
<p><strong>Reclaim Your Domain</strong><br /> I went down to Atlanta to participate in a talk about the domain of one&rsquo;s own program at Emory University, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/05/01/exploring-the-domain-universe-at-emory-university/">you can read more about it in an earlier pos</a>t. I&rsquo;m feeling a seismic shift in my world, and telling stories about using APIs to reclaim your content and data, is something I will be talking about a lot more. What is really fascinating for me is that the inspiration for doing this work to help individuals better understand and control their online world is coming out of leading higher education institutions like MIT, University of Mary Washington and Emory. You can follow <a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/">my personal reclaim project on Github</a> for real-time updates in this area of my work.</p>
<p><strong>Data &amp; Analytics MOOC At UT Arlington</strong><br /> In addition to Atlanta, I was i<a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/05/01/apis-edx-tableau-google-at-ut-arlington/">n Arlington TX talking about the role APIs could play in a data and analytics MOOC at UT Arlington</a>. While the goal was to understand how students can use APIs to better explore data &amp; analytics, I left thinking about APIs for edX, and how we can develop a single course or group landing page that allows teachers and students to aggregate profiles and content using APIs and oAuth&mdash;a project I will be working on more using <a href="https://oauth.io/">oAuth.io</a>.</p>
<p><strong>APIs and edX</strong><br /> While in Texas I had the pleasure of hanging out with the <a href="https://www.edx.org/how-it-works">folks from edX</a>, the online course platform that offers interactive online classes and MOOCs from MITx, HarvardX, BerkeleyX, UTx and other universities, and of course we got talking APIs. An API is in their roadmap, but definitely something I would like to explore more as well here on the blog. I can&rsquo;t imagine any online learning solution, between universities being successful in 2014 without an API! ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Ok, Now What's Next?</strong><br /> I think that is it. I just needed to write all that down, after a crazy couple of weeks. Now it is easier to see the main action items:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Respond to Department of Education RFI</li>
<li>Create v1 of a APIs in higher education blueprint</li>
<li>Push forward with my personal Reclaim Your Domain</li>
<li>Develop class or group profile and content aggregation page that runs on Github using oAuth.io</li>
<li>Think about what an API program would look like for edX</li>
<li>Pull together a list of good APIs that could be used in a data &amp; analytics course</li>
</ul>
<p>That gives me six clear action items to move forward with, out of this hectic slice of my API research pie&mdash;higher education. I think if I can push forward with this chunk of work I can further kickstart the conversation around healthy API usage across higher education.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m biased, because of my proximity to <a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>, but I&rsquo;m hoping that the university is where we can make the biggest impact in educating people about the opportunities and the dangers of APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-voice/oraclevgoogle/oraclevgoogle.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I wanted to comment on the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-voice/oraclevgoogle/223105653-Oracle-Google-Java-Appeal-Decision.pdf" target="_blank">response yesterday in the Oracle v. Google case being played out in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a>. This appeal is important to me because it will not just set the tone for how APIs are designed, deployed and managed, but also because <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/11/02/help-eff-make-case-for-no-copryight-on-apis/">I worked with the EFF to craft the Amicus Brief</a>, and <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/oracle-v-google/amici">signed on as one of the computer scientists</a> in opposition of API copyright--making the response a huge blow to me personally.</p>
<p>The case is far from settled, so I will refrain from using hyperbole when I describe the situation, but will echo the EFF&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/dangerous-ruling-oracle-v-google-federal-circuit-reverses-sensible-lower-court">the implications of this decision are significant, and dangerous</a>&rdquo;.  For me, it doesn&rsquo;t change the conversation, it just re-enforces what I already believe, and hopefully it will do the same amongst API providers across the space.</p>
<p>Steve Willmott of <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> and I read the writing on the wall when we started <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> last year, that a political line was being drawn by the Oracle v Google appeal, and would not just continue to play out in the courts, but also within the heart of the API economy, and that we needed to collectively stand up and push back--API Commons is a back-burn strategy for the wildfire that Oracle has set.</p>
<p>API Commons basically declares that API definitions are ultimately copyrightable or licensable as code, depending on your viewpoint, all you do is hang your definition in the API Commons, and provide a reference to the license that matters to you, whether it <a href="https://twitter.com/mamund/status/464907589294116865">licensed as content (CC) or software (FSF)</a>&nbsp;is your call. Giving every API provider a torch, and the ability to participate in setting the back-burn, taking a stance in the Oracle v Google wildfire that has been set by Oracle, that could potentially burn down all of our collective resources.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Oracle v Google is just one of many battles that will occur within this new, virtual layer of our economy, and will ultimately define whether a company's approach to delivering digital services is more about governance and monetization (SOA), or about access and innovation (API)&mdash;exposing heart of the SOA v API debate.</p>
<p>Changing my metaphor from forest fire being set by Oracle, to seeing the API economy as an engine&mdash;Oracle is replacing the engine oil with glue, and then enabling any company to sell you a solvent + oil to make it better. If the API economy is our baby, Oracle is introducing smoke and alcohol into the womb, which will stunt the growth of the space, and impact not just the rest of us, but also stupidly Oracle&rsquo;s own revenue. Ok I lied, I got all fired up and shifted into hyperbolic gear! ;-) Vrooom!!</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time trying to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/26/what-can-the-enterprise-learn-from-the-open-api-space/">help the enterprise understand what makes APIs work versus their latest SOA approach</a>, and often times I find explaining this difference is akin to teaching dark matter and physics, or the concept of evolution to evangelical christians in rural america. The enterprise is blind to many of the elements that make APIs work, with all the vital elements lost in the quest for profit and control within the industries they operate in.</p>
<p>Generating a machine readable definition of your API, with accompanying licensing model, is just <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/10/the-levers-dials-and-switches-for-your-participation-in-the-api-economy/">going to be one more lever we will have to adjust when dialing in the political settings for our APIs</a>, which sucks big-time, but ultimately is doable with the leadership demonstrated by API providers across startups, SMS, enterprise, government, and non governmental organizations when they submit their API definitions to the API Commons, accompanied with a liberal or publicly available license.</p>
<p>As new API discovery models emerge, and <a href="http://api500.com/">API ratings models evolve</a>, the license of your API definition will set the tone for the conversation you have with your API consumers. As the usage of machine readable API definitions grows, and API discovery and rating becomes automated, your API licensing will be the difference in whether or not your API even shows up in a search result, or not.</p>
<p>You will have to excuse my brief rant, in response to the Oracle v Google appeal. I currently have the flu after being in Germany for API Days Berlin, and finding it difficult to formulate a coherent, lengthy response. Much like the overall debate, I think I will have to break the response from the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit down, publish as bite-size chunks that will stimulate discussion via my <a href="http://apivoice.com">API Voice</a> blog over time, and evolve my own understanding--refining my arguments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The discussion around API copyright is far from over. I don&rsquo;t have much hope for the results of the fair use discussion, that will continue as part of the case, but I do have hope when it comes to API providers stepping up to take a stance on the subject. Additionally, Oracle can count on me being the "Johnny Fucking Appleseed of API Definitions", convincing companies, organizations and governments of all sizes to publish their API definitions to the commons. Then also being as prolific in designing and defining the next generation of APIs ahead of the enterprise, as I am in writing on my blog(s), making sure that the best API design patterns are openly licensed and put into the commons for everyone to use--before your slow, bloated enteprise can even understand what the hell is going on.</p>
<p>Game on! Fuck you Oracle!</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/acme/acme-corp.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I just turned down a potential partnership with a major enterprise company. As I do with many stories, I will scrub the names of those involved, because there is no reason to blame a single company, this is a lesson any large entity can learn from&mdash;for this story, we&rsquo;ll just call them Acme Inc.</p>
<p>Acme Inc. contacted me a couple weeks ago, stating they were looking to do some research into the API space, and have been following my work for some time. After a few emails we made time to get on the phone and talk about what each of us were up to.</p>
<p>We spent about an hour, where I gave my history, why I do API Evangelist, and how I go about generating short form, and long form content as part of my research across the API space. Acme Inc. shared their interest in exploring how APIs could be applied to a couple of business sectors, and were looking to generate white paper(s) that they could distribute internally, and amongst partners.</p>
<p>Acme was extremely vague on details, and I understand that not everyone can be as open as me, especially when you work at a big company. We ended the call, agreeing that we&rsquo;d explore what a potential partnership might look like, around research projects, but they would need me to sign an NDA first&mdash;no problem.</p>
<p>I received an NDA via email a couple days later, as I was on my way to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/01/business-of-internal-apis-at-ibm-impact-last-tuesday/">IBM Impact in Las Vegas</a>, and while I was busy in Las Vegas I received an a reminder to please sign the agreement. When I was done in Las Vegas, on my way to  <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/05/01/apis-edx-tableau-google-at-ut-arlington/">Texas for another engagement</a>, I signed the NDA, printed a PDF and sent it back.  A few days later, as I was leaving Texas, on my way home to LA for about 8 hours, before <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/01/i-will-be-speaking-at-apidays-in-berlin-next-week/">I left to Berlin</a>, I received another email requesting that I sign a second NDA, this time using a digital signature solution.</p>
<p>At this point my inbox was already out of control, and I boarded the 12 hour flight Berlin, and proceeded to gear up for <a href="http://berlin.apidays.io/">APIDays Berlin</a>. After a day in Berlin where I finished my talk (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">which I rewrote onsite to better suit the local audience</a>), and two days of the amazing interactions at API Days Berlin, I finally made it back into my inbox.</p>
<p>This time I found another reminder, to sign the digital copy of NDA. At this point, I&rsquo;ve received 2 separate NDAs, and two reminders to please sign the NDA--ith no knowledge of what the ideas are. Maybe these are ideas or research I&rsquo;m already working on? Who the fuck knows!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLFO4ZV0i4&amp;feature=kp"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/acme/dont-give-fuck.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just sent an email to my Acme representative, stating that I will regretfully decline the partnership, and summarized my feelings. Acme thanked me.</p>
<p>With this response, I probably blew off thousands of dollars in revenue, and who knows what else. In the end I don&rsquo;t give a fuck. What I do is not about revenue or showcasing partnerships with global companies. It is about ideas, research and my storytelling, whether it is short form (blog) or longer form (whtie papers), or in person, and always in a way that provides value to the community.</p>
<p>I understand that a large entity cannot operate like I do--I&rsquo;m not naive. However when it comes to the world of APIs, if you want to play, you have to learn to open up, and at least be able to have conversations without the need for an NDA. People in the enterprise might fuck you over at every turn, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but I do not.</span> You can ask me to keep something private, and I will&mdash;end of story.</p>
<p>This is the fundamental difference between APIs and SOA that so many enterprise practitioners do not understand. As an individual I am so much happier being able to openly share my ideas, stories, code, and other resources publicly, in a way that is openly licensed, and most importantly&mdash;accessible by everyone. I strongly feel that there is a lot for the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/26/what-can-the-enterprise-learn-from-the-open-api-space/">enterprise to learn from the world of open APIs</a>, which isn&rsquo;t just about technology.  However, I&rsquo;m gambling that most of them will never give a flying fuck.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/05/07/green-button-energy-api-added-to-api-commons/">Green Button (Energy) API Added To API Commons</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 May 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.greenbuttondata.org/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/green-button/green-button.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the most meaningful API projects I work on with the US government is the <a href="http://energyos.github.io/OpenESPI-GreenButton-API-Documentation/">Green Button AP</a>I, which provides access to energy data for US consumers across the country.  First, what is the Green Button API? The Green Button builds on top of the Green Button data initiative which is:</p>
<blockquote><em>...an industry-led effort that responds to a White House call-to-action: provide electricity customers with easy access to their energy usage data in a consumer-friendly and computer-friendly format via a "Green Button" on electric utilities' website.</em></blockquote>
<p>Which Todd Park, Assistant to the President and U.S. Chief Technology Officer states:</p>
<blockquote><em>Giving residential and commercial customers secure access to their own energy data in a standard, easy-to-understand format will help them visualize their energy use and identify opportunities to save money. At the same time, Green Button is spurring the development of new online tools and services that add value to this information, creating an innovative new domain for entrepreneurship and job creation.</em></blockquote>
<p>The Green Button API delivers flexible access to Energy Usage Information through a set of RESTful interfaces, providing access any consumers Green Button data. The Green Button API is being designed by <a href="https://www.energyos.org/">EnergyOS</a>, providing a solution that any utility can download and run to mediate access between their retail energy customers, and 3rd parties who will provide energy data driven services to them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very excited to announce that the Green Button API definition has been added to the <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>. The Green Button API represents why 3Scale and API Evangelist launched API Commons, to provide a place where we can hang the most important, and meaningful API interfaces, and underlying data models, to encourage re-use.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="http://energyos.github.io/OpenESPI-GreenButton-API-Documentation/API/api-docs">Swagger specification for the Green Button API on Github</a>, complete with <a href="http://energyos.github.io/OpenESPI-GreenButton-API-Documentation/API/">interactive documentation</a> and other resources.

<p>I heard an interesting statement this week at <a href="http://berlin.apidays.io/">APIDays Berlin</a> that I&rsquo;ve heard before, "API document is an bug not a feature". The logic behind this is that if you design a proper API, using proven REST and hypermedia patterns, you shouldn&rsquo;t need documentation.</p>
<p>While this is true, and I agree with 100%, it ignores the vital process of getting the average person up to speed--simply stating that what many of us are actively doing, and what we currently know is a bug. I work with any folks who barely know what an API is, or what JSON is, yet have a lot of influence and control over whether some very important APIs exist, or not!</p>
<p>I know that these API experts are speaking to the correct path that we should be taking, yet there is very little consideration to understanding where most folks are on the path, and how many forks there are in the road, before we get to where we need to be.</p>
<p>To help those understand the path, think of the numerous APIs in the past with no documentation, then all of a sudden static API documentation was the norm, and now in 2014, interactive documentation has become commonplace.</p>
<p>Alongside this journey the debate around REST, and recently hypermedia has been going on, with only recently getting to a place where healthy patterns are being used across many APIs, not just a handful of demos.</p>
<p>Understanding this will help you see the path that we are on. A path that we can only move down at a certain speed, because it takes careful education and planning to move not just developers, but business leaders down. Maybe eventually the path will be a highway, and at some point a freeway that we can get more people down, but for now it takes a lot of planning to shepherding to move everyone along.</p>
<p>I fully respect those that wish to exclusively remain in the academic discussion of API design and deployment. As this is a layer of the space that I follow very closely and use to educate myself, and pull valuable ideas and information from, while telling stories on my blog.</p>
<p>However, my goal with this post is to help recruit the next generation of evangelists, who closely follow the leading edge of the API sector and where we should be going, but also want to help understand how to build a roadmap to help get the rest of the world, safely down the path to where we should be, with storytelling that can reach the masses.</p>

<p>We live in a very exciting time, one where the resources we need to build meaningful websites and applications, that have the opportunity to impact how we do business, and potentially make change in how the world around us, is rapidly expanding. Once upon a time, many of these digital resources took millions of dollars of investment to deliver, if they were available at all. Now, with the introduction of web APIs, many valuable resources are available in a self-service, pay as you go manner, allowing anyone to integrate these valuable resources their own business or personal worlds.</p>
<h3>History of APIs</h3>
<p>Over the last 14 years of the Internet, companies have been using a new approach to APIs, built on the same technology that drives the web&mdash;HTTP.  Web APIs are not a new, proprietary way of building applications on the Internet, but a way of delivering the vital resources web and mobile applications need, side by side with the same websites that humans consume&mdash;except APIs are raw data, minus the visuals that a human would require, enabling developers to deliver exactly the experience that end users will need.</p>
<p><strong>Delivering On Original Visions of Digital Commerce</strong><br /> This low cost approach to deliver resources on the web has been pioneered by tech giants like SalesForce in delivering the next generation of customer relationship management, and sales in the clouds. We&rsquo;ve also seen web APIs transform world of ecommerce from tech giants like Amazon, and shift auctions online from eBay. The payments needed to transact in this new world of commerce also emerged via APIs from Paypal, and a newer generation of payment API providers like Stripe.</p>
<p><strong>A Social Web</strong><br /> The distributed effect of web APIs allowed for the evolution of a new type of online interaction, dubbed &ldquo;social&rdquo;. Early innovators applied web APIs to digital media such as photos from Flickr, and then quickly was applied to the sharing of Internet links or bookmarks by Delicious. Once these pioneers paved the way, a next generation of social platforms were born with the emergence of Twitter and Facebook. All of these social platforms employed web APIs as the driver for all social interactions via the web, that contributed to their growth and user adoption.</p>
<p><strong>Migrating Compute Into The Cloud</strong><br /> After their success with commerce APIs, Amazon internalize the deployment of APIs in a way that gave birth to how we deploy and scale compute and storage, forever changing how develop applications with the introduction of Amazon Web Services. Amazon started with a dead simple storage API called Amazon S3, then shortly after rolled out the ability to deploy server instances in the cloud via web APIs with Amazon EC2&mdash;providing two of the essential building blocks for building apps online.</p>
<p><strong>Geo-locating In A Digital World</strong><br /> As we were getting our bearings in this new digital world we created for ourselves, the search pioneer Google began innovating in the world of online mapping. Shortly after noticing that users were hacking and extending the JavaScript driven Google Maps, they began designing a web API that would meet the needs of the web and the soon to emerge world of mobile apps&mdash;giving everyone the first in a long line of essential API driven Geo resources we would need to make the web mobile.</p>
<p><strong>Messaging For The Cloud</strong><br /> As the web began its collision with the emerging world of mobile devices, a new breed of API driven messaging resources emerged, first around SMS and voice from Twilio, then evolving standard messaging formats like email, from SendGrid. However it doesn&rsquo;t stop with just extending existing messaging standards via APIs, companies like Context.io are completely redefining how we approach traditional email messaging with their API driven messaging solutions.</p>
<h3>What Makes Web APIs So Appealing?</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-shipping-containers.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The wealth of individual resources has made the world of APIs very appealing to developers, but this approach to deploying very modular, web-based resources was also proven valuable to companies when exposing their own resources, for internal development, extending access to partners, and in some cases making available to the general public and open developers.</p>
<p><strong>Granular Resources</strong><br /> With web APIs you are taking the minimum viable portion of a resource and making available over the Internet. A contact, an image, or any other piece of data, content or programmatic resource, and make it securely accessible on the Internet. This modular, granular approach to defining and providing access to resources allows for the remix, and reuse of resources in a very efficient way across all possible systems, web or mobile applications, and increasingly any Internet connected object.</p>
<p><strong>Distributed Resources</strong><br /> Since web APIs are built using HTTP, the underlying infrastructure of the Internet, they are distributed in nature, and globally scalable&mdash;just like the web. This approach to delivering APIs allow for resources to be accessed internally by systems and applications, across the globe by external groups and partners--any potential consumer with Internet access. Defining digital assets as APIs allow for distributed access, by existing consumers, while ensuring they are immediately available to any future need that may arise.</p>
<p><strong>Agility and Nimbleness</strong><br /> With digital assets defined in such a granular, distributed manner, a new agility begins to emerge. Companies who once took months or years to expose data and content sources, and securely provide access, can now open up access potentially in real-time to company and organization wide resources. APIs are all about access and re-use, allowing companies to save time and money when integrating existing assets into web and mobile apps at speeds they never could imagine before.</p>
<p><strong>Research, Development, And Innovation</strong><br /> With valuable assets securely available on the Internet, all resources are available for research and development, allowing for new types of innovation to occur. APIs are external by nature, establishing an R&amp;D lab of sorts, for companies to experiment with new types of product and services, in an environment that encourages outside participation, establishing a rich environment for new ideas to flourish.</p>
<h3>What Have We Learned?</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-question-mark.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Challenging the top down planning approaches of earlier API movements like SOA, web APIs have produced some valuable lessons in deploying application infrastructure that focuses on simplicity, rapid iterations, and bottom-up, grassroots evolution of how a service oriented architecture is designed, deployed, managed and evolved.  Studying the approaches from API pioneers, as well as the current waves of public API deployments provide numerous lessons that other companies, organizations, and government agencies can learn from. Let&rsquo;s walk through some of the biggest lessons from the world of APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Technology of APIs</strong><br /> Over the last 14 years suite of technological approaches to designing, deploying and operating APIs have won out, not just through standards, but through organic experimentation, proven through success. Modern web APIs start with pragmatic REST, which uses HTTP and follows Roy Fielding's recommendations for making the web not just consumable, but also programmable. To support API interaction, a new data exchange format has emerged&mdash;JSON is the lightweight, preferred data interaction format for API consumers. Finally, to secure APIs, a standard called oAuth has emerged handling not just the identity of application users, but handles the authorization and access of underling resources available via an API.</p>
<p><strong>Business of APIs</strong><br /> The success of web APIs is only partially a technical thing, a large part of web APIs success is driven from their business approaches. We&rsquo;ve learned that simple, clean and centralized consumer portals, with complete documentation, and supporting code are essential to on-boarding, and helping consumer achieve a successful integration. API providers have also established sophisticated communication strategies for their API operations including blogs, active Twitter and other social media accounts, and community forums within their ecosystem and outside them on existing developer communities like Stack Overflow. All of these supporting business elements help ensure the technical operations of an API are known and supported, providing what is needed for consumers to be successful.</p>
<p><strong>Politics of APIs</strong><br /> APIs are not inherently good, bad or neutral when it comes to company operations, partnerships and public access. There are several aspects of the political side of APIs that ensure consumer success, starting but not limited to sensible, flexible terms of service that protect a company's assets, but also allow developers to innovate. API providers throttle access to valuable resources by establishing rate limits, multiple pricing levels, and access tiers for API consumers, allowing for the generation of revenue, but in a way that encourages healthy consumption by integrated applications. The security and reliability of an API also plays a significant role in an APIs overall image, on-boarding process, and access to a platforms API resources. All of these elements provide the political grease that makes API integrations flow, with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/10/the-levers-dials-and-switches-for-your-participation-in-the-api-economy/">many different knobs and levers that can be pulled, loosened, or tightened for the delivering optimal results</a>.</p>
<p><strong>API Design</strong><br /> In the last couple years, leading API practitioners have demonstrated that API design is more art than science. Good API design isn't always about just getting busy coding, and are using mock API interfaces that introduced collaboration between API providers, key stakeholders and ultimately the consumer&mdash;leading to better, more consumable interfaces without the overhead of iterating within a production environment.  In the last year, this has grown to the point where new tools and languages have emerged, which employs markdown based formats that have the potential make the API design process friendlier to non-developer. The evolution of API design is making API design something that potentially anyone can do, which brings the process closer to the problem owners who are looking for solutions to their everyday problems.</p>
<p><strong>API Management</strong><br /> In the web API world, management of API operations is not about governance, but about making assets more accessible, in safe and secure ways, that do protect a providers interests, but also allow for establishment of API operations that encourage integration and innovation. With modern API management tools and approaches, the process of management is more about understanding, than it is about control. API management becomes about having your finger on the pulse of consumers, understanding how they are using resources, enabling providers to identify new trends, features and enforce healthy usage of API resources&mdash;protecting everyone involved from API owners to developers, and the end-users who will be using the resulting websites and applications.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of Evangelism</strong><br /> Every one of the successful API programs today, deploy some sort of outreach as part of their initiative, widely called developer advocacy or evangelism. This type of engagement with API consumers both offline and online is essential to building a strong base of integrations. If nobody knows about an API, and what is possible when you integrate with it, the chances that an API will get used are slim. It doesn't matter how technically sound an API implementation is, if nobody knows about it, it won&rsquo;t get used.</p>
<p><strong>Sensible Business Models</strong><br /> APIs are allowing well established, and new business to evolve their existing business models, while also allowing them to establish entirely new ways of conducting business. External API ecosystems that flourish into R&amp;D labs, allow for potentially safe environment for incubating new business models, increasing the ways that businesses can generate revenue in 2014.</p>
<h3>What Are APIs Delivering?</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-deliver.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>APIs open up multiple channels for distribution of resources, which is the primary reason for their increased usage. Many start-ups tout an API-first development strategy, where they focus first on developing a stack of API resources before they consider developing any web or mobile application. APIs can be platform agnostic, allowing for easily adding of new application channels, devices and other objectives without changing the API.</p>
<p><strong>Websites</strong><br /> Allowing for the development of distributed websites around centralized data and content was the first practical use of web APIs. The modular, and distributed nature allowed for easy syndication of content for providers, and a quick source of rich content for developers and site owners. Early pioneers like Amazon and eBay realized the power of developing armies of resellers for their products and auctions, that allowed anyone to build a website around their valuable resources.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile</strong><br /> With the introduction of iPhone from Apple, the true potential of distributed, modular API driven resources was realized. Developers were able to build apps that consumers wanted, and API driven utilities like Foursquare and Twilio provide the resources they needed, built on top of the recently realized cloud infrastructure, which was also API driven. APIs make resources accessible, but the mobile phone delivers these valuable resources right to where we need them&mdash;in our hands.</p>
<p><strong>Tablet</strong><br /> Building on the success of using APIs to deliver mobile resources, Apple introduced us to the power of the tablet, with the introduction of the wildly successful iPad. Where earlier tablets had failed, the iPad did not&mdash;quite likely this was due to the fact that we didn't have the API driven resources necessary to satisfy customers, as well as the power of the cloud infrastructure to deliver the backend needed. APIs provided the rich content and data necessary to drive the next generation of touch and interactive apps that would emerge via the iPad and following Android and Windows tablets.</p>
<p><strong>Data Analysis &amp; Visualization</strong><br /> With the wealth of data available via the thousands of emerging APIs, developers realized that the distributed nature of APIs allows for remote analysis of data, as well as the visualization of this information via dashboards and embeddable widgets, services and portable web applications. A new wave of &ldquo;big data&rdquo; solutions haleve emerged once a critical mass of APIs were achieved, providing a way of engaging with valuable resources beyond just web and mobile applications.</p>
<p><strong>Internet of Things</strong><br /> As the Internet matures, the desire to connect not just mobile phones, tablets, laptops and computers to the Internet increases, but it has also spread to every object in our everyday lives. The availability of APIs has fueled a new phenomenon call the Internet of Things, which is connecting objects like the thermostat in our homes, our automobiles, and entire cities to the Internet using APIs. APIs aren&rsquo;t just for web and mobile anymore, the web API approach is being used to send and receive content from sensors, cameras, and anything you can imagine in the world around us to API backends, where data can be processed, stored and distributed anywhere online.</p>
<h3>Emerging Trends Enabled By APIs</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-trends.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As API usage expands rapidly into the Internet of Things, other practitioners are exploring new ways to put APIs to use in the the web and mobile applications they already use&mdash;approaches that will enhance the user experience, and increase the quality and reach of API driven resources.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregation</strong><br /> Innovative companies across business sectors ranging from cloud computing to advertising are aggregating APIs allowing for a new breed of APis that allow access to multiple platforms, and enhance or augment existing resources via these new interfaces. Some APIs only go so far when cleaning up data, or matching with other complimentary resources available in the API space&mdash;leaving a huge opportunity for innovation by start-ups, and pushing APIs to deliver even more value to API consumers and their application end-users.</p>
<p><strong>Interoperability &amp; Reciprocity</strong><br /> With much of our personal and business lives moving into the clouds, an a new wave of companies have emerged that allow anyone, even non-developers to migrate content and data between online platforms using APIs. This new approach to system interoperability has evolved from early IT migration processes, providing not just interoperability but reciprocity between multiple platforms, while also empowering end-users to initiate migration between platforms that meet their goals.</p>
<p><strong>Real Time</strong><br /> APIs have helped developed a serious appetite amongst end-users for the delivery information as quickly as possible. Having data, content and other resources instantly in our hands via mobile devices, along with the introduction of new real-time technologies like Websockets and PubSubHubub, has made the web an increasingly real time, 24/7 available world. Either from real time APIs directly from providers, or the increasing number of real time frameworks, applications have become much easier to send and receive valuable API resources that occurs in real time or near real time&mdash;changing the pace of how we consume and produce information.</p>
<h3>Remembering Why It All Works</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-ying-yang.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>With the increasing pace of technology and APIs, it can get easy to get caught up in the complexity of the web, and make similar mistakes to earlier API initiatives, forgetting exactly what made web APIs work in the first place. For web APIs to be sustainable there are a number core elements that API providers and consumers should keep in mind, to make sure all this success we are seeing doesn&rsquo;t fade.</p>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong><br /> The number one reason this whole world of web APIs has taken off is because of simplicity. In most cases web APIs do one thing, and they do it well. Using simple, intuitive URIs to interact with valuable resources. APIs should not be much harder than to load a web page, allowing anyone to be able to put APIs to use. Simplicity in design, deployment, management, monetization, and evangelism should be front and center for all API providers&mdash;without simplicity, web APIs will find themselves along the same path as its predecessor(s).</p>
<p><strong>Easy, Low Cost Access to Resources</strong><br /> Access to resources is what attracts developers to APIs. This new wave of web APIs is putting resources into the reach of developers that once were either impossible, or so costly that innovation would never occur within small businesses and start-ups. Reducing any barriers to entry for API consumers is the hallmark of a modern web API, and even if you require registering, and keys to access APIs, providers should make ease of access a top priority for all APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Working Together (Collaboration)</strong><br /> Simplicity, self-service and access to valuable resources beg for collaboration not just amongst developers, but also between the platform and developer ecosystems. API ecosystems open up new opportunities for collaboration, and have the potential to change culture within a company, allowing it to reach outside of the firewall and experience new ideas. As the number of APIs grow, the opportunities for collaboration between API providers increases as well, allowing for shared reach across multiple developer ecosystems, and the chance to attract developers who need multiple resources to achieve their goals.</p>
<p><strong>Permissive Terms of Service</strong><br /> An API terms of service guide all interactions consumers will have with exposed resources. The purpose of the TOS is not just protect a company's assets from misuse, is it meant to direct consumers in ways that stimulate integration and innovation, while also protecting the interests of end-users. API TOS need to be legalese enough to cover everyone&rsquo;s ass, but also liberal enough to incentivize consumers to integrate with their own business operations.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency In Operations</strong><br /> APIs provide an extremely huge opportunity for innovation around company assets, but it requires a company to invest in being more transparent regarding how it does business. APIs by themselves do not equal transparency, they require a company to share insight into how it operates, and what it is planning as part of the road-map. APIs let sunlight to business operations in ways that can disinfect and change company culture, allowing in the oxygen needed for new ideas to flourish. Transparency is a requirement for any successful API initiative, it is up to you regarding just how much is just right.</p>
<p><strong>A Balanced 3 Legged  Approach</strong><br /> Inherited from the 3 legs of oAuth, a balanced approach to API operations in a way that isn&rsquo;t just centered around the providers objectives, but equally considers API consumers and end-users, is essential. While its easy to focus on the value delivered by API providers, or the innovation of developers, without educated, engaged and trusting end-users any platform will stumble. Compare the three legs of an API platform to a three legged stool, if one is missing or short, the stool will hold nothing and fall over when used.</p>
<h3>What We Need To Do</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/kin-kaia.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>There are two things that I feel are critical to helping guide the API economy, and help prevent us from going down a dark alley or face failure like earlier API efforts like SOA encountered. While there are other illnesses and problems we face, I think that these two areas reflect system illnesses that could prove catastrophic to the entire space.</p>
<p><strong>Respecting Everyone&rsquo;s Privacy</strong><br /> As technologists, developers and platform architecture we MUST respect the privacy of any users who depends on our API pipes. The content, data and other resources that flow through APIs are NOT the new oil. There are plenty of monetization opportunities around this flow of information, but we must respect everyone's privacy in the process. What flows through these API pipes may not mean anything to the platform owner, or the developer integrating with apps, but this information will be very valuable and meaningful to the end-user.</p>
<p><strong>Stop Reinventing the Wheel</strong><br /> There are some amazing API design patterns that already exist in the API space, leaders from Salesforce to Twilio have already defined some of the best patterns that are currently imaginable for common resources like contacts, images, and messages&mdash;with all of these patterns why are we often re-inventing the wheel and designing APIs within walled silos? We need to get better at sharing API definitions, media types and underlying data models with the community. Telling stories around why they are good, how they are being used, and publicly share them in an openly licensed way, so that others can follow our lead. This is why <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist have started <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, to give everyone healthy patterns that they can follow and emulate in their own API operations.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s celebrate how far we've come in 14 years of web APIs, learn from the pioneers who have been around, tell stories about how we are using APIs, publishing and being proud of the work we do, while building for our collective future, and not forgetting the dark matter that holds this amazing space together.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 May 2014</span>
        <p><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-politics.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Terms of service <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/10/the-levers-dials-and-switches-for-your-participation-in-the-api-economy/">guide every aspect of how we provide and consume an APIs</a>&nbsp;that drive&nbsp;our web and mobile applications. As an excercise, lets imagine a future where API terms of service (TOS) are machine readable, and always in alignment with the multiple partner tiers, and the service composition of an API platform.</p>
<p>Right now, the options available to API consumers is organized into service packages, allowing us multiple tiers of access, based upon usage + cost, when registering for and consuming API resources. Imagine if during this process the API TOS were integrated into the registration and account management workflows. Imagine you could fully understand each portion of the API TOS, and be provided with options, instead of a single, rigid level of service.</p>
<p>Currently <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/17/politics-of-apis/">options for API access are throttled across TOS, privacy policy, branding, service level agreements, pricing, and service composition and partner access tiers</a>. I want to explore the possibility that these building blocks could be machine readable, allowing for variances on each aspect of API operations. This scenario would allow for API consumers to prioritize which aspects of operations are most important to them, allowing them to pay more for premium access to API services.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just working through my thoughts on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/17/politics-of-apis/">politics of APIs</a>, expanding on ideas of machine readable terms of service (TOS) introduce to me by Tyler Singletary (<a href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>)&nbsp;of <a href="https://twitter.com/KloutAPI">@KloutAPI,</a> and also a tweet from Antony Falco (<a href="https://twitter.com/antonyfalco">@antonyfalco</a>)&nbsp;of <a href="http://orchestrate.io/">Orchestrate.io</a>&nbsp;about the potential to allow for variances of TOS.</p>
<p>I would love to hear your thoughts on this subject. Am I off in left field, or is this something we should play with more?</p>

<p>I getting ready to heading to Berlin in the morning. I'm scheduled to speak at <a href="http://berlin.apidays.io/">APIDays Berlin</a> on Monday. APIDays is the sister site to #<a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">APIStrat</a>, an event you will always find me at, no matter where it is at in the world.</p>
<p>APIDays has been pushing the conversation around APIs across Europe and the United States for a couple years now. While #APIStrat is focused on larger markets, and bigger events&mdash;APIDays is focused on new markets, and conversations within new business verticals, like the <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">automobile API conversation, in San Francisco this June</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scheduled for the end of the day Monday, so my talk titled &ldquo;The Kin Lane Show&rdquo;, will be a summary of the current state of API space, while also integrating the other talks I will see throughout the day. Something that will helps me fine tune a talk for a local audience and specifically for APIDays Berlin.</p>
<p>Hopefully you already have your tickets, if not you can catch me at the end of May at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">APIDays Mediterranea in Barcelona</a>, and at <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">APIDays San Francisco</a> in June.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 May 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/events/impact/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/ibm-impact-2014/ibm-impact-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spoke on the business of internal APIs at the <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/events/impact/">IBM Impact conference in Las Vegas</a>, this last Tuesday. About 15 people attended my talk, but the conversations I had with folks afterwards, signaled to me that my talk was a success.</p>
<p>I do not expect IBM or the enterprise to listen to my brand of API evangelism, but I&rsquo;m still determined to better understand the collision of the enterprise with the open  world of web APIs. Even if I convert just one or two individuals at any event, my mission was a success.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>Impressed that IBM invited <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> to speak at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23IBMImpact&amp;src=hash">#IBMImpact</a>. Maybe this isn&rsquo;t your father&rsquo;s IBM!</p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>As I walked around the event talking to people I was reminded of how hungry the enterprise is for conversation about the API space that aren&rsquo;t linked to a product or particular company. As soon as people realize I have no sales pipeline, and I&rsquo;m genuinely trying to understand the space, and help them be successful, the tone always shifts dramatically.</p>
<p>You can find my <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/talks/ibm/impact-2014/" target="_blank">slide deck for the talk on Github</a>, unfortunately its in my minimalist style, so you need to have my narration&mdash;maybe I&rsquo;ll work on longer post to summarize what I covered during the talk. I&rsquo;ll have more thoughts on my experience at IBM Impact in Vegas, but will publish as separate posts across <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-enterprise.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been studying the API space exclusively for the last four years, and have worked hard to try and understand the space by studying the <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">history of APIs</a>, and as a result I can confidently say we are smack dab in the middle of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/17/what-is-the-next-phase-of-apis/">what I consider to be an enterprise phase</a>.</p>
<p>In 2013 and 2014 I&rsquo;ve seen the enterprise across multiple business sectors turn their attention to this curiosity called the web API. So why is the enterprise so interested in APIs? Many technologists from the enterprise claim that it is no difference than their own earlier SOA efforts, but there has to be more under the hood, that is attracting the enterprise, beyond just a shiny new label, API&mdash;so what are they?</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - Keep things small, modular and intuitive</li>
<li><strong>Access</strong> - You should be widening access to your resources, not ever limiting</li>
<li><strong>Openness</strong> - While not everything should be 100% open, be as open as possible</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong> - Provide insight into operations and your roadmap allowing consumers to operate in alignment</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> - Two way communication between you and your consumers</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Protect the privacy of your consumers</li>
<li><strong>Ownership</strong> - Be open to alternative licensing and ownership of content and data that is favorable to consumers</li>
<li><strong>Legal</strong> - Be as open as you can be with copyright, patents and trademark in API initiatives</li>
<li><strong>Terms</strong> - Establish terms of use that favor your business, but also the interests of consumers</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> - Acknowledge the monetization needs of your consumers</li>
<li><strong>Quantify</strong> - Define and understand how digital resources are being consumed</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're looking at the web API phenomenon purely through a technical lens, as many SOA practitioners do, you will not even see most of these characteristics&mdash;they are irrelevant to your tech driven goals.  In my opinion this <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/10/soa-vs-api--the-humans-win/">humanization of a company&rsquo;s digital resources</a>, which historically have been locked up, defined and controlled by IT gatekeepers, is the single most important lesson for the enterprise when it comes to web APIs.</p>
<p>In 2014, as you are planning your API strategy, don't make the mistake in seeing APIs as purely a tool in the SOA toolbox, as they were over 10 years ago. Long ago web APIs jumped out of the enterprise petri dish, experienced the oxygen available within the public sphere and developed some life giving characteristics that will be critical to the enterprise surviving and thriving in the coming years.</p>
<p>I will be talking at <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/events/impact/">IBM Impact in Las Vegas</a> next week on this topic.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/04/25/a-rare-beast-in-government-the-write-api/">A Rare Beast In Government, The Write API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">25 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/how-why/introduction"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/we-the-people/we_the_people.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The number of APIs in government has grown significantly in the last couple of years, increasing access to public data, potentially driving the private sector to build web and mobile apps around government resources data. Even with this growth in API deployment and resulting app development, this movement has been severely handicapped by one aspect&mdash;99% of these APis are read only, you cannot write data to government via APIs.</p>
<p>APIs being a two way street is one of those subtle, but very important aspects of API operations that can define whether an API initiative will be success or not. Since government is so risk averse, most entities are afraid of what can happen when they launch APIs, and completely terrified around what will happen with an API that people can write data to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/09/what-is-next-for-the-us-government-api-strategy-getting-technical/">pushing for more read / write APis in government for some time now</a>, and for the first time I'm seeing the potential for things to change, with a <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/write-api-beta-testing">new beta API project from the We The People API</a>. I couldn't think of a better program to test a writable API for, than We The People&mdash;pushing the democratic powers of web APIs.</p>
<p>First, what is We The People?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We the People is the White House's petitions platform -- giving people a new way to petition the government. The way it works is pretty simple: People can create or sign petitions on WhiteHouse.gov. If it gets enough support (i.e. signatures), it will receive an official response. And with more than 13 million users, it's been a big success.</em></p>
<p>Second, why an API?</p>
<p>An API opens up the petition platform to exist within any website, application and mobile applications. A read API allows for content to display on any site or app, and a write API allows for participation in the petition process via any site or app&mdash;changing the dynamics of the petition process, moving it off of just .gov websites, ultimately evolving how our government operates.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/we-the-people/we-the-people-write-api-beta.png" alt="" width="575" /></p>
<p><strong>Testing The Waters With A Beta Phase</strong><br /> With any web software you need a beta phase, allowing trusted users to play with and debug an implementation, and this is what the team behind the We The People API are doing. They are using Github as a collaborative platform during the beta phase to test the write API, fix issues and squash bugs, and improve documentation ahead of the public release.</p>
<p><strong>Measuring And Throttling Write API Access</strong><br /> Counter to popular opinion, not all APIs are open and publicly available by default. We The People requires you to request access to the API, and limits the number of API requests available for each API key. This type of access is essential to establishing a trusted layer of users and applications, that will be writing data to the We The People platform, through the API.</p>
<p><strong>Collaborative Documentation</strong><br /> The We The People API provides complete documentation for the read and write API methods, allowing developers to learn about the interface and how to integrate into their applications. As part of the beta process they are looking for assistance from developers in improving and evolving the available documentation.</p>
<p><strong>A Central Role For Github</strong><br /> The We The People API team is relying on Github for managing code related to the platform, but also relying on it for managing collaborative changes to the API documentation, and using Github issue management to handle all feedback for the API beta cycles--making the deployment of this API a social process.</p>
<p><strong>Politics Of API Usage</strong><br /> Along with the other essential building blocks, the We The People API team provides a terms of service and privacy policy to help set the tone for what is expected of developers who are integrating their web and mobile applications with the API, providing a few of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/10/the-levers-dials-and-switches-for-your-participation-in-the-api-economy/">knobs and levers for managing the political aspects of a read / write API</a>.</p>
<p><strong>An API Blueprint For Government To Follow</strong><br /> I&rsquo;m super excited about the <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/write-api-beta-testing">We The People Write API beta</a>. There are no other write APIs in the federal government beyond the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint">IRS modernized e-file system</a>&mdash;there are some others that allow for minimal interactions, and open tooling at the city government level, but a simple write API at the White House level, is a big deal. To realize the full potential of an API in government, it has to have write capabilities, and despite what some believe, write capabilities should not be available to everyone&mdash;you should demonstrate that you will bring value to the platform.</p>
<p>The We The People API is a blueprint for how APIs can be done in government. The platform started with a basic read API, that focuses on doing one thing, and makes sure it does it well. Then once they have a handle on that, they have moved into allowing developers the ability to write to the API, during a very controlled beta phase.</p>
<p>I will be watching the We The People API process closely, and work hard to craft stories ,and help solidify it as a blueprint that other agencies can follow. The write API represents a significant shift in open data and API efforts in government. The overall government lifecycle is not a one way street, where government just dictates to citizens, so there is no reason government APIs should be a one way street&mdash;adding write capabilities to all government APIs is essential to getting to not just a healthy government API ecosystem, but also a healthy overall API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-planning.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I just finished up participating in an API specification session for <a href="http://www.greenbuttondata.org/">Green Button</a> data with <a href="https://www.sce.com">Southern California Edison (SCE)</a>, <a href="http://www.sdge.com/">San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (SDG&amp;E)</a>, and <a href="http://www.pge.com/">Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E)</a>.</p>
<p>The discussion at one point during the last day was around &ldquo;chunking&rdquo; of huge data sets that a provider wants to allow for download over http. The group has been talking about scenarios for how this will work, and after over an hour they are getting to some pretty edge case scenarios surrounding &ldquo;chunking&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As I listen, I can&rsquo;t help but thinking about he pros and cons of upfront planning vs. iterating on your API over time. Are they planning for scenarios that will never happen, and building in development time for use cases that may never become a reality? They know their data and industry best, so I am not educated enough to make a determination, but it doesn't stop me from having these thoughts.</p>
<p>I understand that large companies, like wihtin the utility inudstry, have to plan as much as they can, as they operate in a pretty unforgiving environment when it involves physical integrations, government regulations, and other constraints in the industry. Even with this understanding, I think some larger institutions are very used to planning, and covering every possible scenario that they can think of, and in the process, spending unnecessary resources, and also limiting any positive unknowns from occurring.</p>
<p>Developers from the open API space definitely have to better understand planning, and doing their due diligence before just leaping, but I also think the enterprise will have even more challenges when it comes to letting go and realizing the innovation that can occur around APIs. That you can cover your ass by considering the obvious negative scenarios, then building quality management tooling and processes, and identify other negative scenarios in realtime--when you actually have the data evidence to support.</p>
<p>With too heavy of a governance hand, you might just end up re-living many of the suffocating aspects we experienced in the SOA world.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.byu.edu/wiki/display/SOA/Web+Services+Programmer+Documentation" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/brigham-young-university.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking on <a title="education APIs" href="http://education.apievangelist.com/">education</a> and <a title="university APIs" href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">university</a> APIs for a while now, but after kicking off some work on the <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/">FAFSA API prototype</a>, and preparing a response for to the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/04/16/2014-08649/request-for-information-on-the-use-of-apis-in-higher-education-data-and-student-aid-processes">request for information (RFI) on the use of APIs in higher education data and student aid process</a>, I'm ramping up the time I&rsquo;m spending on education related APIs.</p>
<p>APIs in higher education is also one of the areas <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist are partnering, to help define what the API landscape looks like across higher education institutions, and as I do with other business sectors, we are looking to stimulate the API conversation amongst existing leaders from the space&mdash;online, and offline at as many events as we can.</p>
<p>In support of all of this, I went through the API efforts of 10 institutions I&rsquo;m currently monitoring, to see what was new, reacquainting myself with what each of the institutions were up to. My primary goal was to establish a list of the common services that other universities could offer, based upon these existing API leaders, and I was well on my to compiling a pretty robust list, until I got to Brigham Young University (BYU), and I was blown out of the water.</p>
<p>BYU wins the API deployment game within a university with the <a href="https://developer.byu.edu/wiki/display/SOA/Web+Services+Programmer+Documentation" target="_blank">261 web services they have listed in their registry</a>. Every aspect of university operation is represented as a web service, and as you scan down the list, and you look at the XSDs, you realize how much work went into their API stack. There are definitely some interesting things going on at <a href="http://webservices.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>, <a href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a> and in <a href="http://apps.usos.edu.pl/developers/api/">Poland</a> around university APIs, but BYU blows everyone away.</p>
<p>I will go through the list of web service from BYU, clean up a little, and use to seed a general list of potential services that other universities could use when planning their own API program. When I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/11/common-building-blocks-of-cloud-apis/">profiled the cloud computing API space</a>, Amazon Web Services has such a complete list of APIs, I was able to use them as the starting point for a cloud computing API blueprint. In the same way, I think BYU list of services is so complete, it provides an extremely complete blueprint for other higher education institutions to potentially follow.</p>

<p>The ReliefWeb API follows a trend of organizations realizing not just the potential of APIs for delivering content to mobile applications, but also the benefits of opening up publicly. As the site states:</p>
<blockquote><em>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) originally built the ReliefWeb API to power a mobile version of the ReliefWeb website.</em></blockquote>
<p>Since then they have normalized the interfaces for public consumption, hoping that &ldquo;developers can build tools that increase exposure for valuable content and facilitate analysis for better decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ReliefWeb API provides seven valuable API endpoints:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Discovery</strong> - Providing discovery, navigability and insight into other APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Reports</strong> - Content API of updates, headlines and maps available on ReliefWeb.</li>
<li><strong>Jobs</strong> - Job offers available on ReliefWeb.</li>
<li><strong>Trainings</strong> - Training opportunities available via ReliefWeb.</li>
<li><strong>Countries</strong> - Countries from Reliefweb.</li>
<li><strong>Disasters</strong> - Disasters tracked on as part of ReliefWeb.</li>
<li><strong>Sources</strong> - Sources of information available on ReliefWeb.</li>
</ul>
<p>The design of the API is pretty well thought out, providing some common, as well as some forward thinking technical elements:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Detailed information about all API endpoints, including content types, versions, data model, including full text and interactive version using Swagger.</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia</strong> - Control links facilitate paging, deep cross-linking of content allows navigating between related resources, and all resources can be reached by drilling down from the top level of the API at http://api.rwlabs.org.</li>
<li><strong>Caching</strong> - Uses Cache-Control headers to point out how often ReliefWeb recommends checking for updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://reliefweb.int" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/reliefweb/reliefweb-syra.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I started playing around making some calls and enjoyed the way the API flows, and excited about the potential. I do have some critique of the implementation, with the hope of influencing their roadmap.</p>
<p><strong>Side Project</strong><br /> The API initiative has a very side project feel. Its under /help/ in the address, and I'd say 90% of the projects I&rsquo;ve seen deployed in this way go away&mdash;this will affect developer perspective. While I understand most API projects are often underfunded side projects, you should work to hide this. Launch at developer.reliefweb.int and give the portal its own navigation, and make a link to developers area prominent in footer or header of main ReliefWeb site&mdash;instilling confidence in API consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong><br /> The API documentation is complete. It has all the relevant information, it just feels fragmented, and needs some UX love. The Swagger API docs could be made to be a little more beautiful, flowing and integrated with the rest of the docs. The age of link to interactive explorer is gone, your entire doc experience should be interactive.</p>
<p><strong>Key Things Up</strong><br /> I love that I can just start playing with API, without registration, but I&rsquo;d much rather have ReliefWeb in tune with how the API is being used, and including usage patterns into its roadmap and future API design. Requiring self-service registration and API key to use isn't going to lock up the data, it will allow you to better understand how endpoints are being consumed, bottlenecks, and common usage patterns. This will all go a long way to helping evolve the API roadmap and understand ReliefWeb API consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Building Blocks</strong><br /> Much like I state above about it feeling like a side project, most of the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">essential API building blocks</a> are there, but their are really fragmented. There are FAQs on multiple pages, docs spread across multiple pages, and support paths aren't super clear. Overall the portal and supporting building blocks just need some UX love to make sure it flows better for on boarding new developers, as well as supporting existing ones.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Forward</strong><br /> It is always hard to critique new APIs from governmental or non-profit organizations, because I'm just happy to see any API come out the door. This means the iteration cycles start, and things will only get better (potentially).</p>
<p>I could recommend <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">other building blocks</a> like code samples, idea and application showcase and social elements like usage of Github and Twitter, but I know they are just getting going and these things will come.</p>
<p>Overall I&rsquo;m excited about the potential around the ReliefWeb API, that the organization has seen the benefits of APIs in their own mobile strategy, but also understands the potential of opening up these resources to the public.</p>
<p>Seeing deployments like the ReliefWeb API remind me that we can truly tackle many of the big problems we face in the world, rather than many of the stupid, first world problem API solutions and applications we see out of Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been involved in a lot of conversations lately around turning government forms into APIs. Which seems like a great idea, right up until the part where I&rsquo;m thinking about the original workflow represented by many legacy forms, and realize that maybe this form was a bad idea to begin with.</p>
<p>If I develop an API for a form, and the original form all by itself is a bad idea, am I just making a bad idea worse, by attaching an API to it? I'd say yes!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like this will be true in all situations. I think APIs will allow us to hopefully break free of what the original intent of a form was, explore new opportunities for gathering and managing data, and changing the concept of what a form is.</p>
<p>Even with the potential, I can&rsquo;t help but think APIs on forms may not be good in all scenarios. Then again, this isn&rsquo;t just limited to forms, before we attach an API to anything, we should probably think&mdash;is this a good idea?</p>

<p>The first consumer of all of my APIs, including my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a> is me. I develop my APIs first for my use, and only recently have decided to make available to the public. So when I sat down to create my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/14/service-composition-for-my-screen-capture-api/">service composition for my APIs</a>, I needed to figure out what I was going to do about my internal consumption.</p>
<p>My first instinct was that I didn't need to include my internal API consumption alongside my partner and public API consumption. I quickly changed my tune as I realized that it was going to be important that I monitor my own API usage in the exact same ways I would partners or public consumers.</p>
<p>I need to better understand how I consume my own APIs, identify security breaches or just unhealthy ways I&rsquo;m consuming my own API resources. I've seen too many APIs like Instagram and even Tesla get burned by not having the proper management layer on their own internally consumed APIs--allowing hackers to get through doorways that weren't monitored.</p>
<p>While my internal API usage won't be billed as it will with my partner, retail or wholesale API consumers, it will be tracked, limited and analyzed alongside the other target API consumption groups.</p>
<p>I need to understand how my API resources are being consumed, and this includes my own usage. This is a very important lesson for all of us API providers to understand, helping us see the complete picture of how APIs are put to use.</p>

<p>The biggest impact APIs will have at your company will be the internal, cultural change regarding how you do business. We are in the middle of an explosion of APIs, and while there are many new public APIs emerging, the majority of growth is coming from the deployment of internal APIs.</p>
<p>There is a lot that companies can learn from the open API movement over the last fourteen years, with many <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks</a>, and healthy practices that can be applied when internally deploying APIs.</p>
<p>This is a topic I will be exploring on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, and at the <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/events/impact/">IBM Impact conference at the Venetian in Las Vegas, NV</a>&mdash;April 27th through May 1st. The abstract from my talk, titled "Business of Internal APIs&rdquo; is:</p>
<blockquote><em>The largest area of growth in the last couple years of APIs is internally within the enterprise. There are numerous lessons that can be extracted from the world of public APIs, and applied internally within any company, helping increase agility, efficiency, while also helping develop new business lines. When it comes to APIs, the secret to success isn&rsquo;t all about technology, and this session will help introduce you to the business of internal APIs, extracted from the approach of leaders in the space.</em></blockquote>
<p>In my experience there are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/10/soa-vs-api--the-humans-win/">fundamental elements that make APIs successful, where more classic approaches like service oriented architecture (SOA)</a> fall short. When companies are deploying APIs for internal consumption, you have to consider elements like self-service access, up to date API docs, code samples, and the human elements, that have made public API deployments successful.</p>
<p>Even though internal APIs consumers will have some unique needs that your partner or public API consumers won't, there will also be many similar patterns across your internal, partner and public API customers that you will need to leverage. If you can&rsquo;t be in Vegas at the end of the month to hear me talk, just tune into API Evangelist and I&rsquo;ll make sure I publish everything online for consumption by all my readers.</p>

        <p><a href="https://addb.absolutdrinks.com/docs/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/absolut/absolut-vodka.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>If you read my blog regularly, you know I am constantly pushing the boundaries of how I see the API space, and sometimes my ramblings can be pretty out there, but API Evangelist is how I work through these thoughts out loud, and hopefully bring them down to a more sane, practical level that everyone can understand.</p>
<p>My crazy vision for the day centers around <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stack</a> composition, as beautiful as the <a href="https://addb.absolutdrinks.com/docs/">Absolut Drinks Database API</a>. Ok, before you can even begin to get up to speed with my crazy rant, you need to be following some of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">my rants around using virtual cloud containers like we are seeing from docker, AWS and OpenShift</a>, and you need to watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXk1dvLKl-U">video from APIStrategy &amp; Practice about Absolut Drink Databse API deployment</a>.</p>
<p><em>Ok, you up to speed? Are you with me now?</em></p>
<p>Today, as I was playing around with the deployment of granular API resources using AWS CloudFormations, I was using their CloudFormer tool, that allows me to browse through ALL of my AWS cloud resources (ie. DNS, EC2 Servers, S3 Storage, RDS Databases), and assemble them into a CloudFormation Templates, which is just a JSON definition of this stack I&rsquo;m going to generate.</p>
<p>Immediately I think of the presentation from Absolut, and how they spent years assembling the image and video parts and pieces that went into the 3500 drinks they wanted available via their API, for developers to use when developing interactive cocktail apps. They had 750 images, and video clips, with a combination of 30K mixing steps, that went into the generation of the 3500 drink combinations. * mind blown *</p>
<p>Now give me this same approach but for composing virtual API stacks, instead of cocktails. With this approach you could define individual API resources such as <a href="http://products.apievangelist.com/">product API</a> or <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a>. These are all independent API resources, with open source server and client side code, openly licensed interface via <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, and virtual container definitions for both AWS CloudFormations and OpenShift.</p>
<p>Imagine if I have hundreds of high value, individual API resources available to me when composing a virtual stack. I could easily compose exactly the stack my developers need, composed of new and existing API resources. I wouldn&rsquo;t be restricted to building directly on top of existing data stores or APIs, I could <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/16/external-api-deployments-using-sync-one-possible-future-of-government-api-deployments/">deploy external API deployments that depend on sync to stay up to date</a>, providing the performance levels I demand from my API stack--I could mix virtual API stacks, like I would a cocktail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyhoooo, that is my rant for now. I&rsquo;ll finish doing the work for deploying AWS CloudFormation and OpenShift containers for my screen capture API, rounding of all the architectural components I outlined in my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/an-operational-harness-for-my-screen-capture-api/">API operational harness</a>, and then rant some more.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading my rant. I hope it made some sense! ;-)</p>

<p>I am evolving my own approach to deploying my API resources, and I needed an important sounding name for it, so came up with &ldquo;operational harness&rdquo; over a couple pints of IPAs. Ok, so what do I mean when I say operational harness?</p>
<p>Based upon the way that I evolve my stories, I evolve my API projects in real-time with the help of Github. For my screen capture API I will be focusing on delivering four separate architectural pieces:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Open Source Version -</strong> An open source, server implementation of my screen capture API, which will PHP initially with other languages next.</li>
<li><strong>API Service -</strong> A publicly accessible, cloud version of the screen capture API, allowing users to a certain amount of calls in a specific time frame before they are charged a per call rate, depending on their service their. </li>
<li><strong>API Containers - </strong>OpenShift and AWS CloudFormation version of the screen capture API for rapid deployment in cloud environment.</li>
<li><strong>Wholesale Service - </strong>A wholesale version of the screen capture that a partner can pay me to deploy and / or manage in mine or theirs cloud environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>I call this my operational harness because I will be operating live instances of these components, scaling as I need in the cloud, but will also be maintaining the open source version, and container versions on Github, while also supporting wholesale deployment. &nbsp;My definition will act as a sort of harness holding together all the architectural pieces of the screenshot API, but also in sync with other utility APIs I will be deploying--helping guide me as I push it all forward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m enjoying putting together my strategy around my own API platform. It gives me some good material to work through for stories here on the blog, and helps me push forward with new approaches to API deployment, like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">deploying and scaling in virtual containers</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">providing wholesale access to resources</a>.</p>

<p>I look at a lot of API developers areas in my work, and the first sign I see that nobody is home behind an API, is that their blog is out of date.</p>
<p>I found myself at the <a href="http://developer.espn.com/blog">ESPN developer center</a> last night, clicked on the blog, which has a great tag line of &ldquo;API-focused musings and rambling&rdquo;, but alas hasn't been updated in over a year.</p>
<p>Your API developer blog posts do not have to be anything master planned, and should just be thoughts from the daily life of running your API. A little effort goes a long way on your API developer blog, and when it becomes out of date, it also will send a strong signal to developers&mdash;nobody is home, don&rsquo;t use this API.</p>
<p>Make sure your API-focused musing and ramblings occur more than once very year, I know that personally I need it daily, but maybe you need it a little less frequent. ;-)</p>

<p>Its not often I find myself referencing Cisco when it comes to shedding light on interesting practices for the API space, but today is not your usual day.</p>
<p>At some point yesterday, I found myself at cisco.com, and I stumbled across their <a href="http://socialmedia.cisco.com/">social page</a>, which gives equal real estate to their blog, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Youtube channel, as well as highlights from their community forum.</p>

<p>I like the idea of having a page like this for API providers. It helps you establish a single page, that can act as a one-stop shop for getting information about what is going on within an API community.</p>
<p>From a planning perspective it also helps providers understand they need to have more than one channel when it comes to providing API support via social channels.</p>
<p>Cisco&rsquo;s social media page is a pretty basic example, but I think a potentially powerful one that API providers can follow when organizing their own social platform, for their own API communities.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-external.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I just wrote up a piece about how to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/api-driven-backend-for-apps-using-orchestrateio/">deploy an API driven application backend using Orchestrate.io,</a> and wrote a piece last week on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/14/liberate-government-data-by-deploying-web-apis-with-solr/">API deployment using Solr and government data</a>. After writing about both of these approaches, I can't shake the thought that external, API driven approaches like this will become commonplace in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>Both the approach using Solr, and the other using Orchestrate.io, identify that data is available via a machine readable data dump and even an API, but neither solution provide the simple web API access that would make application development easy.</p>
<p>In both these stroies, 18F and Orchestrate.io are both looking to just get the job done, achieving their development goals--in one case deploy an API of federal business opportunities, and the other is to build a web application that will make browsing super hero characters easier.</p>
<p>Granted these two scenarios have radically different outcomes, but both share a common approach to meeting their goals:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/api-driven-backend-for-apps-using-orchestrateio/">Orchestrate.io</a></strong> - Uses Orchestrate.io to extract, store and normalize data from the Marvel API, making it much more accessible, searchable and usable in their MarvelousDB web application</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/08/18f-shows-what-is-possible-in-government-with-fbopen-api/">FBOpen</a></strong> - Uses Solr to mount and index business opportunities with the federal government in an XML dump, then deliver a web API so they can build the web interface for FBOpen, but also provide an open source API that anyone can use as is, or deploy on their own infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these approaches are all about making the data and content they need for web and mobile apps, easily accessible via a simple API. Both of these projects acknowledge the data source they have to work with doesn&rsquo;t meet their exact requirements, but for very different reasons. One project uses open source software to tackle their problems, while the other uses the latest cloud services to provide a solution&mdash;both get the job done.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there will be one formula for this type of development that will work in all scenarios, but I think the pattern of extracting the data you need via a data dump or an API, and deploying an external API stack, independent of where you get the data, will be a pattern that can be re-used. This is especially ture in our federal government, where I think much of the innovation needs to occur adjacent to the agency who produces and manages valuable data and content resources, estlabishing API driven, public / private sector partnerships.</p>
<p>I envision a healthier API ecosystem where the government, and the private sector both encourage the re-purposing, and wholesale distribution of content and data, opening up a much more federated approach to delivering the resources we need to build both public, and private sector web and mobile applications.</p>

<p>I'm <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/">increasing my coverage of hypermedia APIs in 2014</a>, as we move from discussion to concrete hypermedia implementations in the wild.

<p>I'll keep tracking on other examples of hypermdia APIs in the wild, and see if we can't begin shedding light on some of the better implementations out there, and see about getting some of these providers to discuss their API developer strategies at <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@APIStrat</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/APIdaysGlobal">@APIdaysGlobal.</a>&nbsp;If you know of any other examples, please let me know.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/api-driven-backend-for-apps-using-orchestrateio/">API Driven Backend For Apps Using Orchestrate.io</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">15 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://orchestrate.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/orchestrate-io/Orchestrate_small-logo-600x124.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There is a great <a href="http://orchestrate.io/blog/2014/04/08/explore-the-marvel-universe-with-orchestrate/">post over on the Orchestrate.io blog about how they deployed a backend for the MarvelousDB app</a>, using data from the <a href="http://developer.marvel.com/">Marvel API</a>, allowing you to explore the world of Marvel comic book characters, through a simple web interface</p>
<p>As developers often face with valuable API resources, the Marvel API leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to available interfaces, data access, and rate limit restrictions. This is common with new APIs, where it takes time to understand <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/10/the-levers-dials-and-switches-for-your-participation-in-the-api-economy/">the right levers and dials to turn, that will make the API more usable</a> by developers.</p>
<p>Even with these challenges, the Orchestrate team wanted to build the <a href="http://marvelousdb.com/">MarvelousDB</a> so they could easily browse the world of Marvel comic book characters, putting the Marvel API to use, but also showing what is possible when using Orchestrate.io. The result is a great example of dynamically building a backend from API resources, in a way that delivers the access and performance you need.</p>
<p><a href="http://marvelousdb.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/orchestrate-io/marvelous-db.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>To deliver the MarvelousDB the project employs <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/orchestrate">Orchestrate.js</a>, <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> for templating, and <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/q">Q for async operations</a>. Using the Marvel API, they pull the data they needed to drive the app, pulling it into Orchestrate.io, giving them the data model and performance they needed, but also adding in capabilities like full text search on top of the data&mdash;something that isn&rsquo;t available from the Marvel API alone.</p>
<p>MarvelousDB is an great example of what is possible via the API driven, <a href="http://orchestrate.io/">database as a service platform Orchestrate.io</a>, but is also a great model to follow when developing web or mobile applications that depend on APIs. Sometimes APIs aren&rsquo;t structured exactly as we need, and we can use platforms like Orchestrate.io, to well&hellip;orchestrate exactly the backend experience we need to get the job done.</p>

<p>I maintain an active list of online services I depend on for my business, using Evernote.  Each month I spend an hour or two maintaining this list, to make sure it is complete and actively change my logins when appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I saw the recent Heartbleed SSL situation as an opportunity to move forward some of my IT practices, including <a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/2014/04/12/downloading-1password-from-agilebits/">using 1Password to manage all of my accounts</a>, and better profiling which APIs I'm consuming. This gave me an opportunity to update my list of APIs that I depend on, adding about 4 or 5 new ones.</p>

<p>I depend on these APIs to run <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>,&nbsp;as well as support the other research and consulting that I do.  Some of these services I pay for, some of them I use for free. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I depend on a lot of APIs, partly because this is my game, I&rsquo;m an API Evangelist, but it is also because APIs provide me with the data and resources I need to operate.</p>
<p>Tracking on the APIs I depend is a regular part of my IT strategy, and eventually I am going to publish this as a public page on my websites--showcasing what APIs have done for my business.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-composer.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I now have a pretty simple <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a>. You can pass it a URL and it gives you back a PNG image file of that website. Meeting my definition of a simple utility API. I use this API in my own platform, capturing what websites and applications look like for reference in stories, and other content.</p>
<p>I want to make this valuable utility API available to a wider audience now. I need to compose some tiers of access to my screen capture API, that makes sense to my business goals and how it will be consumed by a variety of users. So far I&rsquo;ve come up with five levels of access to my API:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Private / Internal </strong>- This is where my API is consumer currently, internally my own systems. I need this tier to be unlimited use, no charge, but still tracking on how I am consuming the screen capture API so I can evaluate along with all my other service levels.</li>
<li><strong>Private / Partner - </strong>I have partners who can make use of my screen capture API, I want to offer them special access to my resource, but I still want to track on how they are using the resource.</li>
<li><strong>Public / Free -</strong> To help attract new developers to my screen capture API I want to make open to the public, all you have to do is sign up for a key, and you can make a certain amount of calls in an hour or day, I haven't decided how much yet.</li>
<li><strong>Public / Retail - </strong>Once a user hits a certain amount of screen capture API calls I want to be able to charge a certain rate per call, allowing consumers to use as much as they want, but cover my operational costs, while making a little money on top.</li>
<li><strong>Public / Wholesale -</strong> I also want to be able to sell wholesale instances of the API either deployed within my infrastructure or someone else&rsquo;s. A company might want access to the screen capture API as part of their stack, but do not have the time to deploy internally.</li>
</ul>
<p>That represents the five separate ways I want to allow access to my screen capture API. Now I can <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/12/moving-beyond-my-basic-3scale-api-infrastructure-plan/">configure my 3Scale API infrastructure</a>, define this exact service composition, and the API will handle the rest. When new users sign-up I will route them into one of these service tiers, and manage their access accordingly.</p>
<p>After I get my API management layer configured, I will have to craft a pricing page to educate new users about what type of access is available. In addition to being a post on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, you can find the story of my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API over at the research project</a> I&rsquo;ve setup over on Github.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apache-solr/apache-solr-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/08/18f-shows-what-is-possible-in-government-with-fbopen-api/">reviewed the deployment the FBOpen API the other day</a>, which is a simple API resource of&nbsp;business&nbsp;opportunities with the U.S. Federal Government. An interesting aspect of the FBOpen implementation was that <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a> used <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a> to deploy the API layer.</p>
<p>Solr is an <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/">open source search tool developed by the Apache Software Foundation</a>, which can take any document store and easily generate a simple, yet pretty powerful web API&mdash;opening up access to content, without costly infrastructure. I showcased how the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/20/api-search-endpoint-using-solr/">Free Law Project launched the Court Opinion API, using Solr</a>, opening up access to archives of legal documents from across the country.</p>
<p>18F took XML dumps of business opportunities from <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/">FBO.gov</a>, then deployed Apache Solr as the API layer. You can <a href="https://github.com/18f/fbopen">download or fork 18F&rsquo;s FBOpen API</a>, and deploy the API in your own infrastructure. This provides a pretty interesting blueprint for how government can easily open up data, then launch an API for developers to build on top of.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking that government data dumps, plus web API deployed using Solr, plus interactive documentation deployed via Github, combined with frictionless API access via api.data.gov or 3Scale, open licensing and terms of use&mdash;all sounds like a pretty health formula for open, reusable government API infrastructure.</p>
<p>Along with other healthy patterns for API design, deployment, management and evangelism I find out in the API space, I think what 18F has done with the FBOpen API, needs highlighting. I think government data plus web API using Solr is a recipe I&rsquo;d like to see used across all government projects.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-fist.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>After the recent heartbleed security fiasco, I&rsquo;m spending my weekend going through <a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/2014/04/12/which-online-services-do-i-depend-on/">my list of online services that I depend on</a>, changing my passwords, and along the way I&rsquo;m going to reclaim as much of my domain as I can.</p>
<p>I will be <a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/2014/04/12/reclaim-profile-for-each-service-i-depend-on/">asking some questions of each online service</a>, questions like, why do I use this service? does this service have an API? Questions that will help me establish a profile of that service, to better understand how I use it, and whether there is any valuable content or information I should be organizing in a better way.</p>
<p>I produce a lot of content each day, and on the surface it seems like I maintain control over most of this, but in reality my content resides in online services like Twitter, LinkedIn, and other places that I frequent daily.</p>
<p>I do a pretty good job of centrally managing the blog content I generate each day. I have a central CMS where I create my blog entries, and then syndicate to my network of 60+ Github repositories, that use Github Pages + Jekyll.</p>
<p>When it comes to my social media streams, I do a very poor job of maintaining control over my network. I do not store my Tweets, Facebook, Linked or other social streams anywhere. I don&rsquo;t centrally sync my network of friends and business contact, until recently. I now have a central CRM alongside my blog CMS, but I&rsquo;m just getting started there.</p>
<p>Overall, there is just a lot of content I generate on the Internet, and in addition to understanding my online footprint, to make sure it is secure, I want to make sure I maintain as much control over the intellectual exhaust I generate each day, as I can. I want all my messages, contacts, streams and media to have the widest possible reach, across the latest online services, but I also want to make sure they are organized and stored in a central place that I control.</p>
<p>You will hear me say the phrase &ldquo;<a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/index.html">Reclaim Your Domain</a>&rdquo; a lot in the future. I think this is the evolution of API Evangelist, beyond the business of APIs, and more into the politics of APIs, and helping people understand why APIs are important for orchestrating your online world, keeping yourself safe and secure, but also establishing the greatest control over the value you generate online each day.</p>

<p>Over ten years ago I learned the hard away about my domain. I purchased <a href="http://kinlane.com">kin lane.com</a> from a website hosting provider I found online, and after they drained over 1K from my bank account for a simple $10.00 website and domain purchase, they proceeded to squat on my domain for almost two years. Eventually I got my domain back, but it taught me some serious lessons about navigating this new online world we were creating for ourselves.</p>
<p>Fast-forward ten years, and I&rsquo;ve not just learned a lot more about operating online, I have generated quite a bit of content, and value within my domain, giving me even more reason to protect not just my domain, but my brand. I produce a lot of content online, in the form of Tweets, blog posts, and other online exhaust from my daily life as the API Evangelist, and it is in my best interest to control as much of this content as I can.</p>
<p>While I have my online brand to protect, and overall I have a heightened awareness around my online persona, this is something everyone should learn about. You may not have a valuable blog, online portfolio or other valuable online assets, but eventually you might. No matter who you are online, you should work to understand where your content, images, video and other assets you generate reside, and retain as much control over them as possible.</p>
<p>The business model of major companies like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Flickr, Instagram and Youtube are all based upon you generating valuable content that people want to view, which then allows these companies to generate revenue by selling advertising or access to your (their) content. It is in their best interest to retain as much control over your content as they can. In 2014 there are many ways to assert control over your online world, and this project site is about me doing it for myself, but under a larger umbrella called Reclaim Your Domain.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can learn from me, an IT and API professional doing this for my own needs, but in a way that helps you understand what is possible for your own domain.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3Scale/3scale-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have been using <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API Infrastructure</a> to manage API Evangelis's public APIs for almost two years now. My APIs provide access to my blog posts, news I curate, and the tools I track on. I also use the same infrastructure to secure and manage various projects I work on. You can view a list of my APi deployments on my <a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/">API account management home page</a>.</p>
<p>In reality I haven't been all that serious about the management of my APIs until now. I have enough content I&rsquo;d like to make available via APIs, and I have a growing number of new APIs, some of which I'd like to make available for a fee, and see if I can&rsquo;t generate some new revenue streams off my research.</p>
<p>Until now I've been on the <a href="http://www.3scale.net/pricing/">3Scale base plan</a>, which is free and allows for 150,000 API transactions a day, and all the API management tools I needed to get going. This has been plenty for me to get my APIs established, but now I&rsquo;d like to be able to generate more API transactions, as well as be able to bill for API usage if I choose.</p>
<p>With this in mind I've finally upgraded beyond the basic 3Scale plan to the plus plan, which at $125.00 / month gives me up to 250,000 calls  a day, and the ability to charge for access to select APIs, opening up the possiblity to generate revenue on some of my content and programmatic resources.</p>
<p>The ability to sign up, deploy and management my APIs until I found my way, has been essential to me getting to this point. I would not have been able to play with different configurations of access to my APIs, without 3Scale. This ability to on-board into the world of APIs, experiment and iterate, before having to pay a monthly fee is essential to many companies figuring out what this whole API thing is about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty excited about taking some of my API ideas to the next level, and play with different ways to access my API driven resources, while being able to tell the story publicly, as I do with all of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/09/16-areas-of-my-core-api-research/">API research</a>.</p>
<p><em>Disclosure: 3Scale is an API Evangelist partner, but I pay for my own 3Scale account just like any other customer.</em></p>

        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-evangelist-screen-capture.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>Earlier this year <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/creating-my-own-screenshot-api/">I created a screen capture API</a>, filling a need I have across my network&mdash;capturing an image snapshot of any web page. Not all APIs are created the same, but I think this screen capture API represents a very fundamental layer of the API economy, the utility API. This API isn't Twitter or Google Maps, it does one thing and it does it well&mdash;something most APIs should work hard to achieve.</p>
<p>I've been using my screen capture API internally for several months now, and I think it is time to do more with it. I want to make this API available publicly, but I don&rsquo;t want to just make freely available to anyone on the open Internet, to use as much as they want. I want to create an access layer, using <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API infrastructure</a> management that allows me to control who has access, and what they can, or cannot do with it.</p>
<p>To help me plan the next steps for my screen capture API I'm working on:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Service Composition - An outline of the different ways I will sell access to my screen capture API</li>
<li>Operational Harness - An overview of how I will deliver these API services to my target customers</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal in all of this is to generate stories for API Evangelist, but I also want to push forward my own understanding of how API resources can be delivered, and what better way than providing my own APIs. I have a number of other APIs I would consider very utility in nature, that I want to launch, but I&rsquo;m going to focus on just the screen capture API for now, and try to establish a blueprint I can use across all of my APIs.</p>
<p>I will publish my screen capture API service composition and operational harness as separate blog posts. Then I will look at actually deploy the API in accordance with my service composition, and establish an operational platform in sync with my operational harness. I won't post every update here on API Evangelist about this work, you will have to visit my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API project</a> to find those updates.</p>

<p>As the API Evangelist I spend a lot of time cheering for companies to have APIs, and in 2014 I&rsquo;m continuing a slow shift from cheerleading to calling out companies who do not have an API. If you are an older company or institution I will be a lot more forgiving about whether or not an API exists, but with newer tech companies, there is NO excuse --an API is mandatory!</p>
<p>As a digital citizen in 2014, you should not use any online service that doesn&rsquo;t allow for data portability, which starts with the ability to just download a complete file of all your account settings and data, and is fully realized when a fully read/write API exists, with the support of a healthy, vibrant API community. If a company doesn&rsquo;t provide you with these basic data portability features, you are most likely in a hostage situation where you are generating content and value for a company, with no say in how your content is used, monetized or even removed.</p>
<p>I am reminded of an example of a modern tech company, who is harvesting the knowledge and wisdom of the crowd, but offers nothing back in return to its users, by Andy Baio (@waxpancake):</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 15px;" lang="en">
<p>Worth noting: Quora has no public API, no backup/export tools, blocks anonymous display of answers, and banned the Wayback Machine entirely.</p>
&mdash; Andy Baio (@waxpancake) <a href="https://twitter.com/waxpancake/statuses/453958676529696769">April 9, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>After I retweeted Andy&rsquo;s reminder, one of my followers said they would like to retweet, but they want to make sure it was true. Andy said to go look for their self, and that after over 300+ retweets nobody had challenged his statement--which the reply was he didn't have time. Well I have time to go look, and verify whether or not Quora has an API&mdash;let&rsquo;s take a look, and what better way than to just ask Quora!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.quora.com/Does-a-Quora-API-exihttp://www.quora.com/Does-a-Quora-API-exist">Does a Quora API exist?</a> The short answer is yes. There is the <a href="http://www.quora.com/Edmond-Lau/Edmond-Laus-Posts/Quora-Extension-API">Quora Extension API</a>, which is a &ldquo;json-based data API exposing information about the currently logged-in user&rdquo;. This API is purely designed for use in a toolbar, not building apps or even extracting a users data, and the developer Edmond Lau (<a href="https://twitter.com/edmondlau">@edmondlau</a>), who posted the announcement of the API is gone from Quora, which is usually a sign that an API project has lost its leader.</p>
<p>There are plenty of questions about <a href="http://www.quora.com/Quora-API/When-is-Quora-planning-an-open-API">when is Quora planning an open API?</a>, and there are responses from Quora founders, like this one from Charlie Cheever - 9 Jun, 2010:</p>
<blockquote><em>When there are enough users and content on Quora that an API would be really useful, we'll almost certainly add one. For right now, we'll probably focus on the web interface since that's how we think most people will use the product, at least to start.  Another reason we probably won't do an API for a little while is that the interface into the product is changing frequently in big ways right now (ex. We added "thanks" a few days ago and we're not sure if we'll keep that or not,) and APIs that aren't stable are hard to use effectively.</em></blockquote>
<p>After reading the answers it is evident to me that there is no API knowledge or passionate leader at Quora. Charlie&rsquo;s response demonstrates they don&rsquo;t possess a true understanding of what is possible with a properly executed API, the agiity it will bring to their own dev cycles, but also the community opportunities that will emerge. Without a fundamental knowledge of APIs, company leaders always possess a lack of understanding how you can manage and control content in even more powerful ways than you can, with just an web interface.</p>
<p>Of course there is speculation on <a href="http://www.quora.com/Quora-API/Why-isnt-there-a-public-Quora-API">why isn't there a public Quora API?</a>. With a pretty direct response from Chuck Russell, Sr. Partner Collective Intelligence Inc.:</p>
<blockquote><em>Maybe Quora wants to own the corpus of thought on the platform. Coupled with your Twitter, FB and Linkedin social profiles they know quite a bit about you. To assume that they're not monetizing this information is naive. At this point they don't want to dilute the value of the psychometrics they've collected by creating aggregator-like competitors. The fact that they say they're "working on it" is absolute BS. Either the Quora team is incompetent or they are disingenuous. Which is more likely?</em></blockquote>
<p>Beyond the discussion about the Quora API, the conversation quickly moves into <a href="http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-way-to-backup-your-Quora-answers-and-votes">what's the best way to backup your Quora answers and votes</a>, and <a href="http://www.quora.com/Would-writing-a-Quora-scraper-in-the-absence-of-an-API-get-me-banned-for-life-from-Quora--hich">would writing a Quora-scraper (in the absence of an API) get me banned for life from Quora</a>? &nbsp;I find it very interesting, and telling that Quora hasn&rsquo;t chimed in on these threads. There is a sensible answer recommending that scrapers should adhere to the sites robots.txt, which begins with a request to email them when you are crawling the site. Is this the poor mans on-boarding process for content partners?</p>
<p>In my experience, the lack of an API and data portability is the result of two things: 1) lack of understanding of business and politics of APIs 2) lack of a healthy, creative monetization strategy. I think the responses I&rsquo;ve seen cover number one, but <a href="http://www.quora.com/Quoras-Business-Model-and-Monetization/What-could-Quoras-long-term-business-plan-be">what could Quora's long-term business plan be?</a> According to Yair Livne, Data Science Manager at Quora, which has a vote by Adam D'Angelo (Quora Founder &amp; CEO):</p>
<blockquote><em>Advertising models represent an interesting opportunity for Quora, given the nature of our traffic.Quora's traffic is 30-40% direct intent: people searching for something, asking a question, or indicating in some other way that they are looking for something specific. And given our high percentage of commercial intent traffic, I would estimate that our long-term implied CPMs for advertising would be comparable to those achieved by web search (Google, Yahoo, Bing) and vertical search (LinkedIn, TripAdvisor, Yelp). With these products, people are explicit about the question they are trying to answer and the topics they are interested in learning about. This creates exciting ad opportunities because you can deliver real results for both people and advertisers.</em></blockquote>
<p>This smells like a play out of the Twitter playbook to me, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/25/lack-of-pinterest-api-is-a-lack-of-api-business-strategy/">where much like Pinterest</a>, Quora is not going make the same mistakes as Twitter by having an API and relinquishing any control over its content, in ways that might hurt monetization for their investors or just confuse operations for them. This represents a lack of understanding of the business and politics of APIs, and an inability to truly innovate when it comes to monetization.</p>
<p>Quora refelects a pretty basic Silicon Valley formula for making money. Create site that attracts users, and generates content or media, and as long as you can control all eyeballs who view this content, at some point you can monetize by placing ads along with that content. In the beginning you have to act like you care about your users, so they will sign up, return and generate content. As part of this process you pretend like an API is coming, but in reality you just want to retain as much control over the content your community has generated as you can.</p>
<p>This classic formula for extracting and controlling the value online users create, is an easy and proven formula for generating value that investors can get behind. Giving users access to their data, and providing an ecosystem for other businesses to come in an innovate takes way to much thinking, creativity and belief that your core business model is truly unique and valuable. The Quoras, Pinterests, and Twitters of the world don&rsquo;t have time to explore the future of user generated content ownership, or new and interesting ways of monetization beyond the classic advertising. It is somewhat unfair that Twitter is listed above, because they do have data portability and an API, but I include them in the group because I strongly feel they have left serious money on the table by not letting the ecosystem help them in their monetization efforts, and just focusing on Twitter advertising. I know its what your investors get, but it is sooooo shortsided.</p>
<p>The reason I write this post is that I want the average Internet user to understand the inner workings of the tech companies they are lining up to use. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You should not use any platform that doesn&rsquo;t provide data portability and an </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AP</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span></strong>. If a company doesn&rsquo;t provide this in 2014, there is either incompetency at the helm, or there are other motivations involved&mdash;usually the fact that you are the product, generating value for the platform and sharing that wealth with you is not in the business plan. Shouldn&rsquo;t you go somewhere else with your contribution, somewhere that values what you bring to the table, and gives you a vote and ast least ownership over your work?</p>
<p>I have a <a href="http://www.quora.com/Kin-Lane">Quora profile</a>, but if you follow me, you notice I don&rsquo;t answer many questions or participate in any meaningful way&mdash;this is because I do not have any control over my knowledge that hand over to Quora. I will up vote, or maybe provide a short answer now and then, but if I want to share some wisdom I will do it on a platform that I have some control over like my blog, or even Twitter. Why would I hand over my content for Quora to own, monetize without any sort of nod to the value I bring to the table?</p>

<p>I am playing with different ways of explaining the 100K view of how companies, and ultimately governments will participate in the API economy. As with APIs themselves, visualizing something like how an API platform can position itself in the emerging API economy, is very difficult to do&mdash;something that takes refinement, something I do by blogging, so here we go...</p>
<p>Much like developers are looking into the details of each API call, using API integration tools like <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">RunScope</a> and <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a>, to better understand how their applications are consuming APIs, API providers need to understand all the moving parts involved with successfully executing an API strategy.  To help me articulate to API providers, I try to break things down into small digestible modules that will help me demonstrate &nbsp;how they all work in concert to orchestrate the delivery of digital resources inside and outside the firewall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of these modules represent the levers, dials and switches you will use to define your participation in the API economy.

API consumers will never use an API if they can't on-board efficiently, the price is too high or licensing to strict, while they will flourish in a more balanced, carefully planned configuration.</p>
<p>APIs aren't just about making data, content and digital resources available publicly. APIs are about optimizing access and consumption of these resources, encouraging access in ways that benefit owners and stakeholders. While there is no perfect configuration that will ensure success in all business sectors, there are some blueprints we can follow that set the right tone, and the levers, dials and switches listed above can be adjusted and tuned in real-time for optimal performance.</p>

<p>I just published a post <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/10/developer-portals-on-github-example-from-socrata/">showcasing Socrata's use of Github to deploy their new open data and API developer portal.</a> There are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/08/api-management-using-github/">numerous reasons for using Github as part of your API management strategy</a>, with one of the main reasons being the collaborative features that Git, and the social coding platform Github introduce.</p>
<p>I've had the news about Socrata&rsquo;s new developer portal open for over a day now, and what triggered that story was seeing a link to the <a href="http://api.data.gov/docs/regulations/#!/regulations.json/">regulations API on data.gov</a>, which not only just uses Swagger for the API definition, it employs a simple portal that is deployed using Github pages.</p>
<p>Deploying API developer areas on Github, using Github pages is nothing new, we've been doing it a while now. However there is a groundswell within federal government recently, so I think its worth noting&mdash;hoping other open data and API folks in government jump in too!</p>
<p>I like the basic layout of the regulations API portal. It is a simple overview, changelog, terms of service and interactive API documentation using Swagger. Then demonstrating one of the biggest benefits of deploying your developer portal on Github, it simply says: <strong><em>&ldquo;Help Improve This Content&rdquo;</em></strong>, directing users to edit, fork and submit a pull requests on the portal&rsquo;s Github repository&mdash;enabling anyone to improve the portal content, with the approval of the API administrator of course.</p>

<p>The end of last year I was asked to spent time thinking about three things: 1) <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/">An API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA</a>)  2) Next steps for the Green Button API 3) <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/what-is-next-for-the-us-government-api-strategy/">API strategy for the overall United States Government</a>. I managed to find the bandwidth to get two of the three projects active, but neglected to spend time on the Green Button API.</p>
<p>To support my research I established a <a href="http://doe-data.github.io/green-button-api/">Green Button API repository on Github</a>, where  will track all my work. My goal is to pull together all the existing pieces of the Green Button API into one place, and evolve a strategy for taking Green Button API the next step. Like I did with the FAFSA API, I just want to explore what is possible, and jump start a conversation either within government and outside with other 3rd parties.</p>
<p>I've spent a few hours gathering what elements I could find about Green Button&mdash;existing sites, APIs, code, documentation, etc. Over the next couple of weeks I will spend more time connecting the dots, and tell the story via my Green Button API project blog.</p>
<p>If you have any resources I should consider, or would like to provide any feedback, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/doe-data/green-button-api/issues">Github issue management for the Green Button API repository</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.socrata.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/socrata/socrata-data-experience-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Civic data platform <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a> has launched a <a href="http://dev.socrata.com/">new developer area</a> to support developers who are building apps on top of city, county, state and federal data, as well as the publishers of this data. A release of a new developer area is always worthy of note in my tracking of the API space&mdash;anytime I see a tweet or blog post about the release of new developer area, I will visit to see what is going on.</p>
<p>The first thing I find particularly interesting about Socrata&rsquo;s approach is that they published as a Github repository, using Github Pages. We are seeing more government developer areas move onto Github, because of the easy site hosting with Github Pages, and the benefits of managing your projects with Git, as well as social benefits of Github and its underlying API.</p>
<p><strong>Application Developers</strong><br /> Socrata provides a wealth of information for application developers, including a getting started guide, robust API documentation, client libraries, and D3.js assistance for those looking to build visualizations on top of government data.</p>
<p><strong>Data Publishers</strong><br /> On the other side of the coin, Socrata also provides data publishers with what they need to get started, clean and organize their data, and the ability publish or sync with the Socrata platform, providing R, Ruby and Java libraries that really jumpstart integration.</p>
<p>The second thing I really like about the new Socrata portal is that it is more educational than it is technical, and tailored to onboard the next generation of government data publishers and consumers. Socrata doesn&rsquo;t just provide details about API endpoints, they provide information on what is JSON and HTTP verbs. From years of experience, Socrata has a firm grasp of the amount of education the space needs to get up to speed, and it shows in their developer portal.</p>
<p><a href="http://dev.socrata.com/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/socrata/socrata-developers.png" alt="" width="450" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>To provide some critique of the implementation, the formatting of the text wasn&rsquo;t the easiest to consume. For some reason the font-size, density and layout made it hard to spend too scan and spend time with. I&rsquo;d recommend taking a look at <a href="http://www.fullcontact.com/developer/docs/">FullContact API</a> in separate browser tab, then flip back and forth, to demonstrate what I mean. Next I think Socrata could go further with contrasting things between developers and non-developers&mdash;the potential is there to really onboard people who don&rsquo;t write code, an <a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/">example of this in action is over at Dwolla</a>.</p>
<p>As part of my API monitoring, I think I will have to add some sort of tag for APIs that deploy their developer area via Github, so I can keep track of interesting implementations. When your developer area is published on Github, I just think it invites collaboration, and participation from the community.</p>

<p>The mission of API Evangelist is all about bringing awareness of APIs to the masses. The biggest challenge I face in doing this, is that API Evangelist is primarily a blog, which means a chronological listing of content I produce.  When you are new to the API space, you can start with home page, but then you have to start sprinting to keep up with what I'm dish'n up on the blog. I have been working to address this by deploying other static research sites like <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com">evangelism</a>, <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">monetization</a> for API providers, and <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a> and <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a> on the API consumption side&mdash;however, even with this work its not enough.</p>
<p>This is why its great to see other resources emerge that help new API providers and consumers get up to speed on the space, while still remaining informative for the advanced users, or anywhere on the API proficiency spectrum. In this case I&rsquo;m talking about <a href="http://apicodex.3scale.net/">API Codex</a> , the curated site for API news from <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a>--if you want to find the best articles from the API space, addressing all levels of expertise, API Codex is the resource you are looking for.</p>
<p>The first thing you see when you land on API Codex:</p>
<blockquote><em>Just getting started? Check out our <a href="http://apicodex.3scale.net/content/API101">API101 page</a>!</em></blockquote>
<p>Then you can browse the best articles from the space, by level of expertise, and by tag, as well as find the best API stories organized by author. This isn&rsquo;t just a random stream of articles from the API space, it is the best of the best from the API space. There is also an API tools section along with the API news, showcasing the best in tooling for both API providers and consumers.</p>
<p>As the API universe expands we are going to have to get better at organizing the most valuable educational API resource, and making them accessible to users. It makes me happy to see API Codex emerge, augmenting what ProgrammableWeb has been doing for the last 9 years, and API Evangelist has been doing for the last 4 year, delivering the valuable curation of essential API industry content.</p>

<p>Scraping has been something I&rsquo;ve done since I first started working on the web. Sometimes you just need some data or a piece of content that isn't available in a machine readable format, and the only way is to get it scrape it off a web page.</p>
<p>Scraping is widespread, but something very few individuals or companies will admit to doing. Just like writing scripts for pulling data from APIs, I write a lot of scripts that pull content and data from websites and RSS feeds. Even though I tend to write my own scripts for scraping, I&rsquo;ve been closely watching the new breed of scraping tools like Scraperwiki:</p>

<p>I was first attracted to Scraperwiki as a way to harvest Tweets, and further interested by their web and PDF extraction tools.  Scraperwiki has already been around for a while, founded back in 2010, and recently there is a new wave of scraping tools that have emerged:</p>

<p>Importio turns the web into a database, releasing the vast potential of data trapped in websites. Allowing you to identify a website, select the data and treat it as a table in your database. In effect transform the data into a row and column format. You can then add more websites to your data set, the same as adding more rows and query in real-time to access the data.</p>

<p>Kimono and Import.io provide scraping tools for anyone, even non-developers to scrape content from web pages, but also allow you to deploy an API from the content. While it is easy to deploy APIs using data and content from the other scraping providers I track on, the new breed of scraping services focus on API deployment as end-goal.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam</a>, the final panel of the event was called &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhbm_MtSYlg">toward 1 million APIs</a>&rdquo;, and scraping came up as one possible way that we will get to APIs at this scale. Sometimes the stewards or owners of data just don&rsquo;t have the resources to deploy APIs, and the only way to deploy an API will be to scrape data and content and publish as web API--either internally or externally by 3rd party.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="http://scraping.apievangelist.com/">research site setup to keep track of scraping news I come across, as well as any companies and tools I discover</a>. Beyond ScraperWiki, Kimono and Import.io I&rsquo;m watching these additional scraping services.</p>

        <p>When I first started API Evangelist, I wanted to better understand the business of APIs, which really focused on API management. Over the course of four years, the list of companies delivering API management services has expanded with new entrants, an evolved with acquisitions of some of the major players.

<p>In 2011, people would always ask me, which API management company will help you with deployment? For a while, the answer was none of them, but this soon changed with new players emerging, and expanding of services from existing providers. To help me understand the expanding API lifecycle I started two new separate research areas:</p>

<p>Once you design, deploy your API, and you get a management plan in place, you have to start looking at how you are going to make money and get the word out. In an effort to better understand the business of APIs, I setup research sites for researching the monetizationand evangelizing of APIs:</p>

<p>As the API space has matured, I started seeing that I would have to pay better attention to not just providing APIs, but also better track on the consumption of APIs. With this in mind I start looking into how APIs are discovered and what service and tools developers are using when integrating with APIs:</p>

<p>In 2013, I saw also saw a conversation grow around an approach to designing APIs, called hypermedia. Last year things moved beyond just academic discussion around designing hypermedia APIs, to actual rubber meeting the road with companies deploying well designed hypermedia APIs. In January I decided that it was time to regularly track on what is going on in the hypermedia conversation:.</p>

<p>After that there are three areas that come up regularly in monitoring of the space, and pieces of the API puzzle that I don&rsquo;t just think are important to API providers and consumers, they are areas I actively engage in:</p>

<p>There are other research projects I have going on, but these area reflect the core of my API monitoring and research. They each live as separate Github repositories, accessible through Github pages. I publish news, companies, tools, and my analysis on a regular basis. I use them for my own education, and I hope you can find useful as well.</p>

<p>I stumbled into a pretty interesting use of Github yesterday, which I&rsquo;m seeing as part of a greater push from our government to use the popoular social coding platform. The government blog <a href="http://govfresh.com/">Govfresh</a> held a live chat session with FCC CIO David Bray (<a href="https://twitter.com/fcc_cio">@fcc_cio</a>), where some really interesting questions were asked of the very progressive CIO.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to break up a few of the questions into separate blog posts, what I wanted to highlight in this post was the use of Github as a chat forum, showing once again that the platform isn&rsquo;t just about managing code, but can be used to openly manage a multitude of collaborative government technical operations.</p>
<p>Luke Fretwell (<a href="https://twitter.com/lukefretwell">@lukefretwell</a>) opened up the discussion which ran for about an hour, asking Bray several questions, and then Steve Spiker (<a href="https://twitter.com/spjika">@spjika</a>), myself and the infamous Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile)</a> chimed in with further questions&mdash;making for a pretty interesting discussion.</p>
<p>Govfresh used <a href="https://github.com/gitrun/chat">Gitchat</a>, a way of turning Github Issue Management + Github APIs into a chat thread, for the conversation. I like this approach to managing and controlling a live conversation, with the ability to archive for future use. I think it is also a great way to help people in government understand that Github is more than just code, it is also about being very social and collaborative around technical ideas.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/18f/18F_logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There has been some <a href="http://e-pluribusunum.com/2014/03/12/at-18f-in-gsa-u-s-seeks-to-tap-the-success-of-the-u-k-s-government-digital-services/">great coverage of the new group of tech specialists out of the GSA</a>, dubbed <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>. According to their own home page, 18F:</p>
<blockquote><em>...builds effective, user-centric digital services focused on the interaction between government and the people and businesses it serves. We help agencies deliver on their mission through the development of digital and web services.</em></blockquote>
<p>I know most of the team members from my work with the GSA, and my own time (albeit short) as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, and I am extremely optimistic about the potential of the team. This optimism is being seriously validated after looking through the groups recent release of the <a href="http://docs.fbopen.apiary.io/">FBOpen API</a>, which is a simple API resource to get access to opportunities to do business with the U.S. Federal Government.</p>
<p><strong>Use Existing Tools</strong><br /> The 18F demonstrates their tech chops by not re-inventing the wheel when it comes to designing and developing the FBOpen API. After they downloaded the existing business opportunity XML dumps from <a href="http://fbo.gov">FBO.gov</a>, they employed <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a> to develop a thin API layer on top of the files. Solr does two things well, it provides a REST interface on top of document stores, and supports the Lucene query syntax, which provides a powerful query interface on top of the simple API. Beyond Solr, 18F also used <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary</a> and <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>, to cobble together a platform for API operations, demonstrating their dedication to agility and speed.</p>
<p><strong>Simplicity Rules</strong><br /> The FBOpen API interface adheres to API simplicity by providing logical, versioned URI for accessing the government business opportunities, with a query and data source parameter allowing you to tailor the source of your query. Then you can filter by noncompetes or closed opportunities, as well as controlling the number of results returned, including common pagination controls developers are used to when working with APIs. FBOpen API does one thing, and does it well--the calling card of successful APis.</p>
<p><a href="https://fbopen.gsa.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fbopen/fbopen-pilot-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Modern Design Lifecycle</strong><br /> Again, demonstrating their grasp of modern technology, 18F employs Apiary to model and design the FBOpen API interface--using <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> allowed them to define the API interface in markdown, then deploy a mock interface, interactive API documentation and code samples in a variety of languages. This approach to designing APIs in government is the future for not just providing a machine readable definition of the API, but delivers the documentation and code necessary to onboard any developer in minutes&mdash;increasing the chances the API will be integrated with.</p>
<p><strong>Open By Default</strong><br /> The FBOpen API sets the bar for all government APIs, by making sure not just the API is public and accessible, but so is the API design, source code and underlying tooling&mdash;allowing anyone to deploy an instance of the FBOpen API. Since FBOpoen is built on Solr, publicly available XML data source, and published on Github, anyone can download or fork, and deploy their own instance of the FBOpen API. This is the definition of an open API.</p>
<p><strong>Central Key Management With api.data.gov</strong><br /> Before you can make calls on the central FBOpen API instance, you must obtain an API key from <a href="https://api.data.gov/">api.data.gov</a>. This should be standard business operations for ALL federal government APIs. Developers shouldn't have to manage separate accounts with each agency, they should be able to request credentials in a single location, and use across all APIs they consume within in the federal government. api.data.gov uses <a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella">API Umbrella</a>, an open source API management solution developed by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and is employed by the GSA in the common API infrastructure available to all agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Read / Write APIs in Government (kindasorta)</strong><br /> I started to cry when I saw that there was not just a GET method for FBOpen, but here was a POST method, allowing for users to add or update opportunities via the API&mdash;then I saw it was disabled, and the tears dried up. The option is only available if you deploy your own instance of the API, which in my opinion actually represents the future of read / write APIs in government. I just don't think government can move fast enough, and manage the responsibility of write APIs in all scenarios, and providing open source APIs like FBOpen, that anyone can download, install and allow for adding and updating data can bridge this canyon. If enough trusted instances of the FBOpen can be established outside the federal government firewall, agencies can make their own decision around which sources they want to trust and pull opportunities back into internal systems. With proper certification of API deployments by our government, APIs lie FBOpen can share the load of managing data with private sector, without the risk that comes with doing it all internally.</p>
<p><a href="http://gsa.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/gsa/gsa-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Examples Of What Is Possible With FBOpen API</strong><br /> Along with all the essential technical building blocks, 18F provides three examples of what you can build with the FBOpen API, stimulating the imagination of would be developers. While developers are very innovative when it comes to APIs, they often need stimulation when it comes to understanding what is possible within specific domains&mdash;the FBOpen examples achieve this, planting seeds of what developers can do, increasing the chance that meaningful integrations with the API will occur.</p>
<p><strong>Using Their Own API</strong><br /> The ulitmate example of what is possible with the FBOpen API, is the fact that they use it for driving the <a href="https://fbopen.gsa.gov/">FBOpen website</a>. Nothing shows developers the value that an API delivers, and that it is a resource that they can depend on, than seeing an API provider use their own API. When government agencies use their own APIs it sends the right signal to developers, while also helping agencies see what developers face when putting government API resources to use.</p>
<p><strong>Telling The Story Behind FBOpen</strong><br /> Via the <a href="https://github.com/18f/fbopen">FBOpen Github repository</a>, 18F tells the story behind the API. Walking us through where the idea came from, what technology went into its development, and demonstrates how to get started, examples of how it can be used, where there are limitations, and what is on the roadmap. This type of storytelling behind an API, especially APIs that are open at every level (which should be default for all government), helps developer put these valuable, open government resources to work&mdash;without the story, the API will still be a black box, no matter how open the source code is.</p>
<p><strong>Humble And Honest</strong><br /> As part of the FBOpen documentation and story, 18F is open and honest about their work, stating <em>"This project is brand new and very incomplete. No guarantees of data completeness or functionality are implied or should be assumed. There is lots to do!&rdquo;.</em> This is soooooooo important! APIs will never be perfect, and government agencies should never wait until things are perfect to release in the public sphere--APIs are about iteration and learning, and setting expectations with developers will help them iterate and learn, but also will assist agency owners in iterating and learning as well.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Licensing</strong><br /> The policy restrictions and licensing around government open data and APIs can be confusing. Not all government resources are openly licensed by default, despite what you might think. 18F clearly lays out the license for FBOpen, <em>"This project constitutes an original work of the United States Government. This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain. see the LICENSE file for more.&rdquo;</em> This is critical to setting the tone for how developers will integrate with an API, and publishing this front and center is the right way to get it out of the way, eliminating friction with new developers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying hard to find some critical feedback for the 18F team, and I really can&rsquo;t. Sure there are more building blocks I could suggest, but the essential ones are there. FBOpen provides clear value (access to government business opportunities), simple interface, documentation, code samples, on-boarding, and licensing. I guess the only thing I'd recommend is clearer contact and support info&mdash;do I go to api.data.gov, 18F or publish issues via the Github repository? Maybe providing a simple block that lays this out for developers on the Github README page.</p>
<p>FBOpen is a model for all government APIs, and shows that 18F the real deal. This approach to deploying API resources in government, one that allow you to use as is in the cloud, or deploy your own instance, IS THE FUTURE OF GOVERNMENT RESOURCES! As I stated above the opportunities for establishing federated networks around government resources, that give birth to new public and private sector partnerships, similar to what is available within the IRS modernized e-file system, is the future of government and the API economy&mdash;one where we all share the load.</p>
<p>Nice work 18F, if you can continue this type of work across agencies, you will be the change we've all been talking about in government.</p>

<p>I was just having another conversation about virtualized cloud containers like <a href="http://docker.io">Docker.io</a>, and the approaches from leading cloud providers like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">Amazon with Cloud Formations</a>, and <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">RedHat with OpenShift</a>. This is a subject that seems to be coming up more and more, and is definitely something you&rsquo;ll see more of on API Evangelist, as well as being discussed at future <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> and <a href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a>.</p>
<p>John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>)&nbsp;of <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a> put it best, a couple weeks back during a similar conversation:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 25px;" lang="en">
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> containers will do for APIs what APIs do for companies.</p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Virtual containers will make API driven resources even more agile, nimble and scalable--not just for providers, but also for consumers. Everything we have right now I&rsquo;d consider to be a retail API market&mdash;where even though APIs are sold b2b, they are generally a one-size fits all API solution. Think about when API resources become modular, customizable, scalable, wholesale resources that can be bought and sold, and deployed anywhere, making all digital assets into commodities that are ready for use in the API economy.</p>
<p>In preparation for some research on the subject, I pulled together my stories on this subject from the last couple months:</p>

<p>Ole provides a nice overview of the three leading API definition formats, giving API providers a good side-by-side summary that can be used when deciding which format to support. I will work with Ole to help keep the numbers up to date, and include in my final research white paper for API design when finished.</p>
<p>Thank you too Ole Lensmar (<a href="https://twitter.com/olensmar">@olensmar</a>) and <a href="http://smartbear.com/">Smartbear Software</a> for doing this research, and allowing me to share it with you.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.evercam.io/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/evercam/evercam-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.evercam.io/">Internet of things (Iot), and security camera API platform evercam.io</a> has submitted the API definition for their camera API to the <a href="http://apicommons.org/apis.html">API Commons</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been impressed with the amount of leadership that is coming out of this new startup in a potentially very political, and inevitable aspect of the API economy&mdash;cameras.</p>
<p>Marco Herbst (<a href="https://twitter.com/marcoherbst">@marcoherbst</a>) of evercam.io approached me during <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">#APIStrat in Amsterdam</a> and expressed interest in submitting their <a href="https://api.evercam.io/v1/swagger.json">Swagger API definition</a> into the commons, and this last weekend we created the API Commons manifest and published to the commons.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1e27KIc" target="_blank"><img style="border: 0px solid #000;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When I spoke with Marco several months ago about API Commons, he took the importance of submitting an API definition to heart. By doing so evercam.io is saying that their API definition is significant in their industry, and something that others in the industry should follow.</p>
<p>This type of stance in an industry like Iot is going to become crucial in encouraging not just manufacturers to adhere to a common format, but also saving application developers and data scientists time when their are building Iot solutions.</p>
<p>Thanks evercam.io for sharing your API definition with the world, and taking your role and responsibility in defining an interface to a very important layer of the API economy, so seriously.</p>

<p>As I have evolved my blog from a content management system into an API industry monitoring system, much like other companies I work with, I&rsquo;m making the switch to use more APIs in my operations. As I roll out these APIs, I want to share them with you, here within the API Evangelist developer area.</p>
<p>Here at developer.apievangelist.com you will find APIs that give you access to the content I curate and turn into stories, the analysis I provide on the API space, and companies, tools and other resources that I use make API Evangelist go around.</p>
<p>Sometimes I will roll out APIs as separate projects, and other times I will roll them out here, the central API area for API Evangelist.  I&rsquo;m working to separate out some of my resources, much like other companies do in the space, and allow my internal systems to read / write, while also providing public and partner access to these resources. I am even working to create premium, pay for use API resources, but most of the time you will find my APIs are free.</p>
<p>If there is anything you&rsquo;d like to see me publish, let me know. You can use the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/developer-api-evangelist/issues">issue management for the Github repository</a> that houses this project to share any comments, thoughts or issues. Thanks for tuning in!</p>

<p>Last week at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">#APIStrat in Amsterdam</a>, I had the pleasure of watching a keynote by Romain Huet (<a href="https://twitter.com/romainhuet">@romainhuet</a>), Developer Advocate at Twitter, aptly titled &ldquo;connecting to the pulse of the planet&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of watching Romain give this talk twice now, and he really delivers&mdash;you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkKEZMjFLSQ" target="_blank">watch the whole video on Youtube</a>.</p>
<p>Romain used Twitter as a conduit for not just one, but two live Internet of things (Iot) demos. First he took a live selfie of him and the audience with a Raspberry Pi camera he had developed, and second he made a drone take off on stage using commands he sent via Twitter.</p>
<p>When talking to Romain earlier in Amsterdam, we were discussing APIs and Iot, and I said that Twitter seems to be a wonderful gateway for developers, when it came to connecting devices to the Internet. As an API driven messaging channel, developers just get Twitter and its APIs, so it makes sense we&rsquo;d use this familiar channel for exploration communication in the Internet of things.</p>
<p>Twitter works well as a gateway API to Iot for developers because of its familiarity and ease of use, but it also immediately makes it social, allowing us to open up Iot communications to a trusted network, or even the public. While we don&rsquo;t want every device in our lives immediately social, it works well for us to learn new thing, allowing us to learn using tools we are already familiar with, and have a network of established friends.</p>
<p>Like it or not, I think many Iot devices will come pre-configured to work with our common social networks, and as the Iot world matures, we will find more logical ways to communicate with these devices in our lives&mdash;realizing that not everything needs to social and on the web, but in the early days we&rsquo;ll depend on these characteristics to understand how to make devices and sensors communicate.</p>

<p>As I go through the management of my 60+ research sites that make up my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>, I can't help but think about how I can automate specific aspects of the process. This is the way my custom built platform works, I have workflows and tasks I accomplish each day, and as I have time, I will write scripts and automate where I can.</p>
<p>In an ordinary week I will process hundreds of blog feeds, tweets and new APIs, and sometimes I&rsquo;m tempted to automated my curation, sorting, tagging and other aspects of what I do, but then I find valuable nuggets on company sites, blog and other places. Valuable insight that my algorithms wouldn't necessarily find, things that I can use in stories across the API Evangelist network, as well as expand my own knowledge.</p>
<p>Each day I work to strike this balance between manually monitoring the API space, and automating what I do. I am constantly re-evaluating whether something is better automated, and at what point does something need my critical eye.</p>
<p>As I write this post, I can't help but think about all the talk of automation via the web, mobile apps and Internet of things (Iot) each day, and hope that we all can find restraint, and apply critical thinking around how we best use Internet enabled technology in our lives&mdash;minimizing what we lose by automating our worlds.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Apr 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-handshake.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a wave of blog posts about additions to the developer and partner programs, of some of the leading APIs in the industry, making me think its time for some more research into the area. Partner programs come in several shapes and sizes, and go by different names, and are something I would like to understand better. I have several Evernote folders full of research on API partner programs, now I just need to polish it and publish it here on the blog, and possibly give it its own research repository on Github.</p>
<p>Many companies consider their API partner programs, a type of partner all by itself. However when I talk about partner or developer programs, it is about establishing multiple tiers of API access, within an API developer ecosystem.  When most think of APIs, a vision of an open, public API comes to mind&mdash;when in reality, many APIs will have multiple levels of access, with public just being the first rung of the partner ladder.</p>
<p>Some APIs start with signing up to be a partner, and require developers share details of their integration idea, before they can gain access to an API. <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/form_ecosystem.html?cmp=usbrb&amp;cm=s&amp;csr=watson.site_20140319&amp;cr=deveco&amp;ct=usbrb301&amp;cn=sec3partnerapp">IBM does this with their Watson platform</a>, requiring developers to share their idea, and wait for approval before they can access resources.  I always recommend providing a open access version of API resources, something that is self-service, and can be accessed 24/7 by developers, but this won&rsquo;t be applicable with all APIs.</p>
<p>To find solid examples of API partner programs, I wanted to start with the API pioneers, as they have been doing this a while, and have a great deal of experience managing very large, mature developer ecosystems.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/salesforce/salesforce-logo.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Salesforce</strong><br /> This early pioneer in the API space crafted their <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/partners/overview/">AppExchange Partner Program</a> to have two separate models that developers can take advantage of: ISVforce allowing developers to build, market, and sell apps only to salesforce.com customers at 15% cut, and Force.com Embedded which allows developers to build, market, and sell apps to any customer, with a 25% cut for Saleforce. They know how to do it right, with a dedicated partner community, complete with events and news for software vendors and consultants to tap after joining, then being approved for the Saleforce AppExchange Partner Program.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Amazon Web Services</strong><br /> To meet the demand for quality technical talent, Amazon provides the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/certification/">AWS Certification Program</a>. Amazon provides training and certification of three types of partners: solutions architect, developer and sysops administrator&mdash;allowing for an associate, professional and master levels of each certification. Amazon&rsquo;s focus is on identifying the best quality developer talent to support the demand within its cloud ecosystem, and less about providing access to API resources, which it's business model manages just fine.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/ebay/ebay.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>eBay</strong><br /> The king of online auctions, eBay is up next with their <a href="https://www.ebaypartnernetwork.com">partner network</a>, which is all about developers, registering and getting a revenue share in the commerce they bring to the network. The bar is pretty low for being an eBay partner, which requires your web site to be functioning, have a phone number and bank account.  Of course you have to agree to their <a href="https://publisher.ebaypartnernetwork.com/PublisherRegPSA">network agreement</a>, adhere to their code of conduct, and respect their <a href="https://publisher.ebaypartnernetwork.com/PublisherRegPP">privacy policy</a>. While eBay is looking to qualify their developers, they are motivated by growing their network, and generating more revenue.</p>
<p>After looking at the early API pioneers, the next place to look is amongst the leading social networks, who also have experience in managing very large developer ecosystems, yet establishing their own approaches to successful API partner programs.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/facebook/facebook-logo.jpg" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Facebook</strong><br /> First up in the social realm is <a href="http://www.facebook-pmdcenter.com/">Facebook with their preferred marking developers (PMD)</a>, which allows developers to apply for three types of PMD: Strategic, Facebook Exchange (FBX), and Mobile Measurement.  Facebook provides PMD with a badge to demonstrate their certification, and program updates, case studies, white papers and other resource they will need to be successful. Facebook PMDs are showcased in a directory, allowing any business to search and find the resources they need to build apps, tools and features on top of Facebook APIs.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/linkedin/linkedin-logo.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>LinkedIn</strong><br /> After Facebook, the business social network LinkedIn has invested heavily in their <a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/certified-developer-program">certified developer program (CDP)</a> lately. CDPs are certified by LinkedIn as the best developers available on the LinkedIn platform. As part of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1J8EnvfY9HeuuYPlW53y2FZ3PlO-ltsrn9szkwXUnaD0/viewform">CDP application process</a>, developers have to adhere to the linked in <a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/linkedin-platform-guidelines">platform policies and guidelines</a>, and await LinkedIn approval that a company meets their approval. CDP is one of <a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/partner">10 separate partner programs</a> that LinkedIn has.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/twitter/tweet-bird-blue-white.png" alt="" width="90" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Twitter</strong><br /> Next up, Twitter is looking to establish the best products and services, that help business thrive on Twitter, using their <a href="https://business.twitter.com/partners">Twitter Partner Marketplace</a>. Twitter if focused on developing product partners with superior apps built on Twitter API, and marketing partners who can deliver the vital services Twitter users need.  To<a href="https://business.twitter.com/partners/twitter-certified-program-application"> apply to become a partner</a>, you must swear to be a good partner to Twitter, follow the guidelines, rules, and the &ldquo;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms">developer rules of the road</a>&rdquo;, which is Twitter&rsquo;s API terms of use, as well follow all trademark guidelines dictated by the platform.</p>
<p>After looking at the early API pioneers, as well as the leading social APIs, and each of their approaches to delivering partner programs, you start seeing the possible motivations behind the leading partner programs&mdash;not all partner and developer programs are created equal. While all these API leaders have been working on their own version of their partner programs, one company came along and forever changed how developer programs could work.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apple/apple-logo.gif" alt="" width="90" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Apple</strong><br /> To meet the demand for mobile applications, Apple developed their own&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/">developer program</a>, allowing developers to select an enrollment type of individual or organization, submit their applications, then purchase and activate their developer accounts&mdash;allowing them to develop, test then distribute apps via the App Store. The Apple Developer Program doesn&rsquo;t just give developers ability to publish in the App Store, then generate revenue for Apple through app purchases, it open up access for developers to be ability to partake in in-app purchases, iAd rich media ads, volume purchases and take advantage of custom B2B app opportunities. Apple's approach gave us all the app marketplace model to apply in our own API ecosystems, and also provides a model for partnership that is less about just developers, apps and API access, and more about distribution to a leading mobile app ecosystem.</p>
<p>This post was triggered after me reading blog posts from Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn about changes to their partner programs. But after diving into more research, I ended up having a conversation about potential blueprints for API partner programs within our federal government. Unfortunately there are very few models for this new type of API driven partnerships in our federal government, but two existing programs I think come close, are from the USPS and IRS.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/become-an-integrator.htm" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/usps/usps-logo.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>USPS<a href="https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/become-an-integrator.htm" target="_blank"></a></strong><br /> As with other API providers, the <a href="https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/become-an-integrator.htm">United States Postal Service (USPS) Web Tools Integrator program</a> is more about identifying quality developer talent, than it is about access to API resources. To be part of the USPS Web Tools Integrator program, developers just need to read the policy guide, agree to all the terms and conditions, register, request to be listed, then await verification and approval by USPS developer program staff. With the USPS example we are getting closer to the precedent I&rsquo;m looking for, but really falls short in all the characteristics I&rsquo;m hoping to see in a federal government API partner program.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/e-File-Providers-&amp;-Partners/Become-an-Authorized-e-file-Provider" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/irs/bw-irs-logo.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>IRS</strong><br /> The only model for API partnerships between the federal government and the private sector is the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/e-File-Providers-&amp;-Partners/Become-an-Authorized-e-file-Provider">IRS, Authorized e-File Provider program</a>.  The IRS provides developers with planning tools to help them determine their eligibility, the ability to submit an application, which before approval must pass an application suitability check, business background check, as well as individual background checks, which requires being fingerprinted by a trained professional.</p>
<p>Like the USPS example, the IRS partner program still isn't 100% of what I&rsquo;m looking for, but for now it is the best we have, and is something that really resonates within government circles. My goal in continuing this research is to provide my audience with leading examples of API partner programs from the private sector, but I also am looking to stimulate conversation within the federal government about what API partner programs might look like.</p>
<p>Looking through the approaches by Salesforce, Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and even USPS and the IRS, give me a good idea of the common motivations for deploying a partner program within an API developer ecosystem, as well as some of the building blocks that are necessary to be successful. the partner programs I've reviewed are primarily about identifying the best developers and applications within API ecosystems, that businesses can leverage when integrating with these platforms. Apple and Salesforce brings some interesting audience reach, and distribution opportunities for developers, but the IRS is the only one that comes close to what I&rsquo;m looking for, in that they use partner program to control who has access to API resources, including the ability to write data to the platform--I think this will be key to other federal government APis.</p>
<p>Overall I think there are things to be learned from all of the APIs listed above. This is why I spend time going through their programs, in hopes of understanding all the best practices available in deploying successful API partner programs. Hopefully you can use my research in your own API partnership efforts, whether your are looking to deploy an API partner program in the public or the private sector.</p>
