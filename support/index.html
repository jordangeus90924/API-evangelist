<p>I depend o the support of my partners to do what I do. I am an independent analyst monitoring the API space. I have been doing this since July of 2010 because of the support of various partners, and writing or consulting projects along the way.</p>

<p>3Scale, Restlet, and WSO2 are my primary support partners covering most of my operating expenses, and travel, keeping me focused on what I do best--researching, coding, and sharing stories on the API Evangelist network.</p>

<p>If you appreciate what I do at API Evangelist, and would like to support my work, I have several ways that I encourage support.</p>

<p>If there is a specific research area you would like to see funded, let me know. I work to stay focused on research that moves the API conversation forward, and benefits the entire community. It is important there is open research available to help people make sense of APIs, and understand where to get started, and improve their efforts.</p>
<p>I have been doing this for five years, as of summer of 2015, and look forward to the next five years through your support.</p>
