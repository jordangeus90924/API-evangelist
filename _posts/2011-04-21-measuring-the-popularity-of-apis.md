{% include JB/setup %}<p>How do you measure the popularity of your API, or someone elses API?If its your API, hopefully you have metrics established for every part of your API and supporting API area.But how can we measure the API space as a whole?I get asked a lot about, what are the top APIs out there.ProgrammableWeb measures popularity by the number of mashups that are built on an API.</p>
