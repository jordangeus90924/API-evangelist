			<p><em>19 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>Audrey (@audreywatters) forwarded a very interesting series of tweets to me yesterday from software artist, writer, and educator Jer Thorp (@blprnt): Has anyone written about APIs as art objects? &mdash; blprnt (@blprnt) March 18, 2013 (We make APIs for almost every art project we build - in some ways the APIs themselves are the most interesting/poetic parts) &mdash; blprnt (@blprnt) March 18, 2013 It feels to me the API could become a medium for artists in the same way that the algorists embraced the algorithm in the 70s. &mdash; blprnt (@blprnt) March 18, 2013 The APIists. You heard it here first. &mdash; blprnt (@blprnt) March 18, 2013 The API's ability to bridge platforms/devices/languages is almost inherently interventionist. &mdash; blprnt (@blprnt) March 18, 2013 What a fascinating thought. It is so close to how I see APIs in my minds eye. A single API design can hold so much beauty, information, expression and emotion. Imagine if you hung the API design for each iteration of the Twitter API on a wall. There is so much to interpret. It expresses the vision of Twitter founders and employees, it is in direct response to a million developers and the needs of 500 million users around the globe. &nbsp;What an impression!!! While JSON might be the only way we have to visually describe an API, each web, mobile app and data visualization could also be considered an artistic representation of the Twitter API. You could fill an entire gallery with JSON representations of each endpoint and each of its versions, applications, and visualizations. Creating interactive art exhibition of the Twitter ecosystem. I remember back in 8th grade(1984) I was in my social studies class with Ms. Schuler. She brought in some fractal prints, she said were created by her mathematician boyfriend. She walked us through how each visual was actually a math problem. This was the same year my math teacher Mr. Hathaway got around 20 Commodore Vic 20s,...[<a href="/2013/03/19/apis-as-art/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>18 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I would say the most common path to an API is from your company's database.  This makes database to API connectors, tools and services a pretty valuable area of the API space.  While there will always be high profile APIs dominating the tech blogosphere, most APIs will be launched quietly from small companies, by connecting them to various internal data sources.
During API Strategy &amp; Practice, I met a new API service provider, called SlashDB, that focuses on just delivering APIs from your database.  Once installed on any web server, SlashDB connects your internal databases and constructs a REST/HTTP web service, easily making database content accessible by URLs for getting, updating, inserting and deleting in a secure way.
SlashDB provides connectors for Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostGreSQL, IBM DB2 and Sybase--covering the top 5 databases you will find in the enterprise or small to medium businesses.
I notice that SlashDB also has Microsoft Excel connectors.  I will have to investigate this further and do another story on API deployment from Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  I know this will sound insane to the RESTafarians, but I think much of the worlds data is locked up in spreadsheets, on individual computers, throughout companies around the globe.
I've added SlashDB to my list of next generation API service providers like EmergentOne, API Spark and API Engine. &nbsp;Check it out, and let me know what you think.

			<p>This post is more rant, and about me working through my thoughts on this subject, which is why its on kinlane.com and not apievangelist.com or apivoice.com. &nbsp;This post is an aggregation of ongoing thoughts I'm having around my role in the API space, a diagram I drew the other day while enjoying an IPA, and inescapable thoughts fueled up by a post by&nbsp;Patrick Meir over at iRevolution, called Crisis Mapping, Neogeography and the Delusion of Democratization. &nbsp; Meir kicks up a bunch of thoughts related to how I perceive my role in the API space, which I believe is to help keep a certain amount of oxygen (aka open) present in the space, which I believe is the key ingredient in why the expirement we know as APIs is working. &nbsp;At first glance, API Evangelist looks like just a blog, but in reality it is a pretty complex system of data stores, API connectors, jobs and curation that I'm using to help draw a map of the API space that I can follow. Currently it looks something like this: The way I see the space, is there are a shitload of resources, awaiting to be exposed via APIs that are both public and private resources. The stewards of these resources have the ability to select from tools and resources to deploy their API resources, using various building blocks for accomplishing this. API as a ServiceAdditional to standing up your own API, there is the phenonmenon known as BaaS, PaaS and SaaS. &nbsp;Many of these platforms can actually help you deploy API resources, while also consuming and deploying resources of their own. &nbsp;For example, Kinvey allows you to deploy generic APIs from data stores you setup on their BaaS platform, bt they also consume API resources and makes available to you from eBay, and other places, while also providing you with their own API resources that you can use to rapidly deploy mobile apps.

			<p><em>16 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>Audrey came to me last night and said she had a project that she wanted to tackle, using the CrunchBase API. She wanted to pull a list of education startups that were founded in 2010-2012, showing their investments, CEO, founders and other related company information. A couple weeks ago, I helped Audrey download a PHP Twitter bot, reverse engineer and make it work for an objective she had around Tweeting random responses to a certain type of tweet. I figured she was ready to see what it took to hack on an API and get the research data she needed. Audrey wanted to pull a list of startups that were educated related. We started with the /search endpoint, using the query keyword &ldquo;education&rdquo;. The query parameter appears to search the title, tags and overview of each Crunchbase entry, pulling way more than what we needed, 5700 in total. Each search returned 10 startups, with a handful of fields for each company, not nearly enough information. To prove we could get what we needed, we took the first startup returned, grabbed the name and used it to perform a company /entity search, returning a wealth of information. We had what we were looking for including date founded, amount raised, CEO, founders as well as description, logos, addresses and other vital company information. Back to the /search endpoint. Each search only returned 10 results, when there were actually 5,700. I looked at the documentation and the only parameter listed, was &ldquo;query&rdquo;. No way to control how many results returned, paginate or otherwise. So I start guessing, appending page=, and max=, maxrows=, anything to get more results. Eventually I was able to change the page, so I was able to write logic to loop through each page, getting at all the results required. For each returned result from the /search endpoint, I would take the company name and perform a company search on the /entity endpoint.

			<p><em>16 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Next generation payment provider Braintree just launched a new JavaScript library that helps  merchants reduce their PCI scope in a flexible and testable way, which they are calling appropriately&nbsp;Braintree.js.  According to Braintree, the library:
...uses asymmetric encryption to prevent raw credit card data from passing through merchants' servers. It intercepts a form submit in the browser that contains sensitive data, encrypts that data with a public key provided to merchants by Braintree and then submits the form with the encrypted data to the server. Braintree retains the private key of the key pair so that merchants are unable to decrypt the encrypted fields server-side. Any string field in Braintree's API can be encrypted and encrypted values can be transparently dropped into any API call
I&rsquo;m a big supporter of what I call a healthy embeddable strategy, which includes buttons, badges, widgets and other tools you can build on top of an API or to support API integration.
With the rise in populartiy of JavaScript, and the growth of platforms like Node.js, I predict that providing your API developers with standardized JS libraries that extend the value of your API will become commonplace.
I&rsquo;m going to add a section to my embeddable building blocks, for JavaScript libraries. I&rsquo;m seeing more API providers doing cool stuff in this area.  I will try and record as much of it as I can during my industry monitoring each week and provide resources for you to follow.
I&rsquo;ve talked about the potential of markup APIs and scripting platforms&nbsp;in the past, which I think is a related example to what Braintree is doing--in which you can build JS libraries for your API users and extend not just the reach of the value generated by your APIs, but the expertise of your team.

			<p><em>15 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
This story comes from Phil Leggetter (@leggetter) over at Pusher.  Its about a client of theirs, cisimple, which provides continuous delivery services for mobile developers.  cisimple just released a new API, which gives mobile developers more control over the build processes for their mobile applications.
Using the cisimple API you can kick off new builds and download artifacts from your mobile dev process.  cisimple is a very interesting API resource, that I will definitely be watching, and I&rsquo;m sure I will be writing about in the near future.  But what I really think is interesting is that cisimple is allowing clients to register for real-time updates via Pusher channels, using API tokens.
This means that when you use cisimple to manage your mobile development, you now have a real-time push system that will send notifications when builds start, pass, fail, etc.  This opens up a whole world of human integration with the build process via desktop and mobile notifications, but also can be used in other systems that play a role in your dev cycles.
The weaving of a Pusher real-time notification layer into the cisimple API is pretty innovative. Something I&rsquo;m sure will deliver huge value to their customers.   But think of the potential as a standard approach for all API owners?  You could offer developers real-time notifications about their own usage of your API, providing them with an intimate view of how their application(s) are using an API.  Addiitionally it seems like you could set up a pretty interesting system wide notification layer that would let you, as the API owner, establish notification channels regarding overall API usage, thresholds and other important signals from your platform.
As I continue to dive into the world of real-time APIs, I&rsquo;m surprised at the multiple ways in which we can truly deliver real-time value using APIs.  cisimple API + Pusher is in interesting addition.

			<p><em>15 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>Maciej Ceglowskiis, the founder of popular social bookmarking platform Pinboard,made an interesting proposal over on the Pinboard Google Group: I've been thinking about imposing an API tax, the proceeds of which would go into improving API infrastructure and offsetting operating costs, structured along these lines: API free to use for your own Pinboard account Every API client making requests on behalf of someone else must register an app identifier $20/year tax if your app makes requests for over 100 Pinboard accounts $100/year tax if your app makes requests for over 1000 Pinboard accounts Possibly additional price levels to waive certain rate limits Think of it as a road tax that then pays for further construction, repair, and people in orange vests. I&rsquo;m guessing that Maciej has a lot of experience to back his proposal, watching how developers use Pinboard for their own purposes, or on behalf of a user via a client. I heavily depend on Pinboard for my curation at API Evangelist, so API access would remain free for me. I&rsquo;m not sure how I would feel if I was building a client. On the forum, there is very interesting feedback from Matt Schmidt, developer of PinDroid, the leading Pinboard client for Android: I'm very much against this. Why would you tax the makers of the apps that help drive use of your product, rather than the users themselves? To extend your road use tax analogy, this is like taxing the car companies for their customer's use of the roads. I offer PinDroid as a free, open source app and have no interest in making money off it, but I also have no interest in losing money on it. Why not offer api access as a premium account feature (like archiving) for an extra buck instead? To be clear, if such a "tax" were to be implemented, I will have to stop developing and supporting PinDroid and take it off the market.

			<p><em>15 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
In May 2011 I released a book called the Business of APIs. The book was intended to be an introductory walkthrough for non-technical people, to the world of APIs. I wanted to educate business, organizational and governmental leaders about the space, and the important role of APIs in having a healthy digital strategy.
Its coming up on two years later, and I'm finally getting around to updating the Business of APIs. After a nice long walk on the strand with @audreywatters, we have the outline for the next version:

What is an API?
What are APIs used for?
The history of APIs
What goes into an API?
Do you need an API?
How do you get an API??
What are the common building blocks of an API?
What are possible business models for an API?
How do you evangelize and support an API?
Where have some APIs stumbled?
APIs, a new way of doing business

The goal of the Business of APIs is the same. Help anyone, from any company, organization or the government understand what an API is, and why they are important. &nbsp;You don't have to be a developer to put APIs to use, this book is for everyone.
Look for an updated version of the Business of APIs by June. I'll still keep it a simple guide to the space, but provide a whole lot more information that will help you understand the Business of APIs.

I ended up at the Punfork API today for some reason. Full disclosure: "Punchfork has been acquired by Pinterest! Read the announcement. Site shutdown: March 31st, 2013".  Just getting that out of the way. While at the site, I ended up at the Goodies page, which I think represents a nice set of basic embeddable tools for an API.
First using Punchfork Badges, you can customize a badge, then copy and paste the embed code onto your blog's sidebar, or anywhere else you want it to appear:

Then you can download a Punchfork logo (ok, its just one, but it gets point across):

Last, you can enter your address and request a Punchfork sticker to be sent to you:

These are all three, simple examples of a good approach to providing embeddable tools for users.  Badges are pretty straightforward, and it is sensible to provide logos and other images as part of a healthy branding strategy.  But the request for a sticker is something I haven't added to my listing of embeddable building blocks. After thinking about it, stickers are the OG embeddable tool.  Something your users can take offline, and embed anywhere.
At some point I will do a roundup of all the embeddable building blocks, since I've been adding some new ones like sticker request form.

			<p><em>14 Mar 2013</em></p>

I see a lot of new API platforms emerge, and often times you see them deploying their own solutions to problems that are actively solved by top API platforms, and are already adopted by common mobile and web app users.
The best example of this is with authentication.  Its growing more and more common that you don&rsquo;t build your own login, you use Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google or Github oAuth.
It seems to me that when it comes to other common resources, the same could be applied.  So I&rsquo;m exploring what my essential stack of API driven resources might look like:
Messages



















Photos












Documents








Videos











Notes







Bookmarks








Blog











Contacts











Checkins








Audio







Calendar







Payments












Advertising















URL Shortener







I could do quite a bit with this assembled as a single backend stack, if it included a regular datastore, key-value store, user management and other essentials for building apps.
It seems to me that new platforms shouldn&rsquo;t always create new silos, but bridge the existing ones that we depend on already.

			<p><em>13 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Node.js, the server-side software system designed for writing scalable Internet applications in JavaScript, seems to be getting more attention lately from top API providers because of its event-driven, asynchronous I/O that can minimizeoverhead and maximize scalability.
Last week Google released an official Node.js client library for accessing Google APIs that supports authorization and authentication using OAuth 2.0.  Then earlier this week, Amazon Web Services announced that AWS Elastic Beanstalk, their PaaS solution now supports Node.js applications.
While Google&rsquo;s deployment is a client, and AWS&rsquo;s is an application platform, they both have the same objective--enabling developers to build highly reliable, scalable, and cost-effective applications using APIs.
Both Google and AWS recognize the potential for selling developers their valuable API driven resources, by providing them with Node.js solutions.  JavaScript is the number one language on Github, with Node dominating most starred and most forked overall categories, according to Github trends.
I think that AWS and Github both send a good signal to other API owners, that they need to step up the availablity of Node.js resources for their API developer communities.

			<p><em>13 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>One of the best aspects of being the API Evangelist, is I get to hang out with smart folks, doing gaming changing things across all business sectors. Last week I was able to make it to the API Social, an event held in Berkeley by a group of API savvy faculty members. This is my third one, and the group is up to some very interesting things. I had a conversation with one UC Berkeley analyst about a problem that isn&rsquo;t just unique to a university, but they are working on an innovative solution for. The problem: UCB Developers are creating Web Services that provide access to sensitive data (e.g. grades, transcripts, current enrollments) but only trusted applications are typically allowed to access these Web Services to prevent misuse of the sensitive data. Expanding access to these services, while preserving the confidentiality of the data, could provide student and third party developers with opportunities to create new applications that provide UCB students with enhanced services. The solution: Wrapping untrusted applications in a "Proxied Facade Service" framework that passes anonymous tickets through the &ldquo;untrusted&rdquo; application to underlying services that can independently extract the necessary personal information provides a secure way of allowing an application to retrieve a Web User&rsquo;s Business data (e.g. their current course enrollments) WITHOUT exposing any identifying information about the user to the untrusted application. I find their problem and solution fascinating, I also think it is something that could have huge potential. When data leaves any school, healthcare provider, financial services or government office, the presence of sensitive data is always a concern. More data will be leaving these trusted systems, for use in not just apps, but also for analysis and visualizations, and the need to scrub personally identifiable information will only grow. I&rsquo;m still processing everything the team at UC Berkeley is doing, but want to write about as I&rsquo;m wrapping my head around it. If you know of any...[<a href="/2013/03/13/an-api-that-scrubs-personally-identifiable-information-from-other-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>12 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
It looks like the HTML5 document embedding platform Crocodoc is starting to plan the next version of their API.  The are being very transparent about the process (which I like), and putting out the word looking for some new team members to help them get the job one.
Over the next couple weeks they want build an API that is simple and easy to use, but also capable of handling tens of millions of document conversations a month.  To help get the job done they are looking for:

Sales Engineers - Boots on the ground to let them know what people want and to help us engage the developer community
JavaScript Engineers - Help them open source the demos we build and design our client-side libraries
DevOps Engineers - Help them build the infrastructure we use to convert millions of documents each month

I found the Crocodoc posting on Hacker News, but I&rsquo;m writing about because I appreciate API owner sending out signals that they are planning the next version of their API.  This type of transparancy is not just important in helping you find talent to make it happen, it sends a signal to the community that you are beginning a planning cycle and can encourage community feedback and involvement. &nbsp;&nbsp;
The Crocodoc API reworking sounds like a pretty innovative project to work on, and the Crocodoc team looks like a pretty smart team to get a chance to work with.

			<h3><a href="/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">Netflix API Is Much More Than A Public API</a></h3>
			<p><em>12 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>Netflix has entered the final stages of shuttering its public API last week. Its been coming for a while now, starting in June of 2012, and now is official with the platform no longer accepting new API registrations. After reading about the changes to the Netflix Public API program on their blog, and hearing much of the news in response, everyone seems to file this away, along with the Twitter API--just another API platform screwing over its developers. As I do, I wanted to take a step back, look at the bigger picture and try understand what happened. &nbsp;On October 1st 2008, Netflix launched their public API, and they appear to have done everything right. They had a blog, solicited code samples from developers, accepted application submissions and even showcased the developers apps in the gallery. Netflix would even help promote your app to Netflix subscribers and threw hackathons. The Netflix API team worked to improve API performance, communicate regularly, but really nothing that amazing happened. There were applications like InstaWatcher and WhichFlicks&nbsp;(among others)&nbsp;developed on the API, but as Daniel Jacobson puts it, a thousand flowers didn&rsquo;t bloom. In these situations its easy to blame the API provider, but developers didn&rsquo;t really step up and build anything that innovative and cool. So is this a failure of Netflix? A failure of developers to innovate? Or could it possibly be a third: failure of the API vision? I would say the demise of the Netflix public API is equal part Netflix and the developer, and just the nature of the industry it exists in. It didn&rsquo;t take me long to look through the Netflix API blog, so I can tell they didn&rsquo;t put alot into evangelizing the API. But I really can&rsquo;t find any innovation that occurred by developers as part of it, so I think us devs have to share some of the responsibility as well. Several of the blog posts covering the news last...[<a href="/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>12 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
When it came to API focused events, the only conference there was to attend was the Business of APIs Conference, from Mashery.  They have been putting on the conference(correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong) since 2007.  There wasn&rsquo;t much of an "API Industry" back then, and Mashery was definitely the pioneer in the space, getting the word out and along with ProgrammableWeb, has done a lot to define the API space.
Fast forward five years, and after the successful API Strategy &amp; Practice in February (originally scheduled for November), there are now five API event series going on:



















It is exciting to see the explosion of events, and I&rsquo;m hopeful regarding how much progress will occur in 2013 with this many conversations going on.  It is also promising to see the international growth, with Nordic APIs happening in Scandinavia, API Days coming from France, Business of APIs in London and API Summit spreading the conversation from United States and Australia.
With this amount of buzz, APIs will definitely continue its spread to the mainstream.  My only hope is that all the events make sure and represent the space well by being interoperable and sharing content, speakers and ideas openly so that the entire industry benefits.

			<h3><a href="/2013/03/10/soa-vs-api-the-humans-win/">SOA vs API - The Humans Win</a></h3>
			<p><em>10 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>As the API movement marches forward, it continues to grind against the enterprise and its legacy of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), which increases the frequency at which people ask me, What is the difference between API and SOA? This is not a technical explanation of the differences, but a philosophical one that many will argue does not apply, but in my opinion is the dark matter around the technological and business approach of SOA, that makes API work. Many say that a web API is just one component in an SOA toolbox. This is true. Using HTTP for an API is not that novel in itself. That is until it jumped out of the enterprise petri dish, got a little oxygen to grow, allowing the introduction of some new aspects that the industry and technology overlords of SOA would never have introduced on their own. While reading the Nation Building in the Age of APIs, by Matt McLarty (@MattMcLartyBC) of Layer7 today, he reminded me that: "Every paradigm shift in technology has been driven by both innovation&mdash;the new technology itself&mdash;and application&mdash;how that technology can be used. In other words, there is a machine side and a people side to every technology change. The technologists responsible for implementing these changes often bias towards their comfort zone&mdash;the machine side&mdash;and overlook the people side." He is right. &nbsp;APIs moves us closer to the people side of the equation, outside the technologists comfort zone, but I would also add that it moves it outside the business and industry leaderships comfort zone, introducing more balance that has the potential to make online communities, platforms and ecosystem thrive. Matt continues to say: "Ultimately, the success of a company&rsquo;s API will depend on the creation of a diverse community for that API&mdash;end users, partners, developers, and more&mdash;as well as the adoption of a business model that allows the API to contribute to the company&rsquo;s bottom line." SOA does a damn fine job...[<a href="/2013/03/10/soa-vs-api-the-humans-win/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
As the API Evangelist, I&rsquo;ve made it my mission to go outside of the Silicon Valley bubble and educate the &ldquo;normals&rdquo; about the potential of APIs.  In doing this I have conversations with a wide range of folks from new startups, to the GSA in Washington DC.  One growing trend I&rsquo;m seeing is the number of VC and angel investors reaching out, to have me help them understand the API space and how it applies to their investments.
I have a couple VC&rsquo;s I talk to on a regular basis, but I have a growing number of new ones who are investing more and more in technology companies and need to get a grip on this API world.  As a Terry Kearns from Oxford Strategic Advisors, LLC,&nbsp;put it yesterday:
"I wanna let you know I appreciate all the work you've done here. For a guy who is not a tech guy. You really help me out with a lot, your articles and information help me get my arms around this whole API world"
That is my mission.  This is what I do.  Nobody pays me to educate people like this about the APIs space, but it is so critical that the folks who are investing in the next generation of healthcare, education, manufacturing and other business sectors, understand APIs, at least at a basic level.
APIs are part of fundamental change in how we conduct business, not just in technology sector, but EVERY aspect of our government, business and even our personal lives.  Let me know how I can answer questions about your existing investment portfolio or regarding business sectors you are looking to invest in.
Make sure your companies truly understand APIs, and you are making educated investments.

			<p><em>07 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Are you ready for more discussions about APIs?  I know I am. :) This time its from our Scandinavian friends, with four events in 2013.  Nordic APIs is a series of conferences and events held across Scandinavia which provides knowledge and information about APIs.
API Evangelist is a supporter of Nordic APIs, and you will find me speaking at the 2 day event in Stockholm in September.  I will be speaking with Adam DuVander(@adamd) and John Musser(@johnusser) of ProgrammableWeb, Jacob Ideskog (@jacobideskog) and Travis Spencer (@travisspencer) of Twobo Technologies, as well as the notorious Andreas Krohn (@andreaskrohn).
I feel an awakening happening around APIs, and its not just a Silicon Valley thing.  People around the globe are becoming more aware of the potential of APIs.  I'm getting more and more requests from Europe and South America for API education, resources and tools.
We need to support as many of these open, vendor neutral conversations about APIs as we can.  The Nordic APIs series is looking for sponsors and support.  If your company is looking to break into Scandinavia, you should be supporting Nordic APIs, because its guaraneed to be a couple hundred of the smartest folks across the Scandanavian API space assembled in one building.
Head over to Nordic APIs site and contact them directly to see how you can support the conversations that will be occurring across Scandavia, and I look forward to seeing you there.

			<p><em>06 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m working through lists of APIs and API service providers who I&rsquo;ve rated pretty highly because of their work in the past, but red flags have gone up because I&rsquo;ve haven&rsquo;t seen a blog post, tweet or commit from them lately. One of the service providers I&rsquo;m reviewing is Zypr, which providers voice enabled architecture built on popular APIs. Zypr fits in with my vision of where APIs are going, because Zypr is doing the same thing as aggregation, automation and other trending service providers, but the end goal is this use case is voice. In Zyprs own words: Zypr aggregates proprietary 3rd party APIs, categorizes their functions, and then presents those functions through a single, normalized API. By aggregating and normalizing 3rd party APIs, Zypr creates a stable access point for devices and apps to access those services without concern for service and API changes. That sounds exactly like what Singly is doing, but with voice as the vehicle for making valuable API resources avilable on apps running via mobile phones, tablets and in our cars and homes. I really like the Zypr graphic. I will have to create a similar version to articulate some the API trends I&rsquo;m seeing. I hope Zypr is just heads down, working hard on their platform. According to my API stack rank, there aren&rsquo;t very many positive signals coming out of the platform: Last Blog Post - 09/28/2012 Last Tweet - 01/30/2013 Last Commit - 10 months ago What Zypr is doing is important--I hope they have enough runway to make happen. &nbsp;If they need to cut corners, they shouldn't replicate the service or client adapter portion of their platform, they could just partner with an existing API aggregators&nbsp;like Singly for these layers, as well as reciprocity providers like Elastic.io or Foxweave to migrate and tranform data. &nbsp;In my opinion Zypr should focus on how their engine works, and partner and generate open source to build the rest....[<a href="/2013/03/06/api-driven-voice-architecture/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>05 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
It was interesting to see Amazon step up in the advertising game with the beta release of the Amazon Mobile Ads API this week.  I wouldn&rsquo;t want Amazon getting into my space, when it comes to any API resource, especially advertising.  On the other hand, one can say that the space needs disruption with the dominance of Google with their multiple offerings:


Google Mobile
Google Adwords
DoubleClick
DoubleClick Ad Exchange
AdMob
Adwords
Youtube

I think we can expect some intense competition when it comes to advertising and specifically around mobile advertising APIs--battling for your eyeballs on smart phones and tablets in 2013.
Another layer that will add to the competititiveness with advertising APIs is the fact that all three social media and networking giants have their own advertising APIs now as well:


Facebook
Twitter
LinkedIn

With Google and Amazon both having devices in the game (Android and Kindle), it will be interesting how they partner with Facebook, Twitter or Linkedin for the social layer, and where all of this leaves Apple.
Let&rsquo;s not forget about the  me too category with Bing Advertising APIs and Yahoo Advertising Central, or the potentially over 100 other advertising APIs available via ProgrammableWeb.
Any way you look at it, 2013 will prove to be a very competitive landscape when it comes to web and mobile advertising, with so many heavyweight contenders with their own devices and API driven advertising platforms.  I think an advertising API roundup is in order, in the near future.
I just hope that we start thinking beyond advertising when it comes to APIs and the monetization of web and mobile apps in 2013.

			<p><em>05 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m a little behind in working through my list of new APIs to review.  So I&rsquo;m spending about 3 hours each day going through my list of new APIs accumulated from ProgrammableWeb, Tweets, Bookmarks, Google Alerts and other ways I have for discovering new APIs.
After looking&nbsp;through a couple hundred APIs, I&nbsp;wanted to share some things that stand out, and make me feel someone really doesn't give a shit when they hit publish on their API:

Your entire developer area is a PDF
Really long, incoherent URL for dev area
Dev area is just a page in your help directory
You put google ads on every page of your API documentation
No communication, support or contact information at all
Sign up form that pops up in my face as soon as page loads
Require an NDA before I register

These are just a handful of things that make me give an API a C or D grade, which means you probably aren&rsquo;t on my radar. &nbsp;But then again if you don't have active blog or twitter or developers aren't talking about you, your API won't register on the radar even with a B grade.
With tools like 3Scale, APIHub and Mashape out there, it isn&rsquo;t hard to hang your API in a professional way, with minimal amount of effort and resources.
After looking through hundreds of APIs I leave with the same feeling:  that there tons of good ideas out there, but 80% of them are just executed very poorly.

			<p><em>05 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m looking at new and innovative ways companies are building analytics and visualizations on top of APIs, and one of the new tools I&rsquo;ve come across is ImpactStory.  ImpactStory aggregates altmetrics:  diverse impacts from your articles, datasets, blog posts, and more.  But this post isn&rsquo;t about ImpactStory, I&rsquo;ll crunch what they do and write about in another post.

This post is about their usage of feedback, helpdesk, and knowledge base management tool&nbsp;UserVoice, which is a service I always recommend to API owners looking to support different aspects of their API community.
ImpactStory simply has a &ldquo;BETA - Send us Your Feedback&rdquo; image in the top right corner of their site.  When you click on the logo, you are presented with a simple UserVoice form for submitting your ideas of where you think ImpactStory should take their platform.

I think this is a pretty dead simple way of soliciting feedback from your community. Involving your users in your roadmap planning can go a long way in building goodwill with them, and encouraging participation and innovation in other ways.
After I spend more time playing with ImpactStory, I&rsquo;ll do another post on what else they are up to, but at first glance its a pretty interesting approach to developing tracking analytics, visualization and other embeddable goodness using APIs.

			<p><em>04 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve been following the great coverage by Paul MIller over at Cloud Ave about whether Infochimps running from the Data Market business, and Discussing Data Markets in New York City. He&rsquo;s touched on any interesting topic around the viability of data markets as a business, and the fate of several of the most high profile players in the space. In 2011, when it comes to data API marketplaces and providers I tended to showcase players like Factual, Kasabi, DataMarket and InfoChimps. In 2013, we&rsquo;ve watched Kasabi disappear, and the migration of InfoChimps from an open data market, to a enterprise data platform. While Factual and Datamarket appear to be going strong. I think this reflects a common, lack of imagination by Silicon Valley because they are so focused on making money, they miss the need to support critical aspects of industries, that are required to allow for the growth they want to see. While I feel there is money to be made off data marketplaces, however right now I think it is critical that we invest in people standing up and exposing data, not just focusing on making money off this process at levels that VC&rsquo;s deem adequate. I make the same argument with API providers, its not that there isn&rsquo;t money in standing up APIs, but we need to heavily invest in the education of potential API owners and the healthy standing up of APIs. &nbsp; There will be plenty of money down the road from APIs and data marketplaces, but by always looking at it through a Silicon Valley perspective, we are going to stifle the oxygen necessary for a truly healthy, vibrant space. I&rsquo;m spending time looking through the API service provider space, and last week I noticed the big gap in there being API deployment services vs. API management services. This imbalance is due to a gold rush by heavily VC funded API service providers looking to capitalize on the enterprise...[<a href="/2013/03/04/short-sighted-silicon-valley-limits-potential-of-data-markets/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>API driven analytics and visualizations is one of the new areas&nbsp;of API usage I'm tracking on. There are many &ldquo;big data&rdquo; platforms emerging these days, but I&rsquo;m looking for dead simple tools and services anyone can use to generate analytics and visualizations via APIs. Think of reciprocity providers like IFTT, Zapier and Elastic.io. These new API driven service providers, make it easy to migrate data between cloud services, using a simple set of source API, triggers, actions and target APIs--with a dead simple icon and wizard based UI, allowing any user to put the platform to work. I want this approach for embeddable analytics, visualizations and other widgets that are easily generated via APIs. Last week I came across a new platform called Ducksboard, which allows you to easily generate some pretty sophisticated analytical widgets from common API sources. The platform even comes with a marketplace where you can find other widgets. The only problem is that Duckboards is meant to generate dashboards, and not really open and portable widgets. &nbsp;We'll keep an eye on this platform, see where it goes. Then last night I came across Keen IO, an analytics Backend as a Service (BaaS) platform that lets developers build analytics features directly into their apps, from common API services. Keen IO provides a pretty sophisticated workbench for building embeddable charts, metrics and other analytics or visualizations that you can render anywhere, using iOS, Android, JavaScript, Ruby, Python and Java libraries they provide. At first glance, this space can feel just like earlier waves of widget building platforms of the Web 1.0 &amp; 2.0 worlds. But I think we hadn&rsquo;t reached critical mass, in the number of available API resources, as well as an awareness of APIs in general, in order to realize the true potential of widgets. I think we are getting closer in 2013. I&rsquo;m optistic that a new breed of API driven analytics and visualization tools will emerge making dead simple,...[<a href="/2013/03/04/next-generation-of-api-driven-analytics-and-visualizations/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Hands on, interactive tools are proving to be the most useful way to learn about an API--empowering users to see it in action, and witness the value it delivers.  Many companies are doing this by providing API explorers, consoles, interactive documentation and other hands-on tools that allow you to see how any API actually functions and learn about the API in realtime.
One of the latest companies to do this is MMS API provider Mogreet, which has stepped into the API explorer game with their own API tester allowing anyone to visually build an API call that sends multimedia messages, as well as take advantage of the 25 other methods available via the API platform.

The API tester is available for all users via the developer dashboard, providing a hands on way to learn about the Mogreet API, all available endpoints, understand which parameters are required or optional, experiment with alternatives and quickly make the calls and see the result, understanding the value and operations before you get to work coding around the API.
While I think using an API explorer like Apigee&rsquo;s can provide value, but I also recommend rolling your own toolkits that might speak specifically to your target audience.  I think a standard API console or explorer can help developers understand the operations of an API, but I think the right GUI tool can help any user understand the potential your API offers.  Which might make the difference between an integration project getting funded or not, with decision makers properly understanding how your API can be put to use.
Nice work Mogreet team!

			<p><em>04 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>How to structure pricing for an API is one of the top 5 questions I get from people who are currently planning their API strategy. In my opinion, there is, and never will be a one size fits all API pricing strategy. What you charge for your API resources should reflect their value and how they are accessed and used by your target consumers. The Backend as a Service (BaaS) space is working hard to differentiate themselves in 2013 with different approaches to pricing of mobile backend resources. Amazon is still shaking up the API space with new services, pricing models and the price reduction of API resources at a dizzying pace. I had the pleasure of meeting the Apicultur team while in Paris for API Days&nbsp;last October. Apicultur is a linguistics API platform, that is pushing the boundaries of what is an API platform as well as how you price language API resources. Apicultur recently shared some of the thinking behind the current version of their platform pricing&nbsp;where they&nbsp;structure the price depending on three factors: Complexity of the API - Some APIs perform a very simple task (like removing commas from a text) while others deal with more complex task (like extracting if the opinion expressed in a particular text is positive or negative)--the "bigger" the API, the pricier it gets Speed - The max speed by default is one call per second. In order to get more calls per second, Apicultur ask for a prepayment that is discounted from the final price at the end of the month (i.e., is not an extra price, is just a prepayment as a commitment). In addition, there's a discount at the end of the month for users for those who get a speed limit feature Support -&nbsp;The basic support offered is the community support. For more support, special fees are offered Apicultur feels that by keeping the everything priced at 10,000 API calls, keeps things easy...[<a href="/2013/03/04/api-pricing-on-complexity-speed-and-support-at-apicultur/">Read More</a>]</p>

I stumbled across the Twitter Counter API in my monitoring for the API Stack this morning.  The Twitter Counter API allows you to retrieve key metrics on any Twitter account like username, url and avatar. &nbsp;All data you can get via the Twitter API, but with Twitter Counter API you get additional information like account growth statistics and ranking, that Twitter doesn't provide at all.
I find it fascinating that someone can build an API to augment an existing API, which is why I keep talking about it, I guess :) We are seeing a more standardized version of this with API aggregation providers like Singly and Adigami, where they not only aggregate APIs from a variety of sources, they also build entirely new APIs based the added value that is created after they are brought together.
Thinking about if further, it would be cool if you could submit your API to be listed in your parent API providers API area.   Think of APIhub and Mashape, but every API area would have its own 3rd API marketplace.  API providers often allow 3rd party developers to submit code libraries and samples to be listed as resources, as well as applications for listing in an application showcase. So it makes sense to potetially allow for your developers to submit APIs for validation and publishing into a designated area.
It seems to me that we shouldn&rsquo;t exist as islands, we should be able to invite in other API resources built on top of our APIs, or that compliment our APIs.  We should also have terms of use and pricing models that invite others to take our API resources and deploy in other ecosystem, building the next wave of BaaS providers that will be delivering specialized stacks of resources for developers to efficiently build mobile and web apps.

			<p><em>02 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>I feel we have done a good job explaining what is an API, why people need APIs, and providing services to manage APIs, but we are falling short on delivering information, tools and services for deploying APIs. First I want to acknowledge that many companies have established IT resources, in the form of technology talent, and internal systems they can put to use when deploying APIs. This post isn&rsquo;t for you. This is about individual problem owners looking to deploy APIs, who most likely have little or no access to traditional IT resources for a variety of reasons. You want to deploy an API, because you havplease some data, content or other resources you need to make accessible to partners or the public, allowing for integration into other systems or be used in the development of web or mobile applications or possibly even data analysis and visualizations. Machine Readable As much as I love APIs, I suggest everyone consider your overall objective behind launching an API. You may not need an API, you may just need to make your information machine readable and available on the open Internet. Technically, this isn&rsquo;t an API, but publishing your data or content in a machine readable format like XML or JSON can accomplish many of the same goals of an API, without the overhead of an API. Many tools you use every day like Microsoft Office, Google Apps, Salesforce provide tools for publishing data and content in machine readable formats like CSV, XML or JSON, much like publishing or printing as a PDF. Not everyone needs an API, but everyone needs to understand the how-to, and the benefits of making machine readable a default in all business, organization, government and even individual processes. PDF made data and content portable, for humans. But a PDF does very little good for other machines, websites and mobile apps.

			<p>There are numerous companies, with existing IT infrastructure, who are looking to deploy APIs in 2013. These companies will be deploying APIs using their existing technology teams, or depending on one of the 17 API management service providers available. This market is ripe for the 3Scale's of the world to provide valuable services to, but for many companies, organizations and government agencies who need to deploy APIs this year, API deployment will be about taking an existing database or multiple databases, and open them up to the public, partners, 3rd party developers or possibly just provide access to a remote department or branch of their company in the easiest way possible. Not all companies will have the resources, or the need to deploy full blown API programs. &nbsp;They just need a dead simple database to API solution that will quickly expose their data over the web in a secure way. Until recently this solution wasn&rsquo;t available in the cloud, but a new API service provider called Emergent One has stepped up to fill in the gap. Emergent One is a cloud service that allows you to connect to your company's MySQL, PostgreSQL or Amazon RDS databases, then generate a REST API from your existing data stores. Using Emergent One you can define a new API, connect to your database using an agent or direct connection, then define your API resources complete with meta data, sub-resources, in-line resources, fields and computed fields. Pretty much all you will need to make a clean web API from a database. Once you have your API resources defined, Emergent One provides you with a developer portal around these APIs, and the ability to provide developer registration, then issue keys they can use to access your data--providing the openness you desire, while keeping things secure and within your control. The developer portal is complete with documentation, explorer console and code libraries for iOS, Android and in Ruby.

			<p>Photo Credit: AVnet I try to keep API Evangelist a place where API newbies and API experts can both find what they are looking for. To meet this demand I&rsquo;m constantly moving the site around, trying to uncover more information, in a logical way that speaks to everyone. To change things up a little I moved a couple of the most important trends in APIs out of the trends section, and put them on the right hand menu, making them accessible from any page. There are four trends I think are important to how APIs are being used right now: Aggregation - Merging various APIs together into not just meaningful new stacks of resources, but entirely new resources, as a result of merging BaaS - The promise of Backend as a Service is to bundle together resources developers need to build mobile apps more efficiently. &nbsp;Some providers are rolling their own stacks, while others are using a hybrid approach with wise use of 3rd party API resources Reciprocity - The integration, interoperability, automation and transformation of data between cloud services, in a way that respects the relationshiop between user and platform, that uses APIs. Realtime - A realtime flow of data and resources using APIs and web technologies, meeting the demand of the API economy. I feel these areas will represent a shift in how APIs are deployed and consumed to meet the growing demand for the data and resources driving web and mobile applications. While the API should exist on its own, these areas represent an evolution in how APIs are bundled together into more meaningful stacks, new mashups of resources and providing the integration, interoperability, automation and real-time needs of businesses in the API economy. In addition to these four trends, I&rsquo;m looking at several other ways APIs are being used in new and potentially powerful ways: Voice - With the ubiquitous nature of mobile devices, voice is the next generation of discovering...[<a href="/2013/03/01/api-trends-i-am-watching/">Read More</a>]</p>

Right? I&rsquo;ve been watching API service providers evolve for the last three years, helping companies be successful in managing their APIs. But when you actually going through the list of service providers, looking for someone to help you deploy an API, there are very few options out of the box. The list of API Players coming from the enterprise: These enterprise players assume you will have existing infrastructure to publish web services, files and other message systems that they can connect with, to deploy your new APIs that you will manage. The most recent generation of API service providers: Are pretty much the same. While they may provide how to guides for deploying APIs on AWS, like 3Scale, the deployment of API endpoint is still your responsiblity. You need to have existing infrastructure that will do it, or find the REST framework of your choice--both requiring you have the appropriate talent and resources. Next up you can, deploy one of the open source API solutions, to proxy and manage your APIs: But again, you need the resources and know how to implement, and they are generally management tools, so you still need to &ldquo;launch&rdquo; your own API endpoint. When you start looking at the next generation of API service providers like Apiary.io, you can really maximize the design, planning, documentation and deployment cycle, but you still need to code up your actual API. After Apiary.io we start to get to the service providers who can deliver on my vision of APIs for the masses: It seems like we are getting closer, albeit its not as easy as I think it should be.

			<p><em>28 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>I spent time this week looking at 20, of what I&rsquo;m calling API reciprocity providers, who are providing a new generation of what is historically known as ETL in the enterprise, to connect, transfer, transform and push data and content between the cloud services we are increasingly growing dependent on. With more and more of our lives existing in the cloud and via mobile devices, the need to migrate data and content between services will only grow more urgent. While ETL has all the necessary tools to accomplish the job, the cloud democratized IT resources, and the same will occur to ETL, making these tools accessible by the masses. There are quite a few ETL solutions, but I feel there are 3 solutions that are starting to make a migration towards an easier to understand and implement vision of ETL: &nbsp; These providers are more robust, and provide much of the classic ETL tools the enterprise is used to, but also have the new emphasis on API driven services. But there are 10 new service providers I&rsquo;m calling reciprocity platforms, that demonstrate the potential with offering very simple tasks, triggers and actions that can provide interaction between two or more API services: I consider reciprocity an evolution of ETL, because of three significant approaches: Simplicity - Simple, meaningful connections with transfer and tranformations that are meaningful to end users, not just a wide array of ETL building blocks an IT architect has to implement API - Reciprocity platforms expose meaningful connections users have the cloud services they depend on. While you can still migrate from databases or file locations as with classic ETL, reciprocity platforms focus on APIs, while maintaining the value for end-users as well as the originating or target platforms Value - Reciprocity focus on not just transmitting data and content, but identifying the value of the payload itself and the relationships, and emotions in play between users and the platforms they depend...[<a href="/2013/02/28/from-etl-to-api-reciprocity-looking-at-20-service-providers/">Read More</a>]</p>

Making onboarding with an API as frictionless as possible is one thing I like to study and educate my readers about. While I was studying what I call the API reciprocity space currently, which is an evolution of what is known in the enterprise as ETL, I came across a company called FoxWeave.
FoxWeave is a service that can migrate and synchronize data across all your cloud and on-premise apps and databases.  When I went to &ldquo;try it now&rdquo; at FoxWeave, I was told &ldquo;no signup needed&rdquo;.  But I didnt&rsquo; think much about it until I saw the temporary guest account popup.

What a powerful concept.  Evolving the freemium concept into the world of anonymity, allowing me to play with and understand your service before having to commit in any way.  One less piece of friction when I&rsquo;m trying to understad a new tool or service.
Nice work FoxWeave.  Way to make interoperability and automation using APIs as frictionless as possible.

			<p><em>27 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>There is a great post by Lorinda Brandon (@lindybrandon) of SmartBear on ProgrammableWeb today called&nbsp;Governance vs Innovation: Do They Have to be Enemies?. &nbsp;She continues a conversation, from API Strategy &amp; Practice around the word "governance", and how in the API space, this is often considered a bad word. &nbsp; I was moderating the questions for Alistair Farquharson (@afarqu)&nbsp;CTO of&nbsp;SOA Software, when&nbsp;Irakli Nadareishvili (@inadarei) of&nbsp;NPR actually agreed that it is a bad word and asked if we need to evolve beyond it and not embrace it. &nbsp;I totally agree with Lorinda's approach to walking the line between governance and innovation, and look forward to more discussion around how to analyze API vs SOA principles within the enterprise--striking a balance that works for each individual approach. To help stimulate this conversation I wanted to break down the word, governance. &nbsp;In the context of IT, governance is: a concept used for activities related to exercising control over services in a service-oriented architecture (SOA). The definitions of SOA governance agree in its purpose of exercising control, but differ in the responsibilities it should have. Some narrow definitions focus on imposing policies and monitoring services, while other definitions use a broader business-oriented perspective With general definitions being: the persons who make up a body for the purpose of administering something the act of governing; exercising authority I think the illness around the word, when it is applied to APIs becomes clear when you start looking at the synonyms: Governance - administration, authority, bureaucracy, command, control, direction, domination, dominion, empire, execution, executive, guidance, influence, jurisdiction, law, ministry, patronage, political practice, politics, polity, power, powers-that-be, predominanc Management - administration, care, charge, command, conduct, control, direction, governance , government, guidance, handling, intendance, manipulation, operation, oversight, rule, superintendence, superintendency, supervision Regulation - adjustment, administration, arrangement, classification, codification, control, coordination, direction, governance , governing, government, guidance, handling, management, moderation, modulation, reconciliation, regimentation, reorganization, settlement, standardization, superintendence, supervision, systematization, tuning Let's separate the potentially bad...[<a href="/2013/02/27/what-is-a-better-word-for-governance-when-it-comes-to-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>While I&rsquo;m wading through dictionaries and thesauruses in an effort to find a more appropriate term &ldquo;governance&rdquo;, when looking at SOA governance through the API lense--I figured I&rsquo;d flush out another area I&rsquo;m working to define a term that appropriately describes automation and interoperability using APIs. Yesterday I took a look at 31 backend as a service (BaaS) providers, in hopes of understanding more about what value they provide. Today I'm diving into the automation section of my new API trends area. While reviewing, I noticed the exact same companies that were under automation were also in interoperability. So I set out to find a new word to apply to this next generation of ETL providers that are building bridges between cloud platforms using APIs, as well as legacy data connections. I have settled on the word reciprocity. The dictionary defines reciprocity as: the quality or state of being reciprocal : mutual dependence, action, or influence a mutual exchange of privileges; specifically : a recognition by one of two countries or institutions of the validity of licenses or privileges granted by the other When you look in the thesaurus, reciprocity has a definition of "interchange" with synonyms of cooperation, exchange, mutuality and reciprocation. Reciprocity is also a synonym of connection with a definition of &ldquo;person who aids another in achieving goal&rdquo;. With synonyms being acquaintance, agent, ally, associate, association, contact, friend, go-between, intermediary, kin, kindred, kinship, mentor, messenger, network, reciprocity, relation, relative and sponsor. &nbsp;(i love that "kin" is a synonym too) All of these terms apply to what I&rsquo;m seeing unfold with this new generation of ETL providers. ETL is moving into the clouds, and out from behind the firewall, using the open web, cloud platforms and APIs, and now we have to rethink ETL, and make it accessible to the masses. Put it within reach of the everday problem owners. What I really like about reciprocity is it describes the mutual relationship between...[<a href="/2013/02/27/merging-api-automation-and-interoperability-into-api-reciprocity/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>26 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>We closed up the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference&nbsp;(#APIstrat) last friday with a panel called APIs, Platforms and Ecosystem, where I moderated a healthy discussion with Tyler Stalder (@tylerstalder)&nbsp;of&nbsp;Singly,&nbsp;Seth Blank (@AntiFreeze) of&nbsp;YourTrove,&nbsp;Asif Rahman (@asifrahman) of&nbsp;Newscred, Orian Marx (@orian) of&nbsp;App.net,&nbsp;Travis Wallis (@traviswallis) of&nbsp;PeopleBrowsr&nbsp;around the very broad spectrum of APIs, platforms and the concept of ecosystems. One of the questions I asked the group was, which of the three OAuth Legs is the most important? &nbsp; To provide a quick primer for the portion of my audience that aren&rsquo;t OAuth geeks: OAuth is an open standard for authorization that provides a method for clients to access server resources on behalf of a resource owner Ok, what does that mean? Think Twitter. Twitter is server. You are the owner of your tweet resources. When you authenticate anywhere using your Twitter ID, that website or app uses OAuth to get access to your tweets, via the Twitter platform. If you login to your Twitter account, click on settings and select apps from the left menu--these are apps and sites that have requested OAuth access your Twitter resources. OAuth is a relationship between you, your platform provider and various sites and apps that want to access your data via the API. Sometimes these apps and your platform provider are one and the same, but the beauty of OAuth&nbsp;is that anyone can request access from you--access that you can revoke when you choose. Back to the panel at API Strategy &amp; Practice. Every panelist, except for Asif Rahman of Newscred said that the most important leg of oAuth is the end user. This made me happy because it shows that, at least at #APIstrat, people are concerned with the interest of the end user. This is healthy. In reality, I worry that when platform discussions do occur, the conversation leans too much in favor of platform, then the developer, with very little to no involvement of the end user.

			<p><em>26 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer in the power of the freemium model when it comes to APIs. Nothing is as it seems when you are deploying managing or consuming APIs. You have to have room to innovate and iterate without signing contracts or paying too much, before you find exactly the right integration or deployment that works. This freemium approach to APIs is one of the biggest reasons I&rsquo;ve been supporting 3Scale since early days of API Evangelist. 3Scale was the original API service provider to offer a truly freemium tier for anyone wanting to deploy an API, and remains passionate about this to this day. During the API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in NYC last week, I had the pleasure of meeting the SmartBear team, who share a similar perspective of the space, resulting in them launching a new suite of free tools that will help you develop, test and monitor while building API driven software. SmartBear has published four new free tools for testing and development: SoapUI is a free and open source cross-platform Functional Testing solution. With an easy-to-use graphical interface, SoapUI allows you to easily and rapidly create and execute automated functional, regression, compliance, and load tests. LoadUI is a free, open source, Web Services load testing solution. With a visual, drag-and-drop interface, it allows you to create, configure and redistribute your load tests interactively and in real-time. LoadUI supports all the standard protocols and technologies. D&eacute;j&agrave;Click is an easy-to-use and powerful addition to your web browser for web macro recording that turns multi-step web interactions into one-click super-bookmarks. Markup and annotate web pages, run web performance tests, and share recordings. Leverage those scripts with AlertSite to measure, diagnose, notify and report on web performance and user experience from an end-user perspective.

			<p><em>26 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Backend as a Service (BaaS) provider QuickBlox announced new pricing plans, which includes a free tier up to 10GB in traffic and storage, with unlimited API calls and push notifications.
The BaaS space is heating up with lots of discussion about whether you should charge developers by active user, features, storage or API call--with each provider being pretty vocal about where they stand.  Quickblox is approach similar to StackMob, who refuses to charge based upon API call, atributing it to a sucess tax. But Quickblox is somewhat different, as they still charge for hard costs like bandwidth and storage--Stackmob only charges by feature.
I'm trying to understand all the approaches to BaaS pricing, which was also a panel discussion last week at API Strategy &amp; Practice between Parse, Stackmob, Kinvey, Kii, Cloudmine and Firebase.  I don't think there is a one size fits all strategy here, but I predict the conversation around BaaS pricing will continue to heat up in 2013 as the market continues to define itself.

			<p><em>26 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>After reading about Google&rsquo;s release of their transparency report last month, I decided I would be addding API transparency reports to my list of essential building blocks for API owners. Since I wrote that, I&rsquo;ve had a great post from EFF also stating that its time for transparency reports to become the new normal. &nbsp;Where the EFF outlines the illness in our current approach: When you use the Internet, you entrust your thoughts, experiences, photos, and location data to intermediaries &mdash; companies like AT&amp;T, Google, and Facebook. But when the government requests that data, users are usually left in the dark. In the United States, companies are not required by law to alert their users when they receive a government request for their data, and in some circumstances, they are explicitly prohibited from doing so. So it is up to us, the users to join organizations like the EFF and let all online service providers understand the importance of transparency reports becoming default operating procedure. Currently, we are only seeing transparency reports from providers like Google, DropBox, LinkedIn, Twitter and a handful of other service providers. While I feel that all companies that run on users data should provide transparency reports, I&rsquo;m going to focus on making sure it is standard operating procedures with companies that deliver APIs. As a starting point for my API transparency report building block, I&rsquo;m using the letter that was drafted by concerned privacy advocates who are calling for Microsoft to issue a transparency report on Skype, which it purchased in 2011 for $8.5 billion. This letter states that: Skype is a voice, video and chat communications platform with over 600 million users worldwide, effectively making it one of the world&rsquo;s largest telecommunications companies. Many of its users rely on Skype for secure communications&mdash;whether they are activists operating in countries governed by authoritarian regimes, journalists communicating with sensitive sources, or users who wish to talk privately in confidence with business...[<a href="/2013/02/26/api-transparency-report-as-essential-building-block/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m currently tracking on 31 backend as a service providers, in an effort to better understand how this new breed of platforms are helping developers build web and mobile apps. After looking at all the BaaS providers, there are 13 clear leaders: Then there are another 18 other players, trying to play catch up in a space that is working hard to define itself in 2013: My goal is to better understand what features are offered across these 31 BaaS providers. To accomplish this, I spent no more than an hour per provider looking through their sites and playing with their products to get at least a basic understanding of their offerings. When looking for features I tried to standardize the best I could, but it is difficult when there are different approaches to the deployment of resources on each platform. I found about 75 distinct features being offered across the 31 BaaS providers. I&rsquo;m sure there are other features, and vital details missing, but I wanted to start somewhere.

			<p>One of the lively discussions at the API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in NYC last week was the backend as a service (BaaS) panel I moderated towards the end of the first day. We brought together Ilya Sukhar (@ilyasu) of&nbsp;Parse, Morgan Bickle (@morganbickle) of&nbsp;Kinvey, Marc Weil (@marcweil) of&nbsp;Cloudmine, Miko Matasumura (@mikojava) of&nbsp;Kii, Ty Amell (@tyamell) of&nbsp;StackMob&nbsp;James Tamplin (@jamestamplin) of&nbsp;Firebase to talk about the fast growing BaaS space. I kicked things off with some pretty standard stuff, by having each person introduce themselves and explain what they do. Next I asked them to explain what differentiates themselves from the other folks on the couch. After that, things started heating up when I brought up a discussion about BaaS pricing, from an earlier online discussion about the mertits of user, feature or pricing base upon number of API calls. The common approach is user or api based pricing, with Stackmob focused on feature based BaaS pricing. BaaS panel is actually really really interesting. Great line up. #apistrat &mdash; Ilya Bagrak (@ibagrak) February 21, 2013 The conversation was definitely lead by Ty Amell of StackMob, with pointed rebuttals from Ilya Sukhar of Parse, with Miko Matasumura of Kii in between, being very diplomatic while also throwing some jabs of his own. Morgan Bickle of Kinvey, Marc Weil of Cloudmine and James Tamplin of Firebase held their own, but it things were definitely overshadowed by the discussion by Ty and Ilya. Super interesting trust issue: &ldquo;[What happens if your BaaS gets acquired and pulls a Posterous?]&rdquo; #apistrat &mdash; r. kevin nelson (@rknLA) February 21, 2013 Next the panel moved the discussion to the future of Baas, with direct questions about what potential exit strategies are for each of the platforms.

I see a lot of dead simple, yet meaningful uses of APIs come across my desk (I don&rsquo;t have a desk, why do I keep saying this?) each day.  One I saw today is something every school, whether K-12, college or university should have.
Using the UC Berkeley API, you can get a list of all departments:
_curl -v -X GET "https://apis-dev.berkeley.edu/cxf/asws/department?departmentCode=a&amp;app_id=309fe68e&amp;app_key=51b9d67dc4f0501eed763822a641b17b"_
Then with the proper department code you can pull a list of classes:
_curl -v -X GET "https://apis-dev.berkeley.edu/cxf/asws/classoffering?departmentCode=ARCH&amp;app_id=your-id&amp;app_key=your-key"_
With the proper keys, anyone can easily pull relevant UC Berkeley department and class data to use in website or app, or even populate a Google Spreadsheet for other purposes.

The UC Berkeley API Management Portal is brand new, I&rsquo;m still working on separate story regarding their approach, but I wanted to talk about how good it is to see such straightforward, valuable uses of an API at a leading university.
This simple example is something you should be able to do by default at all schools across the country.
The best part is that the API team is actively communicating these uses of the API on Google+, which is how I came across the story.

The conference went off without a hitch, and was exactly the conference I envisioned when 3Scale first contacted me seven months ago about the idea of putting on the event. &nbsp;In July of 2012 Steve Willmott the CEO and founder of 3Scale sent me an email stating: ..we're thinking of finally getting round to organizing an API focused event (conference) which tries to help spread knowledge about API, promote good practice and broaden the API tent beyond what it is today. The aim would be an event which combined both "business and practice" - meaning one element which tackles critical topics such as business models, strategy, success stories etc. and another which is about "what can be done with APIs" and "how to make it happen technically". Closing with: The final important thing is we'd like it to be a very open event - with a range of supporters, speakers and attendees and - while vendors might sponsor - it wouldn't be a "vendor" event. To which I responded with: Sounds like a great idea to me. I'm in, and willing to help in any way I can. Of course I would be in. I&rsquo;ve wanted this type of conference to occur for a while now, and what better way to make sure it happens right, than doing it yourself! It was an amazing opportunity for me--there was no ignoring it. As many of you know the original conference was scheduled for November 1st and 2nd in New York, City. But due to hurricane Sandy, we had to postpone the conference and we ended up rescheduling it for last Thursday and Friday, February 21st and 22nd at the same venue--the Westin Grand Central in NYC. In the end, the conference ended up with about 350 registered (SOLD OUT),with about what appears to be about 275-325 floating around each day, coming and going listening to...[<a href="/2013/02/25/exactly-the-api-strategy-amp-practice-conference-i-envisioned/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
Salesforce has a pretty cool Code Share&nbsp;area within the DeveloperForce ecosystem, which allows developers to share code snippets with the rest of the community.
Its a pretty cool way for anyone to share their techniques as code samples in a variety of languages, then letting the community vet the code, fork larger projects, and collaborate to improve the code for the greater good.
Acknowledging that they don't have the internal resources to fully support the process, Salesforce has halted code samples submission, announcing plans to migrate the Code Sharing program to Github.
Github is already the largest code sharing platform, providing social tools that developers are used to.  Salesforce's publiclackowledgement that they don't have the internal resources to operate, the fact they identify the importance of such a program, and the decision to migrate to Github are all very savvy moves by the API pioneer.
Github is one of the most important platforms you can use to support your API.  Using Github to host all your API code samples and SDKs, whether they are generated internally or by your developers community is becoming more than a novelty, but an essential part of API operations.

Google is using the online learning platform Udacity to teach developers about game development.

The HTML Game Development course from Google is an interesting approach to developer education by providing an online course bundled with in-person or streamed workshops and study groups, bundled with a contest to help motivate students.
I may create a blueprint for other API providers to follow, when launching their own courses in a similar way to Google.

The AWS e-commerce architecture reference provides three separate areas:

Web Frontend - This is a reference architecture for the web frontend of an e-commerce site. It makes use of Route 53, CloudFront, Elastic Beanstalk, S3, ElastiCache, DynamoDB and CloudSearch
Checkout Pipeline - This is a reference architecture for a secure and highly available checkout pipeline service for an e-commerce site. It uses the Virtual Private Cloud, the Simple Workflow Service, Elastic Beanstalk, the Relational Database Service, and the Simple Email Service
Marketing &amp; Recommendations Service - This is a reference architecture for a marketing and recommendation service for an e-commerce site. It uses Elastic MapReduce, S3, Elastic Beanstalk, the Relational Database Service, DynamoDB, and the Simple Email Service

Beyond providing the detailed reference card, AWS provides more information on a three-day course in AWS Architecture Training that will be held in numerous U.S. cities this spring.
I will add API architecture references as a building block for API owners to consider when planning and managing an API.  If you can provide clear blueprints for developers to follow, you can increase the chances developers will be successful with integration of an API into their application or systems.

The API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference is happening next week in NYC. I have had so much fun pulling together the schedule of keynotes, panels, sessions and the talks on the 429 - Too Many Requests stage. &nbsp;
The number of requests we've received for sponsoring, speaking and attending has been overhelming. &nbsp;Resulting in a sold out conference, and an amazing lineup of speakers. &nbsp;I was spending some time tidying up the speakers page and sponsor page today, and was so impressed with the companies involved, I had to share.
There are 72 companies represented at API Strategy &amp; Practice:




























































































































































































































I don't know about you, but I'm pretty blown away by the list of companies that will be attendance. &nbsp;I'm stoked we were able to pull together such an awesome lineup. &nbsp;I wish I could publish a list of companies who are attending, because that list would equally blow your mind. &nbsp;
It's exciting to see the buzz around APIs in 2013, and I look forward to seeing you at API Strategy &amp; Practice.

Palo Alto has opened up city data, including operational data about the Palo Alto City Library.  Using the Palo Alto City open data portal you can access machine-readable data sets about various aspects of library operations including visitor count, checkouts by type of materia, information and circulation services, programs attendance, website visitors count and how library funds are spent.
The Palo Alto open data portal provides widgets with data grids and charts derived from data.  But you can also&nbsp;request data sets and access data via the City of Palo Alto's API.
The city hopes that it will increase community engagement by making data open and machine readable by default. The city is looking to throw hackathons that will develop solutions, and increase public engagement in city government, and ultimately save money and enhance city services.
The City of Palo Alto open data portal is provided by cloud-based Junar Open Data Platform.

			<p>The Backend as a Service (BaaS) space is picking up momentum in 2013. I&rsquo;m tracking on 20 BaaS providers, in hopes of better understanding what is being offered in this space. Today I came across an interesting new, open source BaaS platform, being developed in the European Union called OPENi. The project describes itself as: OPENi is a European Union ICT Framework Programme (FP7) Information and communications technology (ICT) Collaborative project. Over the 30 month project duration we aim to deliver an open-source, cloud based platform for integrating mobile services. With a mission to: Our mission is to inspire innovation in the European mobile applications industry, by radically improving the interoperability of cloud-based services and trust in personal cloud storage through the development of a consumer-centric, open source mobile cloud applications platform. With the following objective: OPENi&rsquo;s objective is to directly address the lack of interoperability between cloud based services and enable applications to access and use a broad spectrum of existing cloud based functionality and content, consistently across different devices and platforms, in a way that enables a user-centric application experience. Targeting the needs of Application Developers, Services Providers and Consumers, OPENi will realize its vision for user-centric, cloud-connected, mobile applications. OPENi is a 30 month project, we will have to wait and see what comes out of the iniative. With the EU approach to open data and data privacy, I think there is a lot of potential to deploy and consume APIs, as well as delivering API automation, interoperability and backend platforms that have a healthy, consumer-centric approach--which I believe will be good for business, because its good for ender users. In early 2013 the OPENi team will release software for the BaaS platform as an open-source project on github.com. When released I will evaluate it side by side with the other BaaS providers I&rdquo;m tracking on.

Facebook launched a new video channel last week, dedicated to keeping developers up to date on the latest news, tutorials, speaking sessions from the Facebook developer ecosystem.
Facebook is going to provide content for web and mobile developers, with attention in other specialty areas like gaming and information for publishers.
The first edition of the channel will be recorded live on February 19th, with Director of Product Doug Purdy, with the top 3 things every mobile developer needs to know.
I'm adding a video channel to my list of API building blocks.  I don't think you have to be a Facebook before you have your own channel.  Using Google Hangouts + Youtube is an easy way for any API owner to start their own video channel to support developers.

			<p><em>10 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time lately thinking about emerging trends in API usage. One area I&rsquo;m tracking on, is around companies that are offering simple services that provide interoperability and automation between cloud platforms, using APIs. The best known examples are from companies like If This Then That (IFTTT) and Zapier, who provide end users with simple icon based tools for defining tasks that move data between SaaS platforms. Its tough to define this space, which in enterprise speak is really just Extract Transform Load (ETL), which is historically a process to migrate information between systems in an enterprise, using data sources and web services. But with the popularity of web APIs, we need to rethink ETL in the context of the cloud and update how we approach interoperability between the growing number of API driven platforms. Mike Reich of Seabourne, and I were discussing this last time I was in Washington D.C., and he currently has a great blog post on rethinking ETL for the API age. If you don&rsquo;t know Seabourne, they are behind high profile government projects like MyFCC and GovInfo. They have been doing a lot of thinking about how to acquire, process and publish content with APIs. To better help me&nbsp;better understand the space, I&rsquo;m watching 12 service providers that I&rsquo;m putting in a bucket of what I consider the next generation of ETL providers: Cloudwork - Cloudwork is a service that allows users to automate tasks between Google Apps, Salesforce, Evernote, Zoho, Twitter, Freshbooks, MailChimp, Zendesk, Dropbox, WordPress and others. &nbsp; &nbsp; Elastic.io - elastic.io helps you to automate routine operations and connect multiple cloud APIs. &nbsp; &nbsp; Foxweave - FoxWeave is a Cloud-Based Data Integration Platform that lets you easily migrate and synchronize data across all your Cloud and On-Premise applications and databases, without having to write any code. &nbsp; &nbsp; If This Then That (IFTTT) - IFTTT is a service that enables customers to connect channels...[<a href="/2013/02/10/bringing-etl-to-the-masses-with-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve been processing a conversation over at Branch, that was triggered by a story in TechCrunch by Sarah Perez(@sarahintampa) called, &ldquo;StackMob Ratchets Up The Competition: Makes API Calls Free, Launches A Marketplace For Third-Party Mobile Services&rdquo;. There are several layers to the convSteersation, the part I&rsquo;m focusing on is about how BaaS providers are structuring their pricing, in which Sarah Perez writes: StackMob is now making API calls free. This latter news will impact the competitive landscape, which includes startups like Parse, Kinvey and others, all of which have traditionally charged developers as API calls increase alongside an app&rsquo;s popularity. Making the argument that: Today, developers have to have an understanding of how many API calls they make, and if an app becomes really successful, developers are penalized for that with increased pricing. Sarah quotes StackMob CEO Ty Amell, saying that: &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t really all that fair, explaining that it doesn&rsquo;t matter to StackMob how many API calls the app makes &ndash; the cost to them doesn&rsquo;t really go up. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter to us whether someone&rsquo;s making a million API calls or 20 million API calls &ndash; the cost is fairly manageable on our parts. So we felt like this was a blocker to innovation on the developer&rsquo;s side,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;And we feel like API calls are starting to become a commodity, where it&rsquo;s really how can you provide value beyond that?&rdquo; The conversation immediately begins on Twitter, with: Steve Gershnik(@StackMobSteve) of Stackmob - @stackmob doesn't charge for 'active users' either. No success tax for you. Joe Chernov (@jchernov) of Kinvey - but you charge for features. In the end, everyone charges for something. It's business! After this, the conversation moves to Branch. I&rsquo;m not including full comments, because there is a lot of banter back and forth, discussing various claims BaaS providers make, that I feel are irrelevant to the more important, pricing story.

			<p><em>05 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>
There is an interesting post on the Parse blog about instaDM, which is a service built using Parse, the BaaS platform, that provides private messaging in the Instagram ecosystem.
This is a very interesting approach to externally developing features for another platform or service.  I think Parse says it well:
Even the hottest new apps, however, aren&rsquo;t perfect and that&rsquo;s where clever innovators can fill in the gaps with a great idea. Parse-powered instaDM is one such innovation.
On one hand, this approach is a gamble.  All Instagram has to do is copy what you've done, put it in the roadmap, and your done. &nbsp;Finished.
On the other hand, I think this is a very realistic way of pushing a platform forward, by external developers, using APIs.  If an API provider is smart, when you have someone in your ecosystem roll out a valuable feature like this, you invest in their success.
Building features that augment web or mobile apps like this demonstrate that API ecosystems offer a lot potential for innovation, and I have to say it is even more interesting that this is being built on Parse--probably a whole other story in itself.
I don&rsquo;t think every idea that comes out of Silicon Valley should be VC size. APIs allow more lots of smaller, more sustainable features to emerge, that don't need large scale investment. instaDM is an example of this potential.

			<p>
Salesforce talked a little bit about its strategy around the development and release strategy around the Salesforce Eclipse plug-in. &nbsp;Providing a little transparency into how they stagger its API releases as well as waiting to release their Eclipse plug-in, until API release is complete.
I&rsquo;m more interested in this story from an API building block perspective.  An eclipse plug-in seems like a building block for only the most mature APIs out there, and especially ones targeting the enterprise.  An eclipse plug-in is not for every API, but I think I will add it as a building block to consider.
It also seems like something a 3rd party provider could step up and find success with as well, by building a single or suite of Eclipse plug-ins that provide integrated API developer tools across popular or high value web APIs for Eclipse users.
I believe IDE plug-ins for APIs will be one way we can provide API discovery solutions for developers, by bringing valuable, qualified API resources into their development environments.

			<p>
Google is adjusting their pricing model for the Adwords API, acknowledging that having a free usage tier is important. &nbsp;Making the API easier to access, while also ensuring a certain QOS.
Google has opted to go with two levels of API access:

Basic - Basic access is provided by default and allows up to 10,000 operations per day
Standard - Standard access is available to qualified developers and has no daily limit on operations

With both basic or standard access, there are no charges for AdWords API usage.  Google is just looking to maintain quality over which developers can hammer on the API, while acknowledging a free tier allows for experimentation and innovation. &nbsp;All you have to do is apply to be part of the standard level, if you reach limits of basic tier.
This is a good model for even a totally open data of free resource APIs.  While you want your data and resources to be open, you also want to be able to offer a certain quality of service, and keep infrastructure costs to a minimum.
To do this, you will need to to secure the API interface to some degree.

			<p>I did a presentation at the DC API Meetup, when I was in Washington DC last week. My talk was some of my usual material around the history, business and politics of APIs, but included a section on trends, where I covered some of the newer aggregation providers like Singly, BaaS providers like Parse and automation tools like IFTTT. At the end of the meetup, we did a QA panel session, and Javaun Moradi (@javaun), product manager at NPR digital, made a great point about the reliability and stability of this new generation of third party platforms building aggregate, backend, automation or other types of providers who are in turn, dependent on other API providers. Javaun questioned the reliability of this new generation of startups, who are newly funded, most likely not yet profitable, dependent on other APIs, and are most likely going to be acquired later on down the road, or go out of business when funding runs out. Javaun felt that established players like Salesforce and Google are here to stay, you know they aren&rsquo;t going anywhere--where a new startup has greater potential for service disruption and instability. If you are building your app, and depending on an aggregate API service like Singly, or backend as a service (BaaS) platform like Cloudmine or reliant on a automation platform like Zapier, you want to know the company is going to be around in a year. Right? In my opinion, the number one way these new breed of startups can alleviate these concerns, is by solving developer problems, delivering value (which every company I&rsquo;ve mentioned is doing) and have a clear business model. Success is the best solution, right? Another way these startups can instill confidence in the developers who are building apps around around their services is to also offer open source options.

			<p><em>03 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>For the longest time I would get asked, "Which API service provider should I use to deploy my APIs?". This was a tough question, because historically the API management providers don't help you deploy your APIs, they only help you manage them. Deploying your APIs was up to you. Generally you already had some sort of internal system that you would use to generate RESTful interfaces or you'd go find your own open source API framework and deploy. Then you'd proxy or connect your API to one of the API service providers. These lines are now blurred by providers like Intel with their enterprise API gateway, and through API deployment resources from 3Scale. 3Scale is investing in open source server technology for NGINX, and blueprints for API deployment using Amazon Web Services. 3Scale recently published a quickstart tutorial on how to deploy an API on Amazon EC2 for Amazon Web Services (AWS), and manage it using 3Scale API management. My favorite part is that everything in this tutorial is completely FREE. A critical element to experimenting with APIs. The 3Scale, AWS walk-though provides details for: Creating and configuring EC2 Instance Preparing Instance for Deployment Deploying a demo API solution Enabling API Management with 3Scale Implementing an Nginx Proxy for Access Control There are several important things going on here, beyond being able to do this for free with an entry level AWS and 3Scale accounts. But I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough, the value of this being free and allowing you to explore, experiment and iterate with your API--without spending a fortune! This is critical to not just your API initiative, but contributes to a more healthy API space in general. After being free, you are using proven open source technology like Ubuntu for server OS and NGINX for your web server. 3Scale has invested in tools for NGINX, rather than building their own proprietary solutions, because NGINX has been proven to deliver at scale and has...[<a href="/2013/02/03/deploy-and-manage-api-on-amazon-web-services-aws/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I was listening to Did You Hear That? I Think It Was The Sound Of A Walrus, on NPR this morning.  It is about the Macaulay Library, which is:
...the world's largest and oldest scientific archive of biodiversity audio and video recordings. Our mission is to collect and preserve recordings of each species' behavior and natural history, to facilitate the ability of others to collect and preserve such recordings, and to actively promote the use of these recordings for diverse purposes spanning scientific research, education, conservation, and the arts.
The library's collection has a total of more than 7,000 hours of sounds, the result of an 80-year collaboration between the scientific community and the library's volunteer collaborators.  An amazing resource!
I couldn't help myself, and emailed them, to let them know a web API of the audio and video collection would be a great addition.  If developers could build web and mobile apps around the sounds, it would extend the reach of the catalog exponentially.
Of course you'd do it in a way that adds value to the collection and protects it as a brand and priceless asset.
The digitizing of the Macaulay Library, making it available online is a great example of the potential of open content, data and APIs.  Our world is full of rich resources like this, we just need to digitize and make accessible in sensible ways that make them available to the widest audience possible.

			<p>When I talk about API discovery, in-person at events, or on my blog(s), I notice people automatically default to thinking I mean a universal API discovery language that will work for all web APIs. I think the technologists that operate in the API space are always striving for technical perfection--resulting in the discussions that you see around REST, HATEOAS, OAuth and similarly for this one about API discovery. I&rsquo;m thankful for the passion and dedication of the technologists in this space, but when it comes to API discovery, I&rsquo;m never talking about a universal language or approach. I personally just don&rsquo;t believe there can be one definition to rule them all. When I reference API discovery, I&rsquo;m focusing on API discovery at the provider level, and providing information and resources that allow people who launch APIs to be successful. I have no interest in defining or support a world-wide or industry level definition for API discovery. I leave these conversations to all y'all tech pundits. I am a fan of supporting API providers to do something, anything! Sure, it should be a standardized as you feel necessary. I hope you use something that is already in existence like WADL, Swagger or I/O Docs (don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel), and make sure and look at the approach Google is taking with their API discovery service--as they have some experience in the field. In reality though, your motivation to develop JSON or XML definitions for your API will probably be to provide interactive documentation or allow for easy generation of code libraries for your API--not discovery. With the API discovery conversation automatically defaulting to a universal definition by the tech pundits, API providers will often avoid these discussions, leaving it a lower priority when planning and implementing an API. Much like with HATEOAS, without concrete examples of value, API providers won&rsquo;t see value in providing JSON or XML definitions of their APIs.

I'm always working to find a way to organize my world, to help me better keep track of my wealth of content and information, while also assisting people in navigating my sometimes chaotic world of sites, blogs and projects.
To help organize this, I'm breaking my navigation on KinLane.com into two main groups. &nbsp;The first area is overview information about my world in the following sections:

Blog&nbsp;- My personal thoughts and random observations in blog form
About&nbsp;- My official bio that I use across most of my profile, which changes each year
Research&nbsp;- Any areas I'm currently researching or looking to research in the near future
Projects&nbsp;- Projects that I've completed and made publicly available (hopefully on Github)
Talks&nbsp;- Some video and slideshows from talks that I've given
Images&nbsp;- A variety of logos, photos and drawings from across my world as API Evangelist
Mission&nbsp;- The mission statement for my evangelism platform
Contact&nbsp;- Various ways you can get a hold of me

The second area is providing links to all my main properties:

API Evangelist&nbsp;- Business of APIs
API Voice&nbsp;- Politics of APIs
API Stack&nbsp;- My ranking system for the API space
Hack Weekends&nbsp;- A resource site focused on hackathons
IPA Evangelist&nbsp;- My personal blogging about my love of IPAs
Hacker Storytelling&nbsp;- A format I'm using in 2013 to make my projects open and machine readable by default

When you google my name, KinLane.com comes up first. &nbsp;So I want to make sure and provide one click access to everything I have going on. &nbsp;
I will adjust this from time to time, and work to keep each of these sections up to date as things shift.

			<p><em>02 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Master API architect at Layer7 Technologies Mike Amundsen (@mamund) has a great post this week on Four Tech-Related Trends That Will Shape 2013.
One of the predictions that caught my eye was that "individual service deployments on the Web will get smaller and more numerous"--he clarifies it with:
Influenced by the existence of the many mobile apps running on a single device, Web-based services will become small, single-focused offerings that (in the words of Doug Mcllroy) &ldquo;do one thing and do it well.&rdquo; This will also explode the number of available services. The advantage of this trend will be an increase in the agility and evolvability of service offerings. The challenge will be an increased need for governance at the &ldquo;micro-service&rdquo; level.
I have to agree.  I think the smaller we can break resources down, the better.  Agility is key in the API economy.  But as Mike points out it won't come without its new set of problems, like life cycle, governance and discovery.
Much like web pages, I think we'll still try to estimate the number APIs available, but there will be so many, we will lose track in the near future.  But we'll find an organic approach to designing, deploying, managing, discovering and consuming web APIs that strikes a balance.

Master API architect at Layer7 Technologies Mike Amundsen (@mamund) has a great post this week on Four Tech-Related Trends That Will Shape 2013.
One of the predictions that caught my eye was that "server mash-ups will increase but client mash-ups will decline"--he clarifies it with:
The increasing popularity of languages like Node.js, Erlang and Closure will make implementing server-side mash-ups more efficient and easier to maintain than doing the same work within a client application; especially for the mobile platform. This will reduce the &ldquo;chattiness&rdquo; of client-side applications and increase the security and flexibility of server-side implementations. The result will be a perceived increase in responsiveness and a reduced use of battery power on mobile apps.
As with my earlier post, individual API deployments will get smaller and more numerous, I agree 100%.  This is where I&rsquo;m going with my post this week on virtual API stacks.  With so many individual resources available on the web, in the coming years we&rsquo;ll see increased &ldquo;mashing up&rdquo; or &ldquo;virtualization&rdquo; of new stacks, that are meaningful to a particular app or group of developers.
An example of this in the wild is&nbsp;Singly, with their API aggregation or mashup, which is available as a service, but is also available as open source on Github as Hallway.  Another recent example is potentially the OpenKit Gaming BaaS, which promised to be an open stack designed for game developers.
My predication is we&rsquo;ll see many more returns from server side API mashups, than we did during the client side mashup gold rush days! &nbsp;Especially if providers open source these stacks, while also offering as a service.

What John Sheehan (@johnsheehan&nbsp;) and Steve Marx (@smarx) are doing on the podcast is SO needed in the API space, I highly recommend subscribing to the podcast in your itunes and listening regularly. I was honored to be critiqued in the podcast this week, where they &ldquo;gently&rdquo; disagreed with my post from earlier this week on my speculation around virtual API stacks. So I wanted to &ldquo;gently&rdquo; respond and help clarify. The first 60 seconds, pretty much sum up rebuttal, where they make my argument for me by saying IFTT and Zapier are already doing this? Which is the whole basis for my story except I use Singly and Temboo as examples. All of these providers are in the same space in my opinion, I think maybe they are just referencing what they are familiar with (as John used to work at IFTTT). Second they read in that I&rsquo;m envisioning some grand discovery language? Not sure where this comes from. I&rsquo;m just referencing that API providers can provide JSON definitions of their APIs, which is happening with specs like Swagger, but not being done for discovery but for interactive documentation and code stub generation--the fact it is there is a plus for discovery. But I have zero visions of there every being a grand &ldquo;standard&rdquo; for discovery, but I feel you can't argue Swagger is picking up momentum. John and Steve also reference that I&rsquo;m calling for a &ldquo;standardized building blocks API providers can jump on?&rdquo; Not sure where this comes from. My arguement is that API will play almost no role in this process at all. They won&rsquo;t give a shit or prepare in any way. It will be 3rd party providers stepping up and building these abstracted platforms around existing API providers.

			<p><em>01 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>I had the pleasure of being on stage with Tim Herzog (@tgherzog), a Open Data Specialist from the World Bank yesterday at the DC API meetup at NPR. During the QA panel, at the end of the meetup, a question came from the audience, stating that open data from government is often boring, and thus is the reason much of what we see built on government isn't that exciting--alluding that there has to be more high value, exciting data that isn't being released. While I agree that much of the data made available from open government initiatives is boring and stale, and there are probably much better datasets available, I also think this is more of a storytelling problem, than a data problem. After the question was asked, I quickly answered by pointing to my left at Tim Herzog, and said the World Bank does an awesome job at this. If you look through the World Bank data catalog, and spend time looking through their blog, you see a symbiotic relationship between their open data, APIs and the stories they tell on the blog. This approach is similar to what I'm calling Hacker Storytelling, the only difference is I am hosting all my stories on Github as individual repositories. If you look at the home page of the World Bank data site today, there is a link to the blog post, "What does data tell us about debt of high income and developing countries?" This is a great example of not just providing a dataset, but actually telling the story around the data, while providing tools that let you interact with the data, making everything a very hands on experience--increasing the chances users will make an emotional connection with the data. According to the blog post, the World Bank maintains two quarterly databases of information on external and public sector debt of many countries.

			<p><em>01 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>
A new player in the Backend as a Service (BaaS) space has emerged, from former OpenFeint co-founder Peter Relan--called OpenKit. &nbsp;The new BaaS platform is targeting game developers, providing cross-platform tools for both iOS and Android. &nbsp;The core features of the gaming BaaS platform are:

Cloud data sync - Save game progress in the cloud with data storage. Sync it across both iOS and Android devices for a consistent gaming experience
Leaderboards - Drop-in leaderboard SDK's for both iOS and Android. Give your users the opportunity to compete against millions of other players
Facebook &amp; Twitter auth - Users login with familiar third party social networks like Facebook and Twitter. No need to create and manage accounts. OpenKit handles it all
Cross-platform support - OpenKit supports both iOS and Android. Our native SDKs are lightweight and will take just a few minutes to integrate into your game

OpenKit represents a trend I&rsquo;m tracking on where people are pulling together specialized or virtualized stacks targeting specific groups of developers.  Early movers in the space like Kinvey, Parse and Cloudmine have generally catered to all types of developers by providing them a backend stack, that assists them in rapidly building mobile and web apps. So naturally the next step is to see more specialized stacks, for smaller groups of developers.
I&rsquo;m stoked to see that OpenKit is completely open source, readily available on Github, as well as comes out of the box with a REST API.  Open source BaaS is something I was identifying was missing from the space.
I will add OpenKit to my trends section for Backend as a Service, where I&rsquo;m tracking on the BaaS space, and will dive in deeper and compare it with some of the other offerings we are seeing emerge.

			<p><em>01 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>I came to Washington DC this week for meetings with a couple federal agencies and a handful of private companies who contract with our government--including a conversation last night at the DC API Meetup Group, which met at NPR offices downtown. The API Meetup started with pizza, a healthy selection of beer and networking with around 50 API professionals and API curious from around the DC area. I was able to meet about 15 folks I know online, but have never had the opportunity to connect with in real life. Ben Balter (@BenBalter), one of the Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) kicked off the conversation with a presentation of some of the cool API discovery, CSV to API, DB to API and various tool he's developed during his time as a innovation fellow. I totally dig Ben's style, in making very small, but powerful open source tools that can make a real difference in how government opens up data via APIs. I was up next, giving a talk titled, "From Web, to Programmable Web, to Programmable World". I wanted to give everyone a healthy dose on the history of APIs, some views on where we are currently, and where API are going with an introduction to concepts like aggregation and automation. The talk is meant to be a 200K foot walkthrough of the API space, which also reflects all of the sections available on APIEvangelist.com. Next up was Gray Brooks from the General Services Administration (GSA) who walked through some of the open data and API initiatives coming out of the federal government. He is overseeing some very important aspects of the White House Digital Strategy, and is the point person for the execution of the digital strategy across all federal agencies. After Gray talked, Tim Herzog (@tgherzog) the Open Data Specialist at the World Bank walked us through what the World Bank is doing with their open data initiatives, which APIs are at the core....[<a href="/2013/02/01/a-conversation-about-apis-in-washington-dc/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>One of the top five concerns I hear from companies considering APIs is regarding losing control of their brand. With APIs being about access to raw data and resources, companies immediately think that developers will extract the value, without any attribution or reference to the companies brand. Even with this being a major concern, I see many APIs implement very poor branding guidelines, giving developers zero direction regarding how to properly provide attribution. &nbsp;This is a missed opportunity to not just protect the API providers brand, but actually extend it and increase its value. With this in mind, I'm always on the lookout for good examples of API branding guidelines. &nbsp;One recent example I came across while monitoring my API Stack, is from the Active Network which provides activity and outdoor content via their APIs. Active Network starts with a great explanation of why they provide branding guidelines: At ACTIVE Network, we want you to be able to create fantastic applications with the ACTIVE Network APIs. At the same time, we don't want users to get confused about who is responsible for the data they are accessing, so we have some brand guidelines. Next Active Network explains to developers why branding guidelines are important to their own users: The ACTIVE brand holds credibility in the mind of the customer. It serves as a seal of approval giving customers the confidence to transact through a trusted source As a consumer utility, ACTIVE.com&reg; captures and records registration activity providing people with a record of their personal registration history if they need it at a future date Transacting for an ACTIVE powered activity, tells your customer who they need to call if they need help.

			<p><em>29 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>
App.net has just released a File API to add to their messaging and communication stack, allowing any App.net account to natively store files via the social platform.
Each App.net account will be given a 10GB file storage area, allowing applications to read and write files, that can be linked and embedded within App.net communications.
This approach reminds me of what I&rsquo;m seeing within the backend as a service (BaaS) space with other common developer resources like user management, object storage and key-value stores.
App.net is just making sure developers have the resources they will need to be successful building web and mobile apps with the App.net API--a similar motivation for BaaS providers as wel as other API providers.
While many developers are fine with using multiple API providers to get what they need, I can see an opportunity to provide the essential resources developers will need within the primary API that they are building their app around.
As essential API resources are further commoditized, it seems like an opportunity for private label BaaS resources to emerge.  File storage could become something that any API provider could offer alongside their own resources, without having to reinvent the wheel each time.
Maybe such services already exist under other names, and I'm unaware of it, but it seems like a great opportunity for cloud providers to step up and offer private label, backend resources for API providers to integrate into their platforms.

			<p><em>28 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>Up until now we tend to think of APIs individually--we approach integration in terms of the Twilio API, Twitter API or the Facebook API. But as the number of public APIs has grown beyond 8K, and an unknown amount of internal and partner APIs become available, we are seeing new patterns of aggregation and interoperability emerge from companies like Singly, but also seeing automation be added into the mix by companies like Temboo, and entire backend stacks from providers like Parse. These new aggregated or backend stacks of API driven resources can be as general as object and key-value stores, user management and other developer commodities we see backend as a service providers (BaaS) bring to the table, or they can be very personal like the photos Singly is aggregating across Flickr, Facebook and Instagram and with friends and followers across Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. As I see these new aggregate and BaaS providers emerge, at an ever increasing pace, I can&rsquo;t help but think--this still isn&rsquo;t fast enough (its my nature, you should try being me). If I want common mobile developer resources I can adopt one of these new BaaS platforms like Kinvey or Parse, or if I need personal and social resources, which have become part of the fabric of web and mobile apps, I can go to Singly. But what if I want a more specialized network, say just for education? I might need user management, object storage, key-value storage, access to commons social tools like friends and photos across multiple social networks, but I also need access to open courseware, teacher and student directories all via a very secure, auditable, efficient stack tailored just for K-12? I will have to wait, for the next wave of startups to emerge. While in NYC on Friday I had a great discussion with Temboo about virtualization.

API ecosystems are all about research &amp; development, and an opportunity for incubating ideas and apps in a way that invites 3rd party developers and companies to develop innovative ways of using your company assets and resources.  I&rsquo;ve discussed incubation within an API ecosystem before,&nbsp;and how companies are not just identifying developer talent and the best apps, but actually investing in companies via their API.
A new example of this in action is Nike's&nbsp;launch of their&nbsp;Nike+ Accelerator--a partnership with TechStars that will host 10 companies for a three-month, immersive, mentor-driven startup accelerator designed to spur development on the&nbsp;NikeFuel, the Nike+ FuelBand, and Nike+ Running API platform.
The 10 partner companies will be given the following:

$20,000
Access to the Nike+ APIs, Nike+ mobile SDKs, and Nike+ FuelBand Dev Kit (Beta) - you will be among the first in the world to receive this access
A Nike+ FuelBand for each team member
Tech support from experienced developers who've built companies, or built with Nike+ Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
Code and solution reviews during the program
Mentor sessions with Nike executives and leaders in the start-up community
Two Investor Demo Days: one at the Nike World Headquarters and one in Silicon Valley
Real Access to Decision Makers


Then, at the end of the Nike+ Accelerator, each team will present to Nike executives, mentors, angel investors, venture capitalists, and tech industry leaders.
As an API publisher have you considered a built-in accelerator or incubation program within your API ecosystem?  And while I&rsquo;m at it, has your incubator or accelerator consider a partnership program tailored for API publishers?
Sounds kind of like a Reese's Peanut Butter commercial! :)

I&rsquo;m big podcast fan, and I"m always looking for something I can listen to in the background while I&rsquo;m coding or writing stories. &nbsp;Traffic and Weather is great for this.
The podcast dives into various topics ranging from Webhooks to oAuth, but keeps things light, where I think even non-technical folks can get up to speed on the latest in the space.  John and Steve make things very informative, while being friendly and keeping it conversational.
I added a widget to my right hand menu, which will always pull the latest episode from Traffic and Weather.  You can also click on the logo to go directly to their site.

			<p>For the last seven years, when you wanted to find an API you went to ProgrammableWeb. It has been the definitive way to discover new APIs, and responsible for all the buzz in the space that has gotten the industry to where it is. Now that ProgrammableWeb is at 8400 APIs in its directory, and adding 50-100 each week, it will continue to get even more difficult to discover APIs. Even for someone like me who has looked at thousands of APIs, it can be very difficult and time consuming to find the API or APIs you are looking for. In 2013 there are even more ways to find APIs, new approaches that are looking to define the next generation of API discovery and consumption. Currently I&rsquo;m tracking on 4 API directories in addition to ProgrammableWeb: APIhub - APIhub is the best way to publish, discover and consume APIs. Search our database or browse through our most popular APIs APIs.io - APIS.io is an open source and free API registry service that allows developers to publish and discover REST APIs and interact with them online Exicon API Directory - Exicon helps marketers and enterprises find qualified developers through our online platform and advisory services Mashape - Mashape provides a world-class marketplace to manage, distribute and consume both private and public APIs by developers from all over the world APIs.io and Exicon have the least amount of APIs available, but both Mashape and APIhub are currently leading, with Mashape possessing over 1500 and APIhub has over 13,000 APIs available. In addition to providing the ability to search APIs and browse by category, these new generation of API directories are providing sophisticated tools like interactive documentation, code samples and ways to follow, share, like--providing social interactions for API developers with API publishers.

			<p><em>24 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Google is migrating samples and tools for App Engine, BigQuery, Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Storage to a new Github account, they are calling the Google Cloud Platform.
Google is going all in with its use of Github, something I'm encouraging API owners to do.  They are working to manage all of their essential API tools there like their start projects, which show developers how to get started with Google APIs as well as other helper tools like the OAuth 2.0 Helper, that helps developers be successful.
Github provides a lot of benefit beyond the obvious aspect of open sourcing your code.  Google is actively engaging with developers using Github alongside all of these open source projects.  If you think about it, this offers a more compelling way to engage with API developers beyond forums.  On forums you end up with a lot of general, sometimes senseless questions--Github anchors questions or issues and pull requests around actual code libraries, SDKs, starter kits and other integration areas.
Github provides potentially more meaningful actions to occur between you and your developer community, beyond making code more accessible and openly licensed.  It is good to see Google going this route.

			<p><em>24 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>This post comes from the&nbsp;SDK Bridge&nbsp;newsletter. &nbsp;I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you. ProgrammableWeb is known for publishing the number of public APIs in its directory, and they regularly present an impressive&nbsp;graph&nbsp;that shows how this number has increased exponentially over time. However, not all APIs are public, and ProgrammableWeb is not able to obtain information on how many non-public APIs exist. SDK Bridge writes API documentation as a service, and many of our customers have us document their non-public APIs. That puts us in a unique position to be able to estimate what percentage of APIs is public compared to non-public. Definitions What exactly is a non-public API? For the purposes of this article, let's define a few terms. Public API.&nbsp;A public API is an API where the documentation is freely available on the Web. Using the API may require registering and paying a fee. Partner API.&nbsp;A partner API is an API where the documentation is not made available to the public, but is made available to select companies who have some kind of partnership agreement with the API provider. Typically the documentation is accessible through a password-protected website. Internal API.&nbsp;An internal API is an API that is only used by developers who work for the company that provides the API. Typically the documentation is available only on an internal website. Data Since its inception in 2008, SDK Bridge has written documentation for 23 web APIs. (Web APIs are only a portion of the writing that we do for software professionals. We also write SDK documentation, IT documentation, and training curricula, as well as create video tutorials for developers.) Of these APIs, 12 were public, 9 were partner, and 2 were internal. The following pie chart shows the breakdown: Web API documentation by type. For the non-public APIs (partner and internal), it's interesting...[<a href="/2013/01/24/estimating-the-number-of-nonpublic-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

Google released an update to the Transparency Report today, showing information regarding government requests for users' data on the Google Network.
Google's transparency report proves details on Government requests including who they come from, where the requests originate, types of requests and other critical information about how our government monitor us citizens and ultimately the entire world online.
There are stories on other blogs that state Facebook and other platforms should follow Google's lead with transparency reports of their own.  I agree.  We will never see our government mandate industry leaders to do this, so us people have to lobby corporations to follow Google's lead.
I see this type of transparency being critical to any company claiming they have an "open platform" or "open APIs".  I will be adding transparency report to my list of legal building blocks for all API owners.
As more and more of our world, economy and daily lives moves online and are transmitted via APIs, investigations by our legal system and government are only going to grow.  We need to establish a way to report on these inquiries in real-time and in an open way like Google has been doing for two years now.

After 2.5 years of telling stories on API Evangelist, I&rsquo;ve gotten pretty good at organizing my ideas, and putting out stories that showcase the best (and worst) from the Business of APIs. I&rsquo;ve gotten so efficient at it in 2012, I even launched API Voice which is dedicated to the politics of APIs, the API Stack which is dedicated to top APIs and Hack Weekends which is all about hackathons. When I meet people in the real world, I often hear, &ldquo;You sure blog a lot, I see like 5 posts a day coming from you!&rdquo; I do write a lot, but it comes in waves. I tend to write a lot of stories all at once, pumping out 15-20 pieces and then I trickle them out across the appropriate domain over the next couple days. In 2013, I&rsquo;m going to get even more efficient with my storytelling, with an evolved approach I&rsquo;m calling Hacker Storytelling. The process is based upon dwhat I already do, but uses a new blend of: Pages - HTML, CSS and text that frames a site, project or research Blogs - Chronological blog posts that walk through a project or research Presentations - Deck.js presentations that walk through a project or research Data - JSON, XML or database stores that drive the essence of a story APIs - Simple, data and representations derived from APIs I use these formats to tell stories across my blog, but in 2012 I learned some new techniques with existing and new technology that &nbsp;I have discovered, and will be employing a series of technologies that help me better deliver stories: Github Pages - A quick, easy and lightweight way to host websites on Github allowing anyone to build site with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

			<p>
Google has an SDK early access program setup for the Google Drive platform, and&nbsp;is inviting a select group of dedicated Google Drive developers to join the program. Giving them access to upcoming Google Drive SDK features and the opportunity to provide feedback.
Google isn't accepting everyone--they will be screening applicants based upon the type and quality of the application, number of users, and ability to implement and provide feedback on new features as they're made available.
An early access program seems like a good idea for API owners.  It gives you the chance to test out your alpha and beta APIs, client libraries, SDK's with a controlled audience, before you release them out into the wild.
With the number of developers Google has, I don't think it will be a problem getting developers to sign up.  But it seems like something you could even pay developers for, if you have a shortage of good developers in your API ecosystem.
An early access program fits right into earlier stories I've done on possible developer incentive ladders within API ecosystems.

			<p><em>21 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>
WSO2's open source API management platform for creating, managing, consuming and monitoring APIs, now has the ability to track API usage through Google Analytics.
Since APIs are deployed using HTTP, the same transport we are using for websites, it makes sense that we should be able to see statistics for both our websites and APIs, side-by-side using Google Analytics.
After creating a new profile for your API in Google Analytics you can put the tracking code into your WSO2 API Management interface and begin seeing real-time or standard (24 hour) reporting on API traffic in the Google Analytics interface.
Since Google Analytics has an API and widgets, you will be able to use this data easily in other reports or system integrations that may need access to your API usage data.
It is great to see innovation around API analytics and reporting, beyond the standard dashboards we've seen from most providers. I'd like to see more stories and scripts to help automate API reporting using Google Analytics, StatsD and Graphite or platforms like Mixpanel.

The event will be a 275 person conference focused on discussing the API industry.
Since the event was postponed after Hurricane Sandy, the demand to get in and speak was overwhelming and conference tickets didn&rsquo;t last long either.
We were able to keep almost all the original session lineup while make a couple changes and squeezing in a couple new speakers, where possible.
I am really pleased with how the event has come together.  We have an amazing lineup and from looking at the attendee list, it looks like it will be a diverse groups of folks in attendance, discussing APIs.
I look forward to seeing you all in New York!

			<p><em>19 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>It has been a while since I provided an update on the White House Digital Strategy. &nbsp;I monitor the progress of federal agencies participation programmatically, using JSON reports published by each agency at the agencies domain, /digitalstrategy. After running the script today, I notice 20 federal agencies with active footprints. &nbsp;There are about five more, but there are issues with the JSON version of their digital stratgies--I really want to focus on the programmatic value. So, across these 20 agencies I find 76 data API initiatives&nbsp;and 75 mobile API projects. To bring you up to speed, there are two specific milestones in the Digital Government Strategy that specifically address API deployment: 2.2 (Data) - Make high-value data and content in at least existing two major customer-facing systems available through web APIs, apply metadata tagging and publish a plan to transition additional high-value systems 7.2 (Mobile) - Optimize at least two existing priority customer-facing services for mobile use and publish a plan for improving additional existing services&nbsp;&nbsp; To help shed light on where these progressive agencies are going with both their data and mobile intiatives I wanted to break them out into separate groups, for each agency.

			<p><em>18 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Backend as a Service (BaaS), sometimes called Mobile Backend is a Service (MBaaS) is a growing trend I&rsquo;m monitoring at API Evangelist.  I&rsquo;m tracking on 20 providers in the space, with two newly added open-source BaaS platforms.
Beyond the research, stories and analysis on BaaS, I just added a BaaS panel at the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference in New York City, February 21st and 22nd.  The panel will include six of the leading BaaS platforms:

Marc Weil (@marcweil) of&nbsp;Cloudmine
James Tamplin (@jamestamplin) of&nbsp;Firebase
Miko Matasumura (@mikojava) of&nbsp;Kii
Morgan Bickle (@morganbickle) of&nbsp;Kinvey
Ilya Sukhar (@ilyasu) of&nbsp;Parse
Ty Amell (@tyamell) of&nbsp;StackMob&nbsp;


API play a critical role in BaaS platforms by providing interfaces for the common services emerging in the BaaS space, like object storage, user management and location, to name a few, but also bring in other 3rd party services like Twitter and Facebook.
I will be moderating this new BaaS panel at APIStrat. Let me know if there are any questions about the space, you&rsquo;d like me to ask.

			<p>Finding APIs that compliment your API, and talking about the mutual benefits is nothing new. When I worked with the print API Mimeo, I would write code that used Mimeo API in conjunction with Box API or Dropbox API. Mashing up or bundling your APIs with other complimentary service can really help, when you are trying to explain the value your API delivers. I&rsquo;m beginning to see patterns of even deeper integration and partnerships between APIs emerge--where one API provider will resell the API of another provider. &nbsp;APIs partnering with other APIs isn&rsquo;t that new, but reselling of each others API services to their developers is a fairly new concept, providing a potential new wholesale channel for API providers. One recent example of this is in a recent partnership between Singly and Cloudmine. Cloudmine is a BaaS provider, and Singly is provider of personal and social data via aggregate APIs. With the reseller approach, Cloudmine developers get a vastly improved stack to develop against, with Cloudmine providing all the essential BaaS tools developers are growing accustomed to, while also having access to 30+ social, personal and other aggregate API services provide by Singly. The goal of this new approach is to provide developers with the most meaningful stack possible, in a single developer area. A MMS API provider like Mogreet could in theory, to better serve their developers, bundle image APIs like Flickr, Instagram and Facebook from Singly into their API area--providing a more robust stack to their developers who are building media enabled mobile apps. Now developers don&rsquo;t have to traverse to each API area on their own. APIs can mashup, bundle and develop a stack, which includes their own APIs, but might also have APIs from potentially several other API providers. &nbsp; Obviously there are lots of details to work out around authentication, pricing, etc., but the potential is obvious.

			<p><em>17 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I just posted a story on how I like the Guardian&rsquo;s approach to data journalism, and spending time evolving on last nights thoughts about the possibilities of Markup APIs.
As I&rsquo;m migrating much of the front-end of my websites to run on a home brew of Github Pages, Jekyll and JSON fueled Mustache Templates, I am seeing more of the potential of not just Markup APIs, but Markdown APIs that will run in a purely client side environment.
Imagine if I could go to a provider like the Guardian, US Census or other high value data provider, grab a link to a Markdown API JavaScript file that is relevant to a story or report you are working on. &nbsp;With this Markdown API I would be given a whole dictionary of markdown you could use.
An example would be, that when I wanted the 2010 population for New York City, I could just write [population|New York|NY|US|2010], or something like that and would print out the actual population for that year in NYC, with a link to the source.  Each time I used a markdown API it would add some sort of attribution to the source at the bottom of document.
Seems like we&rsquo;d establish trusted, centralized sources of information, allowing anyone (even non-developers) to put open data and APIs to use via easy to implement markup or markdown APIs.
Think of the potential if facts around the web actually had the backing of trusted sources, and were able to be embedded anywhere on the web, via apps or digital documents.
It would be fun to create a markup and markdown API for API Evangelist, with a dictionary of terms, facts and other data that were relevant to the API industry.

			<p><em>17 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Emergent One, one of the newest API management players on the block, just announced a new free development tier.
The Emergent One platform provides simple, cloud-based tools for connecting to your MySQL or PostgreSQL database, and quickly generating an API from your database.
I didn&rsquo;t sign up for their service when they first launched, because they didn&rsquo;t have a free tier, and I&rsquo;m unwilling to put in credit cards and commit to brand new services. This is something I have problem with from running development and IT teams who use a wide variety of cloud services.  I would spend a great deal of time each month chasing down charges and other issues from cloud services that were being experimented with.
The Emergent One approach to deploying APIs from common data sources, is one I think will resonate with users who aren&rsquo;t developers, but understand the importance of APIs, and are often restrained by unresponsive, limited or no IT resources.

Emergent One one is responding to user requests for a cheaper tier that support entry level API users, which will allow them to tweak their API strategies before spending money.  This is something I think is mandatory for all API service providers, something 3Scale were the first movers on, and we have seen Apigee implement recently, as well as&nbsp;Layer7 with their Apify.
I notice that in the email announcement of the 100% free tier, it encourages me to build new APIs at no cost, &ldquo;until launch&rdquo;.  I hope Emergent One will agree that a entry level pricing tier is not critical for users to get to know Emergent One, but essential for educating the masses about the value of APIs--allowing them to experiment. So le'ts please make sure it isn&rsquo;t only until launch.
I&rsquo;m setting up some APIs, directly from one of my Amazon RDS instances. &nbsp; I'll let you know when ready.

			<p><em>17 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I am a big fan of APIs that do one thing and do it well, like Twilio.  I had lunch with the team from a similar API yesterday, called Mogreet.
The Mogreet API lets you send and receive text or multimedia messages and use the platform to transcode, host and send video, audio and images for your web or mobile application.
When you think of the popularity of Instagram, the rebirth of Flickr and the ubiquitous value of photos and images online, it just makes sense that MMS is going to play a critical role in mobile app development in 2013.
I have a daughter, who sometimes responds to my SMS, email, chats and facebook messages.  Her attention span doesn&rsquo;t include always responding to her dad in "his" preferred formats. While she was visiting lately I sat on couch and watched her interact with friends and use her iPhone.   I noticed she communicated mostly in photos.

She communicates by taking photos and sending them, tweaking or distorting them and writing messages before sending, and spent a lot of time surfing and sharing silly photos from around the web--all in a social way via her smart phone.
A picture is worth a thousand words.  I'm not good at math, but that seems 6x more valuable than a Tweet.
When you start thinking about which killer features will emerge in our mobile apps this year, I&rsquo;m sure the majority will depend on photos or videos, making MMS a pretty critical API resources to have in your developers toolbox.
After taking a look at Mogreet, I predict we will see them fueling the next crop of meaningful mobile apps, much like Twilio has done for the last two years.

			<p><em>16 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>Over the holidays I added a new section to API Evangelist called "trends". One of the areas I&rsquo;m tracking on is what I&rsquo;m calling &ldquo;scripting platforms&rdquo;. While you can program against any API using the language of your choice, these platforms are aggregating APIs and make available through a custom language stack. This approach is different than what I&rsquo;m seeing from aggregate APIs like Singly. Scripting platforms may offer aggregate APIs, but are also providing a way to easily script against them, in new and abstracted ways. I&rsquo;m still trying to understand each company, as well as the nuances between each approach--so stay tuned. In the last couple weeks, I&rsquo;m seeing a possible new approach to programming against APIs come into focus, one that is using HTML instead of scripting--using Markup APIs. After reading Building Bridges Between GUIs and Code With Markup APIs by Atul Varma (@toolness) from Mozilla, you can really start seeing not just the potential around rich media and content like Mozilla is with its Webmaker platform, but deliver any API resource in abstracted, simplified markup anyone can put to use--without knowing programming. Lyre Calliope takes this further discussing how, &ldquo;Webmaker could be an opportunity to define an embeddable API strategy for the entire web&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;a Singly Markup API would lower the learning threshold for anyone interested in remixing all of their personal information together in new ways&rdquo;, in&nbsp;Markup APIs and the Read/Write Web. I envision Markup APIs, at their simplest working like Mustache Templates where you can easily render data from JSON templates, or be as robust as what Mozilla is doing with their Webmaker platform. &nbsp;Making the web embeddable and remixable like Lyre says.&nbsp; While scripting platforms are providing an important evolution in APIs for developers, by aggregating top APIs into new resources, the Markup API approach is an interesting evolution in APIs for everyone. &nbsp;And with browser based authentication solutions like Singly's, we can make this a...[<a href="/2013/01/16/markup-apis-and-api-scripting-platforms/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I stumbled across the Google Civic Information API today, which allows developers to build applications around civic information including polling place, early vote location, candidate data, and election official information.  As soon as I landed on the home page, I scanned the left hand navigation, and noticed the option for "embeddable tool".
As you know embeddable tools are are something I advocate all API owners should consider when assembling the building blocks of your API.  I like Google's approach to the Google Voter Information Tool, which lets users look up their polling place, early vote sites, ballot, and election official information for the US 2012 General Election.
To support the embeddable tool, Google provides a quick overview, with instructions for "quick embed" and more granular options allowing anyone to configure region, address, local and other advanced settings.
Even though the 2012 election is over, I think Google's approach to providing embeddable tools with their APIs is potentially something that other API owners can follow, which will make your API accessible beyond just the developer community.

			<p><em>10 Jan 2013</em></p>
			<p>The mission of API Evangelist is centered around telling stories from the API space, shedding light on the innovative things developers and API providers are doing across all business sectors. Over the holidays I rolled my history of APIs series into its own section. It can be very difficult to understand who the players were in the API game, last year, let alone 10 years ago. If there aren&rsquo;t stories about what happened in 2001, it can be very difficult to piece together the history. In 2012 I also scaled up my API monitoring system to track the blogs and tweets of over 1000 APIs, providing a way for me to track activity across the space and establish my own API ranking system resulting in what I cal&nbsp;the API Stack. This too is very dependent on API owners telling or sharing stories around their operations. I&rsquo;m tracking on over 1500 APIs and only 1000 have blogs and Twitter accounts. With very few other signals to follow, such as stories in the blogosophere, social bookmarks on Hacker News and Reddit or QA on Quora or Stack Overflow--there isn&rsquo;t much to discover about these potentially valuable APIs. At first, I felt there was a flaw in the way I track on APIs. If an API offers value, but there are no stories for me to track on, it won&rsquo;t show up on my radar--leaving me feeling my approach could be flawed. On the flip side, going into 2013 I am eager to find &ldquo;new&rdquo; stories of APIs, feeling like I&rsquo;m constantly telling stories of Amazon and Netflix--contrasting this with the lack of stories around 500 of my APIs, I felt there is an important link. There is a reason I tell so many stories about Netflix isn't chance, it is because Netflix shares so much about its operations, providing fuel for my analysis and storytelling. To shed light on this, I sat down with Daniel Jacobson (@daniel_jacobson),...[<a href="/2013/01/10/netflix-storytelling-and-why-you-should-tell-stories-of-your-platform/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>If you've met me in person, you know I always wear my logo on my t-shirt. &nbsp;I'm not a graphic designer, and when I needed a logo for API Evangelist, I just wrapped the words in JSON and called it good. &nbsp;It has stuck. &nbsp;
When I was in France speaking at API Days, the art director at faberNovel&nbsp;drew some very cool sketches of me. &nbsp;He recently followed up with some more high resolution images I can use for t-shirts. &nbsp;

Very cool! Thank you so much Benoit Talabot and faberNovel! &nbsp;I'm working on ordering some t-shirts using the work, right now on Inkd.

			<p>
I'm rebooting the marketing and PR for the API Strategy &amp; Practice conference after the holidayz. After finding a new date for the event on February 21st and 22nd, we've gone through the session and speaker lineup and almost the entire line-up is coming back, with a couple of new entries including a new keynote from&nbsp;Jeff Lawson of Twilio.
We had a whole bunch of new requests for speaker additions over the holidays, and while we tried to squeeze in where we could, with such a killer lineup and the fact that everyone was committed to the new dates, we had to decline some pretty good talks.

Over the next week we are going through and confirming with all registered attendees to verify they will be attending, but since the event was sold out before hurricane Sandy, I expect we will be announcing the event as sold out pretty soon.
The event is designed to be an intimate 2 days between 300 industry professionals in the API space. &nbsp;So I recommend if you are excited about APIs in 2013, make sure and head over to API Strategy &amp; Practice site and register before its 100% sold out.

			<h3><a href="/2012/12/30/history-of-apis-programmableweb/">History of APIs:  ProgrammableWeb</a></h3>
			<p><em>30 Dec 2012</em></p>
			<p>While writing about the&nbsp;history of APIs, it is easy to be so focused on just APIs, that you overlook the single most important player in the entire history of the web API--ProgrammableWeb. In July 2005, John Musser started ProgrammableWeb. According to his original about page: ProgrammableWeb is a web-as-platform reference site and blog delivering news, information and resources for developing applications using the Web 2.0 APIs. I started this site because I couldn't find what I was looking for: a technology focused&nbsp;starting point for web platform development. (For a bit more see my initial post.) Although no guarantees, the last time I started a reference site it somehow became Google's highest rated link on the topic. Given that this site will be a collaborative effort with community input as well, this can be what we make it. I hope you find the site useful. John Musser - Seattle, August 2005 I think John&rsquo;s&nbsp;original blog post&nbsp;on why he started ProgrammableWeb, says it all:&nbsp;Why? Because going From Web Page to Web Platform is a big deal. Web APIs are a big deal! Whether its social networking, government, healthcare or education--having a programmable platform to make data and resources available will be a critical part of how commerce and society operates from here on forward. &nbsp;&nbsp; John made a early decision to showcase open and RESTful approaches to deploying APIs vs. parallel attempts of&nbsp;Service Oriented Architecture(SOA) and&nbsp;Web Services, and focused on telling stories about open APIs--way before it was the thing to do in Silicon Valley. When I started API Evangelist in July 2010 (5 years after PW), and started talking about the business of APIs, the technology of web APIs was already widely accepted in Silicon Valley, because of the stories John Musser and Adam Duvander have told on ProgrammableWeb. As we close 2012, a year in which I think we can confidently say APIs are moving mainstream, and I feel we owe much of the success...[<a href="/2012/12/30/history-of-apis-programmableweb/">Read More</a>]</p>
