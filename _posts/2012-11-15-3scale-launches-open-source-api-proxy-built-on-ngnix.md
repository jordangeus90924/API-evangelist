Those of you who follow my blog, know my favorite API management service provider is [3Scale][1]. It’s no secret I’m a fan of what they are doing. We share a vision of the API space and what a healthy API industry will look like.

In support of that vision, 3Scale just launched a new open source API proxy build on the [NGNIX][2] web server technology--a move, I feel is important for 3Scale, as well as the entire API industry.

What makes 3Scale’s approach signficant, is that by deploying the NGNIX proxy, API providers don't need to rely on proprietary API proxy solutions, while also gaining additional benefits, such as acess to a library of 3rd party [addons][3] and [modules][4] available in the NGNIX ecosystem. All while employing an established technology that has been proven to deliver in highl volume production environments.

In addition to the benefits provided by NGNIX, the proxy provides seamless integration with 3Scale’s API management platform that delivers:

  * API business modeling using service contracts, API rate limits and pricing rules
  * API access control
