<p>I am happy to assist you in the design of your API. I'm a big fan of simple, pragmatic API design, and willing to help you better achieve your API design objectives, and follow the best patterns possible out of the gate.</p>
<p>If nothing else, I can just add an extra layer of awarness to your team, and maybe consider a few things that you may not have, saving you some headache down the road. There are many existing patterns available to follow when it comes to designing your API -- let me know if I can help you find them.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I am what you are needing, but I'm happy to explore it with you. If I can't help you, maybe one of my network of partners can help--head over <a href="http://apievangelist.com/contact/">to my contact page, and choose the channel</a> that works for you.</p>
<p>Make sure and also look at <a href="http://apievangelist.com/services/">my wider list of API services that I offer</a>, to see if there is something else I can help you with along the way.</p>
