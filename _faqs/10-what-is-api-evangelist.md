API Evangelist began as a research project in 2010, attempting to understand what was happening with web APIs. Over the years the blog has continued as the learning research playground for Kin Lane, the API Evangelist, and Chief Evangelist for Postman./

Recently, with a refresh of the blog, others are contributing. Pascal Heus has stepped up to help contributing some valuable thinking and storytelling around the intersection of data, standards, and API. The website runs 100% on GitHub, and anyone is welcome to submit a blog post.
