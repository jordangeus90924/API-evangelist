			<p><em>16 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>I have been slowly adding Postman Collections to many of the APIs indexes&nbsp;for my new master stack. I index each API using an APIs.json file, as well as provide a master APIs.json which brings together all of the APIs, into the single portal I've published to Github. Within some of the APIs, you will see a Postman icon, allowing you to easily import the API definition into postman, directly from each APIs landing page. When I first published that I was publishing these Postman collections on my Alpha API Evangelist blog, someone from the donation API platform Just Giving said they also prepare Postman collections for their developers, and publish them to Github for their API consumers:&nbsp; At JustGiving we give our API consumers a set of collections to import to make their jobs even easier, we also use the "Environments" feature to substitute different values depending on whether you're using our Sandbox or Production environment - it's a real time saver and also helps when supporting our API consumers. I feel pretty strongly that Postman is a measurable unit for transactions in the API economy, and I feel it goes a long way in helping API consumers onboard with each new API. As a developer, if I can import a Postman Collections into my client, within just a couple clicks, and be up and running with an API--I am going to be a much happier camper, and be that much closer to integration. I'm considering adding Postman collections as a building block under API on-boarding, and encourage API providers to follow JustGivings lead. Postman Collections is kind of the new API explorer, allowing developers to quickly test drive an API they are going to integrate with. With my own platform, I'm also going to play with publishing Postman Collections, complete with API keys that I refresh regularly, allowing immediate, but limited access my APIs, for anyone who stumble across them.&nbsp; Like Swagger, Postman is...[<a href="/2015/04/16/preparing-postman-collections-ahead-of-time-for-developers-like-justgiving-does/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>I have had Steve Willmotts of 3Scale's response to the announcement that Twitter was cutting off firehose access for over a week now, and bringing the higher level access completely in house via their Gnip acquisition. You can read the response from Gnip via their blog post&nbsp;Working Directly With the Twitter Data Ecosystem, and from DataSift in their&nbsp;The Twitter/Gnip Gap: Data Licensing vs Data Processing. Steve and I are in agreement with the points made via his How Not to be a Platform: Twitter&rsquo;s Firehose Mistake post. Where I really struggled with over the last week, in producing a official response, was after responding How To Be A Platform: Making Tough Partnership Choices, from my friend Tyler Singletary.&nbsp; You see, I agree with everything Tyler pointed as well. He's right. Twitter has probably made the right decision for Twitter, and based upon their goals and understanding of the Twitter API ecosystem, did exactly what should be prescribed. I have lots of opinions around the Twitter ecosystem, and how&nbsp;Twitter Continues to Restrict Access to Our Tweets. However, when I step back, and put on my API operations hat, everything Tyler points out, is valid in my opinion. Twitter gets to decide who has access, and in respect to their goals, chooseing the Gnip offering over the DataSift offering makes sense. It's all about the winning solution, and where the ROI is when it comes platform operations? Life is good when you are on the winning team. However #winning != #good, and #winning != best outcome. I also guess, that #open != good, and #open != best outcome either. There are no absolutes in API land--sorry. Where Tyler stance really begin to lose its shine for me, is when you zoom out. You see Tyler, you are on the winning team. You have access to the firehose, and you operate squarely within in the #winning conversation (I know you don't have direct firehose, and rely on Gnip)....[<a href="/2015/04/16/on-twitter-gnip-datasift-and-making-the-hard-platform-decision/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>14 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>The most important stories told across the API space, the ones that have the biggest impact on API providers, and ultimately API consumers, are the stories that come out of the trenches of the API operations at the leading public API providers. This is why 3Scale and API Evangelist started APIStrat, and what the audiences over the last 3 years of operating APIDays and APIStrat have consistently requested--more stories from the trenches. With this in mind, we've asked S&eacute;bastien Cevey (@theefer) of The Guardian to come to @APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe 2015, and share a story from API operations at the worlds leading media API provider. S&eacute;bastien wanted to share their view of what Hypermedia APIs are, by comparing them to a classical RPC architecture and ad-hoc "JSON APIs". He will also cover key benefits of using Hypermedia APIs (cacheability, discoverability, evolveability/extensibility, simplicity, interactive nature), presented in the context of real-world examples and the different constraints of REST (HTTP, URIs, verbs, hypermedia controls like links and forms). What I like about S&eacute;bastien viepoint, is 1) he works at one of the most progressive media outlets in the world, where he is actually putting APIs to work, and 2) his pragmatic approach. S&eacute;bastien will talk about what hypermedia APIs are, anchoring his lessons in real-world examples from Guardian operations, but he will also discuss the caveats of this API style, acknowledging the realities of API operations. There are no perfect solutions, but technologists like S&eacute;bastien&nbsp;are pushing the discipline of API design forward, while also balancing with the real-world reality that exists in their workplaces. The keynote from S&eacute;bastien Cevey (@theefer) of The Guardian, will kick off the first day of @APIDaysBerlin / @APIStrat Europe 2015, so make sure you are registered today, so you don't get locked out when we sell out (which we are very close).

			<p><em>10 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>I've been monitoring an emerging slice of the API, that has been dubbed "microservices" for some time now, and you've even heard me explore its use, when describing my architectural approach to redesigning more core API stack for my internal systems. I&rsquo;m slowly redesigning my internal API stack, keeping them as small as possible, throughout all aspects of operations, deploying each endpoint in a single dockerized container, that contains the OS, database, web server and all server side API code. I'm also using Github, in conjunction with APIs.json to assist me in my orchestration, throughout every aspect of these APIs lifecycle from design to testing&mdash;all a new approach for me when managing my APIs. Is defining my APIs in this way, so that the definition is much more than just the actual API endpoints, but also include the entire backend, and lifecycle workflow Microservices? Fuck if I know. One thing I do know, is I've had enough conversations with folks who are doing microservices, resulting in me saying&nbsp;several times that the micro services definition is something very personal. Something which the first 10 times I said , sounded very positive, but after experiencing multiple people telling me what I'm doing isn't microservices, I can tell the term definitely will continue to be very personal&mdash;very much in the same way conversations around REST or Hypermedia has gotten personal on forums, and HN threads. You know what this tells me about microservices? Is it is more about power, control and influence, everything from enterprise architects stating their endorsement of the concept, down to the individual architects, who love to make sure you know that the way you are doing it, is WRONG! I don't think there is a single definition of "microservice", and much like REST, I think we'll hear plenty of &ldquo;right&rdquo; definitions, by the enterprise justifying what they are doing, and those who are selling something to the enterprise. Is there anything wrong with this?...[<a href="/2015/04/10/on-apis-and-microservices/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>This is something I talk about often, but it has been a while since I&rsquo;ve done a story dedicated to it, so I wanted to make sure and take a fresh look at what I&rsquo;d consider to be a minimum viable footprint for any API&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care if it is public or not. This definition has grown out of five years of monitoring the approach taken by leading API providers, and is also baked into what I&rsquo;d consider to be a minimum viable APIs.json definition&mdash;which provides an important index for API operations. What do I want to see when I visit a developer area? More importantly, what does your average developer, or API consumer need when they land on your API portal? Let&rsquo;s look at the basics: Portal - A clean, easily accessible, prominently place portal landing page. This shouldn&rsquo;t be buried with your help section, it should be located at developer.[yourdomain].com. ' Description - As soon as developers land, they need a simple, concise explanation of what an API does. Actually describe what the API does, not just that it provides programmatic access to your products and services. Getting Started - Give everyone, even non-developers as place to start, helping us understand what is needed to get started with API integration, from signing up for an account to where do I find support. Documentation - Deliver, simple, clean, and up to date documentation, preferably of the interactive kind with a Swagger or API Blueprint behind. Authentication - Help developers understand authentication. There are a handful of common approaches from BasicAuth, and API keys, to oAuth--provide a simple overview of how authentication is handled. Self-Service Registration - How do I sign up? Give me a link to a self-service account signup, and make it as easy for me to create my new account, and go from idea to live integration as fast as possible&mdash;don&rsquo;t make me wait for initial approval, that can come later.

			<p><em>10 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>Somewhere during my weekly monitoring I found the Fiber Locator API, which like all APIs, especially the ones that ask me to &ldquo;request access&rdquo;, I signed up for the service. Understanding where telecommunications companies have laid fiber optic cable, for me, equals a potentially valuable API resource&mdash;sure I would consider integrating these resources into my applications, and systems. I&rsquo;m never a big fan of APIs, who make you request access vs self-service registration, but if the API has value, I jump through hoops, so I can can better understand what an API does, which according to the Fiber Locator site: FiberLocator offers an application programming interface that gives you access to our database of over 265+ carriers, over 272,000 carrier lit buildings locations and 3,000+ data centers. We created our API services so that client companies can augment their own systems and analyses with our unique data sets. I filled out the form, providing my name, email, phone and company name, the provided the additional details: I am the API Evangelist, and I&rsquo;d like to write a story about the Fiber Locator API. Something I do a lot. Within 24 hours I received: Then I got this: Both of these emails I replied with the same additional details I included with my request for API access. I received a third solicitation, but felt it didn't add any value to the conversation. From what I can tell, the Fiber Locator API is simply a lead generation form, which routes to sales people&mdash;I see no evidence of an API. Maybe there is something really there, if there is, this is not how you on-board people. I may just be writing a story about the API, which you should probably encourage, but that is just me, but if you really want developers to integrate fiber location into their applications and internal systems, you should probably let us kick the tires, see what the service is all about.

			<p><em>10 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>APIs are very much a virtual concept, something that is very abstract, often difficult to explain, and is something that very much lives in the online world. Spending much of my daily life in this world, I&rsquo;m always excited to come across APIs that bridge this digital world, with our existing physical worlds. At first read, you might think I&rsquo;m talking about the recent growth of Internet of Things APIs, that are connecting physical devices like our thermostats and smoke alarms, to our mobile devices, using APIs. This is part of it, but for this post I&rsquo;m referencing APIs that don&rsquo;t just connect to objects in our physical world, but they actually bind to existing experiences, processes, and other aspects of our personal and professional worlds. The Link Creation Studio from HP, is this. Using the web interface, or the API, you can create QR codes, and images with digital watermarks, which can be printed, then any user with a mobile device can snap a picture, which then triggers an action, that then takes the user to a specific location online--providing a bridge from a printed object in our physical world, to an online extension of that object. This bridge comes with the ability to manage the action that is embedded in print, and the resulting online link destination. You can print the QR code, and digital watermarks, and over time see analytics for each user that traverses the bridge, from print to web page. Link Creation Studio users can also manage this experience, and change it over time to get the resulting experience, that both the publisher, and users desire. The Link Creation Studio is a simple, but very powerful tool for building bridges between our physical and online worlds. The fact that it has an API is extremely significant, allowing these bridges to be built in real-time, from any system, whether that is a classic business print situation like business cards and product...[<a href="/2015/04/10/bridging-our-virtual-and-physical-worlds-with-the-link-creation-studio/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>This is a topic I&rsquo;ve had an increasing number of conversation with folks about in the last couple months, and a friend of mine Tweeted in response to today, resulting in this lovely rant. This is about two very separate problems, in which the solutions are what I'd consider significantly overlapped. I&rsquo;m talking about the need to make sure the valuable metadata, as well as underlying resources made available via an API is accessible to search engines, while also making sure the it is all Section 508 compliant, providing critical access to people with disabilities. In response to my recent post, on "Why The New API Blueprint Sharing Button From Apiary Is So Important&rdquo;, said: I'm heavy user of @apiaryio but disappointed with discoverability features of the product. Google just ignores them. https://t.co/w0hcGmpgMd &mdash; Kristopher Kleva (@klevland) April 9, 2015 First, this is another reason why the API Blueprint being more open is important, anyone can now come along and not just build an SEO API documentation solution, they can get access to Apiary.io users who desire such a solution. Ok, that might seem bad for Apiary, but in situations that Apiary is not concerned with, this allows the community to step up and serve the long tail, and if it is something that concerns Apiary, it lights the fire under their ass to consider adding to the road map (sorry Jakub &amp; Z, I know I"m a pain ;-). Second, it allows the community to step up and serve what I'd consider the critical long tail&mdash;like Section 508. In our rush to deliver the latest in technological innovations, we often forget about significant portions of our society who, well, aren&rsquo;t like us.

			<p><em>09 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I was just doing on of my regular check-ins with Pratap Ranade (@pratapranade), the CEO of Kimono. We try to make time to catchup on what each other are up to, and find where we can work together to incite API evolution. Pratap sees the space like I do, that APIs are more than tech, possessing huge potential when it comes to empowering folks to make change within their companies, organizations, institutions, government agencies, and the wider industries and countries they exist in.
Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t go into too much detail about the projects we are working on until they are ready, but I just spend over an hour talking through some pretty interesting use cases that have occurred via Kimono Labs, in which Kimono users are scraping data and content from existing websites, and crafting some pretty interesting APIs. I&rsquo;m not just talking about the fun things like March Madness or World Cup going on over at Kimono, I&rsquo;m talking about influencing elections, addressing disaster recovery issues, and providing timely data that can influence how financial markets are working (or not).
The best part about these stories, is the work is being done, in many cases by people who don't have traditional programming skills, they are more hackers who have identified a problem, and used Kimono to scrape the data, and generate simple APIs, that help provide a new way of delivering API-driven solutions to the problem being targeted. Pratap said they are quickly becoming a big data company as well as a structured data API solution, because of the number of folks stepping up to address the long tail of data.
I just wanted to provide a taste of what we are working on. I&rsquo;m always left pumped up about potential of APIs, after hearing what Kimono is up to. If you want a taste of some of the stories I'm talking about, check out the Kimono blog.

			<p>This is another story that came to mind while listening to the last episode of Traffic and Weather. As John and Steve were talking about the API definition format Swagger switching from Reverb to SmartBear (thanks for shout-out about my Swagger post), they were discussing how Microsoft is using Swagger as part of platform operations, and made sure and reminded us listeners that all this has been done before. Bringing up a never-ending theme &nbsp;in the world of APIs, that we just can't seem to shake loose. When people bring this up, what do they mean? Yes, modern API definitions like Swagger, are very much like earlier incarnations of WSDL and WADL. Ok. What now? We shouldn&rsquo;t do it? It won&rsquo;t work? Don&rsquo;t even bother with Swagger? We should learn from history, and earlier efforts, and make sure we don't same mistakes? We should be scared of Swagger, and run for the hills, hide in a bunker? We should all switch back to SOAP and use WSDL? You just like to tell me I'm wrong, and has nothing to do with technology? Why I bring this up, is because more often than not, most of these conversation lean towards the first response &mdash; don&rsquo;t even bother, except you don&rsquo;t really know because people who state &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve already done this&rdquo;, often leave it open ended, offering no constructive criticism. Some even close it with, this is nothing new! Ok, so what then? How does that impact my decision making, now. I guess, for me, I step back at look at how this applies to the rest of my world. Do we do this with all other trends in our lives? We already did short skirts, why do we gotta do them again? I heard on NPR the other day that open office plan was invented by the Germans in the 1950s, and proven in-effective by the 1970s, and here in this decade we are doing again....[<a href="/2015/04/09/here-we-go-again-soa-and-api-we-have-already-done-this/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
Yay! Another story generated by listening to Traffic and Weather&nbsp;(blame John and Steve). I do enjoy sharing my random thoughts while listening to those two. This one is around the SDK discussion during the latest episode, but as they noted, they&rsquo;ve talked about SDKs a lot in the past. This particular reference was again, during the their discussion about Microsoft using Swagger to generate code&mdash;a topic which brought up the usual grumbles from John about SDKs. He loves to hate on SDKs, obviously suffering from severe SDK PTSD.
I agree with his feelings about SDKs, they are well founded, but auto-generating code from Swagger doesn&rsquo;t always involve with the generation of full-blown SDKs. I save a huge amount of time, auto-generating different types of code and scripts from Swagger, which I further clean up and make work for my specific needs. My experience with generating code from Swagger, is more about saving time, than it is about producing production ready SDKs.
Maybe my development world is unique, but I find I still have to get my hands dirty, even when I generate server or client side code using Swagger, requiring me to still play with HTTP and understand response / request details. I get what John is saying, and he is right. I'm increasingly frustrated by companies producing platforms that are more SDK than API, something IoT engineers excel at.
I just wanted to point out there are many layers to the discussion, and that there are no perfect solutions when auto-generating code from API definitions, but it can sure save time in both API deployment, as well as API consumption, and unlike SDKs I still understand the inner working of my apps, integrations, and the APIs they are depending on.

			<p><em>08 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I had one of my followers ask me if there as a &ldquo;gold standard for API deprecation policies&rdquo; out there. I&rsquo;d say that deprecation policies are a little different than some of the other legal building blocks of an API, where the legal is a small portion of it, with the majority really being all about communication.
To answer the question, I recommended Google. Not cause their deprecation policy itself is all the great, it is just because their overall approach to API deprecation is pretty robust&mdash;something I&rsquo;m sure is derived from their experience so far. (wink wink)
API deprecation at Google starts with some pretty clearly stated policies, but goes much further with:

Deprecation Policy
Deprecation Schedule
Data Deprecation Details
Blog Communication

These are just a handful of the building blocks that Google employs as part of their approach to API documentation. This post is just result of a 15 minutes of Googling around, to respond to the question. Now that I have written this post, and put the topic of API deprecation back on my radar, the next step is to dive deeper and develop a complete picture of how Google approaches API deprecation, as well as other leading players in the space.
At first take, it appears to me that the legal details of API deprecation that are present in terms of use, or as standalone documents is only the start. The winning examples of API deprecation involve making sure deprecation details are always readily available, regularly communicated, and are comprehensive enough to cover the API, data, and other things that matter to developers and end-users.

			<p>If I find a new company during my research, it takes me about a minimum of 15 minutes to lightly profile what they are up, and add to my system, and if I do a full profile, it can take several hours. All of this adds up to a lot of work, time that would be better spent on actually writing stories, hacking on the APIs, and publishing of the longer form research papers on what I&rsquo;m seeing. In an ideal world, each of these APIs would have an APIs.json in the root of their domain, with details about the company and people responsible for API operations, and as much information about each API as possible. With a single click, I could import the entire profile of a company, and its valuable API resources into my monitoring system, ready for publishing to relevant areas of the API Evangelist network, as well as some of my partner sites like APIs.io--the beauty is, so could anyone else. ;-) If API providers used APIs.json, I could be connected to their Blog via RSS, their platform Twitter account via the Twitter API, and their Github profile or organization using the Github API. Not only would I have relevant metadata about a company like their name, description, logo, and details about APIs, I would also be connected to a real-time heartbeat of API operations via the platform blog, Twitter, and Github accounts. This is just the start--there are numerous other building blocks you could wire up with an APIs.json file, to keep potential consumers up to speed. I know it can be hard to se the potential for APIs.json, because there is limiting tooling available currently, beyond the open source search engine APIs.io, Even before the next wave of tooling like the internal enterprise search engine, visualizations, browser plugins, and other tooling are available, you can realize the benefit of being listed on APIs.io, and make sure you are fully...[<a href="/2015/04/08/the-work-it-takes-to-connect-and-keep-up-with-each-valuable-api-i-come-across/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>This story is derived from listening to the API podcast, Traffic and Weather. One of the things John Sheehan (@johnsheehan), and Steve Marx (@smarx) discussed during the recent show, was a post Steve wrote as part of his role as product manager, called "How many HTTP status codes should your API use"? I think the story is extremely useful to read, helping us all think through how we use HTTP status codes in our own platform, but personally I think the real story, is Dropbox talking out loud about their strategy. John and Steve pointed out on the podcast that someone had tweeted that the story was not in sync with the way Dropbox actually did their HTTP status codes. To which Steve replied, that is why he wrote the story, to talk it out, and solicit feedback. This is how you should be thinking through your API road map, out loud, on your platform blog. When I mention to API providers that the blog is the most important tool in their toolbox, this is what I mean. Your blog isn&rsquo;t just for broadcasting your platform message, it is also about you thinking through thoughts, sharing those thoughts with your API consumers, and potentially getting feedback, which you can consider as part of the overall decision making process. I am addicted to thinking through my ideas publicly on my blog. For me, a thought isn&rsquo;t fully formed, until its published. I also depend heavily on the feedback from my audience to my stories, in their public comments on Disqus, and Twitter, as well as privately via email and DMs. Talking things through, publicly on your blog, teaches you to think outside the box, let the sunlight in on your thoughts, and forces you to (potentially) properly form your ideas (not always), at least enough to share with the public--even if you don&rsquo;t end up getting feedback, that process alone, is highly valuable.

			<p><em>08 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>As my Internet of Things (IoT) research continues, I&rsquo;m applying much of my API thinking from the mainstream API space to the world of IoT. A couple weeks ago I stumbled across the 3D Robotics Drone API, which to my surprise, was documented using a Swagger specification, providing a machine readable definition of the API, which helped me quickly get up to speed on what the Drone API delivers. I haven't put much thought into the detail for any drone APIs, something that has been adjacent to my mainstream research for over a year now, but I did have some basic opinions about what a drone API could have. So, when it comes to potential resources, I have to say the 3D Robotics Drone API delivers in all earlier areas I had been considering--with five main endpoints: The Vehicle API - Exposes operations for browsing and searching lists of vehicle, and retrieving single vehicle, including airspeed, ground speed, and battery. The Mission API -&nbsp;Exposes operations for browsing and searching lists of mission, and retrieving single mission. The Administrator API - Access to administrative resources including debugging, logging, and flight simulation. The User API - Access operations for browsing and searching lists of user, and retrieving single user. Authentication - Session operations for logging in and out, and identifying user. The vehicle stuff I expected, but I was pleasantly surprised to see the resources around logging, and specifically the mission API. When it comes to transparency, and accountability around drone activity, I feel pretty strongly that these types of resources will be essential, and eventually will be mandated by government entities. I&rsquo;m glad that 3D Robotics is ahead of the game, in providing API driven resources that deliver in this way. What I didn&rsquo;t expect, when I stumbled across the user and mission management APIs, was the social, online layer. As part of the 3D Robotics Drone API platform, the company offers DroneShare, where you can...[<a href="/2015/04/08/considering-the-3d-robotics-drone-api-as-potential-blueprint-for-the-drone-industry/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>I was dedicating some time to researching APIs in the Internet of things (IoT) space, and stumbled across the Myfox API, serving the Myfox home security products. While the developer portal for the Myfox API doesn't have everything I'd like to see in an IoT developer portal, it is one of the better one's I've seen. If you think web or mobile app developers suck at providing a simple, and a coherent developer portal and experience, device platform providers are even worse. The Myfox API, has the essential building building blocks, with a simple overview, authentication info, simple Swagger driven API documentation, application management tools, and a clear terms of service for the platform. Additionally, there is a clear link between the primary Myfox website, the developer portal, and a myfox.me user portal, for device consumers and would-be developers to easily on-board with everything. I haven't fully profiled that Myfox platform, but at first glance it is clean, well laid out, and most importantly the link between the website, API, and user accounts is clear, and easy to navigate. As I think this through, and after recently finishing a white paper called Building an API-driven Ecosystem for the Internet of Things, for the now defunct GigaOm, I can't help but think the IoT space is going to need to agree on some sort of standard approach for not just managing how they design, deploy, and manage APIs, but also how they deliver developer and user portals. To help you visualize what I mean, consider the number of Internet connected devices any single household will own, all with their own portal, and on-boarding process. #FUN In short, developers, and end-users will get IoT account fatigue pretty quick. I don't think that we are going to standardize everything across the space, I am not delusional, but I can't help but think that the sharing of some common blueprints, could go a long ways in reducing friction for...[<a href="/2015/04/08/a-little-standardization-around-how-we-do-internet-of-things-iot-apis-and-developer-portals-could-go-a-long-ways/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>API design service provider Apiary, quietly launch a new sharing button for API Blueprints, in their interactive API documentation, the other week. They added a setting in their account area, which allows users to be more open with their API designs: "Start sharing your API blueprint with other API enthusiasts, by enabling this feature within your API settings. Simply toggle the &lsquo;Public Blueprint&rsquo; setting on and you&rsquo;re ready to start sharing your API blueprint.&rdquo; also stating that, &ldquo;this is just the beginning of being able to socialize and learn from other public API blueprints." Now we you are visiting the Apiary driven API documentation for common platforms like: Akamai Imaging API Relayr Definition API Loader.io From SendGrid CloudBreak From SequenceIQ The machine readable API Blueprint definition, driving the documentation now has the potential to be accessible. This may not seem like much, but it is actually fundamental to the health, and growth of the overall API industry. Developers cannot learn from other developers, and from leading API platforms, and share best practices for API design across the space without it&mdash;we need this to grow, and evolve. This is one of the reasons Swagger has seen such wide adoption, because it isn&rsquo;t just an open format, it is also because the API definitions that these public platforms generate are also available to share, and learn from. You can still lock down the valuable resources made available via an API, but the interface patterns we apply to our APIs should be shared as widely as possible, for everyone to see. This is why I&rsquo;ve been fighting so hard to push back against Oracle in their API copyright case against Google&mdash;API designs do not need to be locked up.

I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to be able to cut back on my travel in 2015, and focus on some important research, coding, and writing. I apologize to all the events I&rsquo;ve said no to over the last couple months, but I hit a wall last year with speaking, and trying hard to make 2015 a much more healthier, and balanced year.
With that said, here is where you can find me this spring. I have three places you can find me in April and May:

Berlin, Germany&nbsp;- You can find me in Berlin, putting on @APIDays / @APIStrat, April 24th &amp; 25th
Barcelona, Catalonia - I will be speaking at APIDays Mediterranea, May 6th &amp; 7th, in Barcelona
Broomfield, CO 

@APIStrat Tech Un-Workshops @ Gluecon May 19th (1:00-5:00 PM)
Leading the Swagger conversation at Swagger API Meetup @ Gluecon May 19th (7:00-9:00 PM)
Gluecon - I will be at Gluecon 2015, May 20th, and 21st, speaking



That is all the speaking I&rsquo;m doing this spring, with one tentative date early in June at BYU. I won&rsquo;t be traveling again until the fall, when we do @APIStrat again, and of course @DefragCon!
I&rsquo;m excited to be in Berlin and Barcelona, two of my favorite European cities, and of course Broomfield, CO (specifically the Taproom). I am also excited to not be traveling as much, and able to focus on my wider research, coding, and writing. #thanks

			<p><em>07 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>I spend a lot of time looking through the developer portals of API providers. I see a lot of things, both the good and bad, while navigating these portals, and while some of the bad stuff I see are way too big for me to doing anything, there are many little things I see that I could help do something about. Sometimes it is just spelling mistakes, sometimes broken links, and other times I want to rewrite API descriptions, and add to the resources that are available for an API. During these travels, I got to thinking...what if API providers published their developer portals to Github? Just like I do with my API Evangelist sites. Then I could fork their portal, and submit pull requests with rewrites of the description of what your API does, adding little tweaks, here and there, helping polish the portal--potentially making things easier for developers. I&rsquo;m sure this thought scares the hell out of some companies, who can&rsquo;t imagine, allowing outside input like this, but if you sit down and think about it for a while, it just might make sense. When I was in Washington D.C., I created a default portal template that runs on Github. I might upgrade this, and make it available for API providers to use as a forkable template, to seed any API developer portal. Doing this makes it easy to provide a base set of building blocks that every API provider should start with, allowing them to delete the elements that they don&rsquo;t want. I am also considering making a default one, that can be used as a starter developer portal for Internet of Things (IoT) platforms.

			<p>The one thing I've learned in five years as the API Evangelist is that us technologists and developers don't always see the world like everyone else. We focus on the perfection of the technology, our own desires for the future, and often miss the mark on what end-users actually need. This is one of the hallmark success of APIs over SOA, is that by accident, APIs jumped out of the SOA petri dish (thanks Daniel Jacobson - @daniel_jacobson), and was use solve everyday problems that end-users face, using the technology that is readily available (aka HTTP). While I think us API folks have done a great job of delivering valuable resources to mobile applications, and a decent enough job at delivering the same resources to web applications, and I guess we are figuring out the whole device thing? maybe? maybe not? Regardless, one area we have failed to serve a major aspect of the business world, is delivering valuable API resources to the number #2 client in the world&mdash;the spreadsheet. We have done a decent job of providing resources to data stewards, helping them deploy APIs using spreadsheets using services like API Spark, but other than a handful of innovative implementations from companies like Octoparts and Twilio, there are no solid API consumption resources that target the spreadsheet environment. Meaning there is no easy way for mainstream spreadsheet users to put common API driven resources to work for them within the spreadsheets that they live in daily--that is until today, with the launch of the&nbsp;Blockspring launched their Google Spreadsheets Add-On. Yeah I know, making APIs work in spreadsheets has been done for a while, via Google Spreadsheets and Excel Spreadsheets, but nobody has standardized it like Blockspring just did. So let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the implementation. I went to the Google Chrome App Store, and downloaded the add-on. &nbsp; &nbsp; Then using a new spreadsheet, I click on add-ons &gt; Blockspring, and logged...[<a href="/2015/04/02/blockspring-shifts-the-api-client-conversation-with-their-google-spreadsheet-api-addon/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 Apr 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I was introduced to StreamData.io the other day, by Gabriel Dillon (@gjdillon) of Readme.io. StreamData.io provides a caching, and push layer for apps to take advantage of, that can be deploy on top of existing APIs. I haven&rsquo;t implemented StreamData.io yet, I am still evaluating it, and at first glance it looks like an interesting new real-time layer, that you can use on top of APIs, to improve application performance and user experience.
I&rsquo;m going to add StreamData.io to my real-time research right now, however once I start playing with I may add as an API deployment resource as well. I have some verification to do, but I&rsquo;d love to test out the potential for StreamData.io to deliver cache and sync layer for common APIs, doing for APIs, what StreamData.io is doing for apps&mdash;delivering on one of my ongoing ideas for caching high use APIs.
When I was working in Washington DC, I had the pleasure of working during the federal government shutdown, where I wrote a piece asking if we can depend on our federal government APIs, and talked about caching APIs with AWS cloud formations, or Open Shift. My objective is to ensure there redundant sources for APIs coming out of government, providing developers with a more stable solution, they can depend on. I even added this thinking into the early APIs.json design, allowing you to define cached indexes of APIs.
I&rsquo;ve added StreamData.io to my real-time research, and I&rsquo;ll get in there and play with more, as I have the time. Then I&rsquo;ll get a better understanding of what you can do with the API caching and syncing, seeing if it is possible to deliver this layer for my APIs as well as my apps&mdash;something that is even more appealing in this age of Docker containers. #FoodForThought

			<p>I was reading Are You Or Your Customers Leaking Your API Keys? from Daryl Miller (@darrel_miller) the other day, which spurred me to float up a story in my Evernote, from a couple months back. My thoughts are only related to Daryll&rsquo;s because it is about API keys, and their accessibility&mdash;the similarities stop there. Daryl is talking about a very different layer of key management, which we should all be thinking deeply about. API key management is an API provider issue, as much as it is an API consumer issue. As an API provider I need to have an easy way to manage all the keys I provide to developers. As an API consumer, I need to have an easy to manage all the API keys I get across the API providers that I depend on. In short, key management isn&rsquo;t easy, and there are no clear solutions that serve both ends of the key management coin. As an API provider, I use 3Scale API Infrastructure to manage my API keys. Using my API portal, developers can sign up for their own accounts, manage their apps, and the keys that are issued. 3Scale does all the heavy lifting for me, all I have to do is manage my API service composition, and keep an eye on dev usage, as well as keep an eye on my own app usage. I use all my own APIs for my apps too! Sometimes my apps are the bad actors, it not always the developers who abuse API access.&nbsp; As an API consumer, I&rsquo;m working hard to pull my API key world together, using a home brew format I&rsquo;m calling simple api-keys. I&rsquo;m am using Github for all of my API and microservice related projects, so I&rsquo;m beginning to centralize how I store keys, and how I manage them across all my apps. With a central storage, and management process, I&rsquo;m hoping to get a better handle on which...[<a href="/2015/03/31/temp-api-keys-leave-them-laying-around-the-web-where-devs-will-find-them/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>This post is extracted from a deep dive I've been doing into the Swagger ecosystem, as part of regular conversations I have been having with Tony Tam (@fehguy), trying to understand how we can better tell stories about Swagger. I've been tuned into things for a while now around the Swagger community, and there is a lot going on, but from the outside, some of this can be hard to see. Seeking a better understand what is the Swagger community, I wanted to take a walk through the sites, forum, and Github repositories. First let&rsquo;s start with the basics, what is Swagger? Merriam Webster defines Swaggers as: : to walk in a very confident way : to walk with a swagger. ;-) Seriously though, Swagger is a machine readable format (either JSON or YAML), for describing an API, providing a description of API operations, in a way that other applications can read, and understand. Even though Swagger is machine readable, and designed for other applications, it has also become a language for humans to describe and collaborate, around a shared, quantifiable, vision of what an API can do, throughout all stages of the API life cycle.&nbsp; If you want to learn about Swagger yourself, you can tune into these channels to learn more: Website Twitter Github Google Group My goal with this post is evolve my understanding and awareness of what Swagger is, and hopefully along the way I can help increase yours as well. In my experience, many people have a very distorted, and limited understanding of what Swagger is, and I&rsquo;d like to take some time to evolve that. When I started this research, my objective was to help Tony deliver a new website, and on-boarding materials for Swagger, assisting people of all skill levels in finding all things Swagger.

			<p><em>30 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I've been tracking on the potential for voice APIs since Siri was first announced, a topic that often meant telephony like from Twilio, or audio transcription from Popup Archive and Clarify. When I close my eyes and think about the the future of APIs and voice enablement, it is more akin to the Siri example, where the digital world is (supposedly) just a voice command away.
Imagine making all your employee directory, company calendar, or product catalog available via voice commands. How do you do this? You do it with APIs, and a voice enablement platform in-between the application developers, and the available API resources. Much like all other voice enablement, I think we have a huge amount of work to get anywhere close to the pictures we all have in our head, when if comes to voice enablement.
It is my mission to find these signs across the API landscape, and keep an eye on what they are doing. One platform that is now open for beta is Amazon Echo. Amazon says, "Echo is designed around your voice. It's always on&mdash;just ask for information, music, news, weather, and more.&rdquo; APIs are how we will deliver on the &ldquo;more&rdquo; part of this equation. The difference between Apple Siri, and Amazon Echo at this point, is Amazon will let you (API providers) help deliver on the &ldquo;more&rdquo; part of Amazon Echo discovery equation.
I&rsquo;m signing up for the beta, and if I get access, I will share more stories. I encourage you to sign up as well, and if you have any work your doing with Amazon Echo, or know of other API driven voice-enablement platforms I should be paying attention to, let me know.

			<p><em>28 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I am evolving my own personal microservices definition, something that is constantly changing, as I work on my infrastructure, read other people&rsquo;s own definitions (no shortage these lately), and continuing having conversations with smart folks across the space. I had the pleasure of having Mike Amundsen over the other night for dinner, and after having some interesting discussions about community, and potential micro services design, I&rsquo;m adding a couple of elements to my microservice definition list.
In my last post&nbsp;on this, I listed seven criteria I congress as part of my micro services definition:

minimal surface
minimal on disk
minimal compute
minimal message
minimal network
minimal time to rebuild
minimal time to throw away

I wanted to add two elements to my list, considering some of the other elements I&rsquo;ve noticed at play when it comes to API bloat:

minimal ownership
minimal dependencies

Minimal owners is a pretty easy one for me, as I&rsquo;m the owner of all my microservices&mdash;the buck always stops with me. However, It is a good reminder to make sure all of my services have a vCard applied to their APIs.son file index. It is important to easily known who is responsible for any public or private API, and with APIs.son and Swagger, this is easy to do.
When it comes to minimal dependencies, this gets a little tougher for me. My world isn&rsquo;t too bad, because my systems are small, and I&rsquo;ve been the only developer.  The down side is I&rsquo;ve been the only developer, and I&rsquo;ve bee lazy about how many dependencies an API might have, and also been fairly sloppy about how I integrate with 3rd party APIs. Adding this item to my list will help me keep an eye on how I establish dependencies between services, keeping them minimal, and well documented.
That is it, I just wanted to add ownership and dependencies to my list of considerations&mdash;I just like making a production out of everything.

			<p><em>27 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>
There are many areas I track on as part of my research. Things that do not show up on my weekly API.Reports, or in my analysis on API Evangelist. One of these is the area of drones. I&rsquo;m fascinated by this potential area in the area of Internet of Things, but until now it was more of a side note, or one possible path for APIs and the Internet of Things.
Amongst the numerous drone stories I curate, I'm seeing more shift in the space towards a developer focus. It isn't just about the drone itself, its about customizing, developing and using the drone as a platform. One recent story I noticed was 3D Robotics (3DR), one of North America's largest consumer drone manufacturer, announcing the release of a new DroneKit, which includes an API for drone app development.
DroneKit has a web API defined using Swagger, which is the first Drone API I have actually added to my system. I am sure there are more out there, and now that I&rsquo;m tracking on closer, I'm sure I'll find them. The number of drone related stories that flow through my feeds is getting pretty out of control, and I'm thinking the space needs some standard approaches to APIs identified, to help develop better drone solutions, but also potentially inject some transparency into this growing layer of IoT.
 

Now that I have an API blueprint for a drone API, in Swagger too! ;-) I will be able to start thinking about what some of the API patterns for drones might look like, and what some of the common building blocks might be for managing the technical, but also business, and political side of drone operation. I&rsquo;m thinking that when it comes to drone operations, APIs might not just be a nice to have, they might be something that becomes mandatory in trying to bring this fast growing, not well defined space, under some control.

			<p><em>27 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>There was a quick post from Mashable the other day about a conversation with WhatsApp cofounder Brian Acton, called WhatsApp cofounder: Sorry developers, no API for you. Its pretty common argument you hear from business leaders, regarding why they won&rsquo;t open up APIs. It has been a while since I railed on this line of thinking, so I am taking the opportunity to share why this is such an un-informed, short-sighted view of APIs. I wasn&rsquo;t at the conference, so I a completely dependent on Mashable for this, but apparently someone in the audience asked: "We have done a lot of transactional messaging using traditional email and SMS, and we've recently moved into the international market," the engineer explained to the audience, who clapped and hollered. "We're desperate to communicate with our members where WhatsApp would be a wonderful platform. We're good developers." Acton stated that they had no current plans to, adding: "We don't want to inundate users with messages they don't want," Acton explained of the choice. "I am very empathetic to your cause. I receive emails on a regular basis from people who want to run their business or want to run something using WhatsApp as the backbone for communication, but we're balancing that with the user experience." Before I point out how narrow this thinking, let&rsquo;s focused on why I use the word un-informed to describe this perspective. Let&rsquo;s say the motivation for not opening up an API at WhatsApp is purely about UX, let&rsquo;s explore some of the options on the table, for API providers to strike the balance they are looking for in this area. API Management Service Composition With modern API management services, you have a critical concept called "service composition", where you the API provider, can carve up different levels of access to valuable API resources, deciding exactly who has access to what.

			<p><em>27 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>When I started API Evangelist, I was all about the Business of APIs, something I still focus on, but increasingly over the last couple years I am focusing more on what I call the politics of APIs. In my opinion, the politics of APIs can be anything from terms of service and privacy policies, to rate limits, pricing, and security, all the way up to court cases, patents, and government regulation. Today I want to focus on the very top of that spectrum&mdash;government regulation. The government isn't just getting into the API game, by deploying their own APIs, they are going to also increasingly be getting more involved with private sector APIs. In my weekly monitoring I'm seeing more chatter across several industries, like the UK treasury getting involved in banking API standards, and a push in the healthcare industry for more interoperability via APIs--just to highlight two recent stories. This isn&rsquo;t anything new, governments been defining API standards and pitching them to industries for a while now. I personally have been involved in healthcare and energy related standards, as part of Blue Button and Green Button data services. In coming years, what is going to increase, is the number of industries that the government is helping define standard, as well as beginning to get a little more heavy handed about mandating APIs as part of the regulatory process.. Personally I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of government regulation, something I feel gets abused on both sides of the tracks, but I understand it is a necessary actor when it comes to balance in markets. To help address some of the abuse that occurs, I think APIs could significantly help bring much needed transparency, and self-service access to the process, for both the public and private sector. I feel the conversation in coming years will move beyond the government just defining industry API standards, but also pushing for real-time interoperability, and execution by companies who operate...[<a href="/2015/03/27/politics-of-apis-talk-of-api-driven-regulation-is-increasing/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>After reflecting on API management and the Apigee IPO, I&rsquo;m thinking deeper on how the API space has come to be a &ldquo;thing". To kick off this story, you have to start with the API itself, something very abstract, hard to see, let alone convey to the average person. A single API is difficult to quantify, let alone an entire sector, or the companies rising up to service this perceived sector&mdash;think of the argument from early API management service providers like Mashery, 3Scale, and Apigee had to make to their VCs. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the API space has always been a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; to me, but along the road from 2010-2015, there has been plenty times, where I question the way things are. I have to give it to Mashery, they saw it early on, then 3Scale and Apigee joined in, and in 2015 we have a real industry, with 35 API management service providers, in addition to the expanding number of service providers catering to API design, deployment, management, discovery, integration, and other evolving layers of the API lifecycle. In 2015, I feel like the API sector is a real thing. Not because 3Scale is still growing, Mashery was acquired by Intel, Apigee is IPOing, or that there is over 35 API management service providers, including a number of open source solutions. The API sector is a real thing because there are many other companies, in many supporting area who have emerged, and the overall awareness around the potential of API, by business leaders has grown significantly. How did this happen? It happened because people were telling the story of APIs, whether it was marketing for their products services, or stories on ProgrammableWeb and API Evangelist&mdash;working in concert to create an industry (something). Within the same thought, I try to grasp how it was that I created API Evangelist. There sure as hell wasn&rsquo;t any strategy to do it.

			<p>The news came out yesterday that SmartBear was taking over ownership of Swagger, from Reverb. Swagger has been outgrowing its home at Reverb for some time now, becoming much more than I think even Tony originally imagined. You can find the official announcement from SmartBear on their site, and Tony&rsquo;s thoughts over on the Reverb blog. No need for me to recap, but I did want to provide some of my personal thoughts on the shift in this very important project. I feel like we are embarking on the next stage in the evolution of Swagger. Over the last couple of years, the Swagger community has see growth, adoption, and investment at an unprecedented pace, culminating in version 2.0 of the spec and now its transfer SmartBear. The scope and passion of the Swagger community and the investment that Tony Tam specifically and also the API community have made -- these have all brought us to this moment. I've known the SmartBear team for years, and after speaking with them about this transition of the Swagger specification, I believe SmartBear is the right steward for Swagger, during its next stage of its evolution. SmartBear understands the gravity of what they are now taking charge of: the Swagger specification representing a central truth throughout the entire API lifecycle. SmartBear fully understands too that it was organic growth that made Swagger the force that it has become, and SmartBear is aware that a unique balance of leadership, open governance, and a strong community pull will be just as essential during the next stage of growth. I look forward to working with the Swagger community and SmartBear team to ensure Swagger continues playing a vital role across the API space, meeting the demands of the fast-growing API economy. As I mentioned, I see Swagger as a central truth in the API economy, something I&rsquo;m invested in beyond just my own IT infrastructure, as Swagger is also the cornerstone...[<a href="/2015/03/26/swagger-shifts-hands-from-reverb-to-smartbear/">Read More</a>]</p>

I have met most of the API management providers, and after 5 years of covering them, it is no secret I have my favorites (you know who you are ;-). The business side of being an API management service provider has never really excited me, so I tend to stay away from the investment and acquisition stories, or speculating to much on who is winning the cash game. With that said, I think the Apigee IPO is a pretty significant milestone for the industry, something I have to give pause to, and reflect on how far we&rsquo;ve come, and evaluate how an IPO compares to the acquisitions we&rsquo;ve seen in recent years, or the other significant industry milestones. The acquisitions of Mashery, Layer7, Vordel, and Apiphany showed the space was really maturing, and the recent name change by SOA Software to Akana, shows the space has evolved over the last ten years. I think the Apigee IPO shows the overall space is actually growing up. I don&rsquo;t think Apigee had many other alternatives, with a gagillion dollars in funding, but I still think still it shows the space is moving out of its juvenile phase. I guess the actual IPO will be the true test of how grown up we all actually are eh? For me, another thing to note is where 3Scale is at. You see, I consider Mashery, 3Scale, and Apigee to be the OG three of API management service providers. Yeah, I know you have been...[<a href="/2015/03/24/reflecting-on-api-management-and-the-apigee-ipo/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>I was listening to too infrequent Traffic and Weather API podcast today, and one of the topics John and Steve covered was an interesting approach to API consumption, and getting past API rate limits, with WebhookDB. I agree with John, that WebhookDB is pretty clever, and represents what I'd consider classic API developer ingenuity, when it comes to getting access to the resources they need. I&rsquo;d have to give this one to my friend and API adversary Tyler Singletary (@harmophone), when he says rate limits stimulate developer creativity. +1 Tyler. So, what does WebhookDB do? ...allows you to replicate Github's database over HTTP using webhooks. It's useful if you want to treat Github's APIs as a database, querying over pull requests and issues. Github doesn't like that, and you'll quickly hit the API's rate limits -- but if you use WebhookDB, you don't have to worry about it! Just populate the initial data into the database, set up the webhook replication to keep it in sync, and query your local database however you'd like... There is more back-story over at the REST API gotcha, and webhookdb story that Traffic and Weather linked to. I agree with John&rsquo;s thoughts, that this is an opportunity for a service provider to step up and deliver on. I envision a pretty simple, open source, containerized version, as well as a cloud-based version that people could tap into, and pay for more premium services on top of each index. John is right, there will be significant overhead in defining the schema of each API you would support. Let me know, I can help with some of the targeting, alongside what I&rsquo;m doing for my API Stack. Each API would need some special attention, but with containers, you could easily build out a pretty slick deployment solution that runs in cloud, or in infrastructure of choice for end-users. With some heavy lifting up front, it would be a pretty viable solution...[<a href="/2015/03/20/overcoming-api-rate-limits-like-they-did-with-webhookdb/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>I'm slowly migrating my own infrastructure, towards a microservice first approach, something you can follow the details of on my alpha.apievangelist.com blog. I've been running on my own custom brew content management system (CMS) since I started API Evangelist in 2010. There are many APIs in use across my system, both external publicly available APIs like Twitter and Crunchbase, and a wide variety of internal APIs I've developed myself. As I work to replicate each aspect of my CMS, carving off each potential micro service, I'm reminded of how much of what I do lives in the shadows. Little scripts I've written here, and there, jobs I haven't run in months, and just general code exhaust from years of operation. I&rsquo;m a little different than most shops, as I'm a one person operation, who codes all my own stuff, but based upon my experience in other shops, the same behavior exists in almost any organization. Throughout this migration I&rsquo;m reminded of what I'd consider to be one of the biggest security lapses in my world, which is just about things being known. As I build out new features, jobs, bells, and whistles, are they all cataloged, mapped out, and consistently used, or deprecated. Anything that is unknown, unaccounted for, lives in the shadows of my operations, and potentially provides a security risk. Often times the culprit in any security lapse, is an unknown workstation, server, application, or single script. Having a single doorway (micro service), with a single approach to authentication (3Scale API Infrastructure), and a map of my entire surface area, using Swagger + APIs.json, I&rsquo;m getting a much better handle on things. It will take a while to clean up all my legacy stuff, and map everything out, but once I do, I can easily audit, monitor, deprecate, and ultimately secure the entire surface area of my infrastructure, because it is all done with an API first approach. Then I&rsquo;ll continue to address...[<a href="/2015/03/20/bringing-my-it-infrastructure-out-of-the-shadows-with-an-apifirst-approach/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am putting a lot of thought into the value of an API request and response lately. I've talked about the potential of a Postman collection as a unit of measurement, for the API economy. I&rsquo;m also spending time breaking down the monetization strategies of the 700+ companies I track on, but I&rsquo;m really looking to get beyond just the API pricing, and actually measure any evidence of real value that I can. This particular post is born out of a conversation with John Sheehan (@johnsheehan), CEO of Runscope, while we were in Sydney Australia last month for API Days Sydney. John had mentioned that when people asked him which are the best APIs out there, he replies &ldquo;none of them, until they are used&rdquo;. Which when you think about it, it really is the truth--APIs do not offer ay value, until they are actually put to use in an app, or system integration. It is easy to place the value in the actual API definition, or in the request, or response from the API. There is also a lot of talk about much of the value being in the documentation, or possibly the SDK. You can event point to the value being that it is a public API, with easy on-boarding, that you can rely on, and scale as you need. All of this may contribute units to the overall value, but at this point any API still doesn't have value to anyone. As John says, the point at which an API has value, is when it is used. Until that point, an API isn&rsquo;t a thing. I&rsquo;m not saying the API call as a metric, is the single metric to rule them all, but it is at this point when I feel you can really begin to measure the value an API delivers, and capture the exhaust from it. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know what I mean by all of this, it really is...[<a href="/2015/03/20/an-api-has-no-value-until-it-is-actually-used/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I'm working with multiple partners to define what I&rsquo;d consider to be the firsts stops along the API lifecycle, when you use APIs.json as the scaffolding for your API operations. APIs.json is a machine readable format for indexing APIs, that exist under a specific website domain, or are part of a aggregate collection designed for a specific project or objective. To help me, and the folks I&rsquo;m working with to better see the API lifecycle that APIs.json is enabling, I wanted to take a stroll through each of the stops along the API lifecycle, and think through the potential for additional formats, services, and tooling throughout the entire journey. I want to explore the possibilities for individual API providers, API consumers, as well as API service providers, and the aggregate level, where companies and individuals are delivering valuable tools and services to the overall space. First, lets start with what I envision APIs.json enabling at the direct one to one, API provider and consumer levels: API Metadata - Quick access to the most important info about any API, its title, description, image, endpoint, url and tags. API Surface Area - (The Truth) - Using Swagger and API Blueprint, any developer can quickly quantify the surface area of an API or microservice. Execute API - Include Postman Collections, allowing each API to be execute ready, allowing consumers to load in Postman and deliver the value behind any API. On-Board API - One click reference to where an API consumer can onboard with an API. Existing Server-Side Code - Locating of existing server-side code in multiple languages. Auto Generate Server-Side Code - Locating of services for generating of server-side code in multiple languages. Supporting Container Images - Where Docker, and other container images reside, providing instant deployment opportunities. Existing Client Side Code - Locating of existing client-side code in multiple languages.

I was just talking with my friend Oliver Seiler (@0seiler) in New Zealand via email. Oliver is great at keeping me in tune with API related stories out of New Zealand. I was making sure he knew how much I appreciate people like him sending me regular updates, and that it is what makes API Evangelist go around&mdash;to which he replied, reminding of how important the work we are doing here in the US API space.
Oliver told me what I hear a lot, "We still need to sell our story every single day and you wouldn't believe how much anything that comes from particularly you and 18F, but also ProgrammableWeb and GDS in the UK matters to our work." This isn't an isolated case, I hear this a lot from people I talk to in government, enterprises, and other institutions around then globe--the stories we tell are used to make change in how they think and potentially operate. Our stories from the trenches, become the stories they use to sell APis to their bosses.&nbsp;
These reminders are what keeps me going after almost five years of evangelizing. The stories we are sharing about API best practices, and the challenges we face across API design, deployment, management, monetization, evangelism, discovery, and integration, are important to not just the health of the overall API space, but to each public and private sectors that APIs are touching in 2015.
The message for me here, is that we all need to keep pushing forward, but also making sure we tell the stories publicly, sharing our knowledge in real-time, because people are watching, and depending on us to help influence how things work in their businesses, institutions, and government agencies around the world. #NoPressure

			<p><em>17 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>Running the perfect API operation is pretty much a delusional dream. Even leaders &nbsp;like Twilio and AWS have platform, and ecosystem produced problems on a regular basis. In my opinion, API are all about the journey, and we may never get our strategy 100% perfect, we can communicate, and evolve along the way&mdash;this is what I consider the API journey. To help demonstrate this in action, here a post from the GSA, about the SAM API, on the US Government API Forum: We've, rightfully, heard complaints about the SAM API languishing and the documentation not being as functional as it needs to be. We want to make sure users of the API feel comfortable using it to build real applications off of. We've adjusted how we're staffing the API as well as raised the priority the API in the eyes of our developers. To you, this means this:&nbsp; 1) At a minimum, we're sweeping through new GitHub issues weekly, but we will do everything to go through those issues more rapidly.2) We're going to increase our transparency by making sure that anything in our backlog that's API-related is in a GitHub issue - if it's prioritized with a date, that'll be made clear, too. We want to make sure you know what's coming and on what days - and the docs will be updated to reflect what's currently implemented and what's coming.3) We're going to publish our version management plan to the SAM API site so it's more clear what's going to cause a version change. One of the things about the SAM data is that regulations may change our data, so we should be treating some of it (like reps and certs) as variable-length instead of fixed to keep systems from breaking, so we absolutely document that. We've already added some updates that include reference data that wasn't available before and a few minor cleanups. Expect the more as we ramp up our people...[<a href="/2015/03/17/the-api-journey-we-do-not-always-get-our-api-strategy-100-perfect-but-we-can-communicate-learn-and-evolve/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>Like API, the term microservice has emerged as a force, along with a meaning that is very precise, or very broad, depending on who you are. The only thing I&rsquo;m sure of at this point, is the term microservice is very personal, and means very different things to different people, depending on where you stand in the industry. Regardless I can't help but consider the implications of the term, internalize it, and see what value I can derive from its meaning in my own world. This exercise leaves me asking, what is a microservice? Over and over, acknowledging I may never fully know the meaning, and like API it will be more of a journey, then it never will be a destination. First and foremost in my world a microservice means simple, and small. Simple and small. Simple and small. Say it until you can feel it, all Buddhist colliding with API Evangelist. Simple and small, penetrates all layer of meaning for me. minimal surface minimal on disk minimal compute minimal message minimal network minimal ui minimal time to rebuild minimal time to throw away Ultimately I want all of this, coupled with the ability to achieve maximum scale, with minimum effort. I want to do one thing, as well as I possibly can, with as minimal resources necessary, but delivering the maximum value at any scale&mdash;with value benefiting myself, my API consumers, and the end-users being served, equally. None of this is set in stone for me. I acknowledge this is my own perception, and that others will see microservices as something entirely different. Even so, I share my definition publicly, as also I enjoy reading others definition. I kind of think that is part of the whole microservices thing, sharing your own personal definition. In reality microservices do not change my API mission, but it does allow the conversation to be distilled down, for a new generation of business leaders working to make...[<a href="/2015/03/17/more-pondering-on-my-own-microservice-definition/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I would say the enterprise space fleet has successfully shifted their course, heading in the general direction of everything API. SAP, Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, and the rest of the usual suspects have pledged their faith to APIs, mobile, and IoT, all in a very public way. For those of us who jumped off the SOA bandwagon a while back (getting on the API bandwagon, yeehaw), this can be amusing to watch, cause the API bandwagon is better y'know?. ;-) I sincerely hope that these large companies can make a shift towards an API way of life, or a microservice devops way of operating, or whatever the cool enterprise kids are calling it these days. Some companies will find success in these areas, while many, many others will just talk about it, and buy a wide range of vendor services that will help them talk about it&mdash;there will be a lot of money to be made (and spent). The thing I fear, is that many of the core principles of why this whole thing is working will go right over the heads of many technologies and business leaders in the enterprise. Elements like simplicity, transparency, openness, and functioning in a decoupled, decentralized way. You are the enterprise, many of the essential ingredients of API, are just fundamentally at odds with what you are. You are a big, complex, powerful, and political corporate presence&mdash;a beast that does not like being taken apart, reinvented over and over, and being forced to work in concert with other internal, partner, and public resources, in an open way. This doesn't mean that some enterprise entities won&rsquo;t be successful&mdash;some will. I will be carefully watching the waves of enterprise organizations, for these tech savvy few, who internalize the core philosophy around APIs, successfully uploading their corporate soul to the API singularity. However, I predict I will have to work very hard to find these companies amidst the wreckage of the enterprise organizations...[<a href="/2015/03/13/the-enterprise-will-make-the-same-mistakes-with-api-and-microservices-that-they-did-with-soa-because-essential-api-concepts-go-right-over-their-head/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I'm immersed in deep thoughts about the implications of machine readable API definitions like APIs.json, Swagger, and Postman Collections, which are being applied to APIs, in some very different, but overlapping, and complementary ways. Currently I&rsquo;m working to define the overlap between APIs.json and Postman Collections, and how they work together.
For me, any good API starts with a Swagger definition, or API Blueprint, which is the single, machine readable truth of what is the surface area of any API, which I consider fingerprint for what is possible with any API or micro service. Additionally when I am working with any API, or stack of APIs, I am using APis.json to organize them into a single coherent set of APIs, then rely on each APIs properties to point to essential resources like Swagger, terms of service, pricing, and anything else I feel is essential to operations.
In addition to providing links to Swagger definitions for each APIs.json API entry, I&rsquo;m also experimenting with adding a property that point to any Postman Collection for each API, and microservice.  I&rsquo;ll start by just calling the type &ldquo;x-postman-collection&rdquo;, and provide a URL to a Postman Collection I&rsquo;ve generated around the API call, providing a link between what an API is, and a measurement of the transaction an API produces.
I&rsquo;d say that Swagger is the promise of value an API delivers, and Postman is a machine readable representation of the value, ready for execution&mdash;which acts as machine readable unit you can then load into Postman, or any other system, and actually experience the result. When this unit is sitting in your Postman client, you can see the value behind a single collection, but when you see a couple hundred of these collections in your Postman, you start seeing the important role they can play in the overall API economy, as portable a unit of measurement for API transactions.

			<p>If you are following some of my recent stories, I&rsquo;m heavily focused on APIs.json, as I work to organize my own stack of microservices, using APIs.son and Swagger. I&rsquo;m working hard to define additional, machine readable layers to my microservices index that answer as many of the questions that I have about the microservices and APIs that I depend on. The first machine readable definition I include in any APIs.json collection I&rsquo;m building is Swagger, which provides a JSON or YAML definition of the surface area for any microservice or API that I depend on. The second thing I put to work for my own APIs, is API Commons, which provides a JSON definition for the licensing of my APIs. Beyond that I&rsquo;m pushing forward a couple of other machine readable definitions, that help me make sense of not just a handful of APIs in my own collections, but potentially thousands of APIs in the public space. I just published two potential new machine readable definitions to add to my stack of APIs.json properties: api-pricing - My quest to understand the API pricing across the API space, from providers like Amazon to Twilio, there are some healthy patterns to follow when crafting API pricing. api-questions - My realization that nobody would give a shit about a machine readable terms of service, so I created a simple JSON list of questions and answers that can be applied to APIs. These are two areas that I am trying to better understand, as I build my machine readable index of the APIs, that I call the API Stack, which also helps fuel APIs.io. Another area I&rsquo;m struggling to get a handle on, is the message layer around APIs, and more widely what I&rsquo;d consider the feedback look around APIs. So, what the heck do I mean by this? I&rsquo;m not entirely sure, I&rsquo;m still trying to figure it out in real-time--which is why I'm writing this post.&nbsp; If...[<a href="/2015/03/13/making-the-api-feedback-loop-machine-readable-with-apis-json/">Read More</a>]</p>

I've said it before, and I will say it again &mdash; Excel and spreadsheets&nbsp;will continue to be super critical for the growth of the API industry. There are an increasing number of solutions like APISpark for deploying and managing APIs using spreadsheets, something that will get easier over time, but so far I'm not seeing equal acknowledgment of the potential of Microsoft Excel as an API client.
The majority of the world's data is locked up in spreadsheets, and CSV files. Something I learned during my short time in Washington DC, is that the API community is going to have to court the legions of data stewards who spend their days in spreadsheets at the companies, and government agencies around the world, if we are going to be successful. The tooling for deploying APIs from spreadsheets has emerged, but we have a lot of work ahead to make them simpler and easier to use.
With the majority of the worlds data locked up in spreadsheets, this also means many of the business decision makers have their head in the spreadsheet on a daily basis, depending on the data, calculations, and visualizations that influence their daily decision-making. I&rsquo;m seeing only light efforts around delivering API driven services in the spreadsheet, something that is going to have to grow significantly before the API industry can reach the scale we would like.
I know that the spreadsheet does not excite API providers, and API integrators, but they are a comfortable tool for many of the business ranks, and if we are going to get them to buy into API economy, and play nicely, we are going to have to accommodate their world. When thinking of spreadsheets and APIs, don't just think delivering content and data to APIs, but also how APIs can deliver vital content and data back to spreadsheets users&mdash;acknowledging the ubiquitous tool can provide huge benefits as an API client, as well as data source.

			<p><em>12 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>I use many types of APIs. Some are public APIs, operated by other people, and then there are the APIs I have designed, operate, and consume on my own. As I design, redesign, deploy, and manage my APIs, I'm in a fortunate place that I get to push the boundaries of API operations, without much of the friction of normal API platforms. I'm the only one providing and consuming many of my APIs, essentially running an API dictatorship. Over time I have built quite a few APIs that are still up, active, but nobody is using them. I have built them during some specific research, or to support a prototype, which once I was done with core work, I do not need the API to actually be alive and running. At some point in the future when I revisit the research, I may want to fire back up the APIs, but for now its ok if they are down, with a dormant Docker image, and server-side code living within its requisite Github repo. This is just one example of how I&rsquo;m building APIs that could possibly go away at anytime. It is an area that, as I think about more, the more use cases I come up with. It is helping me rethink some of my architecture, and workflow. Another potential approach I am contemplating involves having a single UI that may use one or many APIs, but those APIs aren't even live until I load the screen&mdash;which triggers the containerized deployment of the last known snapshot of each of the dependent microservices. If nothing else I&rsquo;m having fun. I&rsquo;m not sure if all these scenarios are viable in the real world, but it makes for an interesting exercise, and provides me with a kind of fire drill approach to my workflow that lets me rethink my APIs, and the workflow around them, with each drill. For me, it shines a whole new light on...[<a href="/2015/03/12/transitory-apis-intentionally-building-apis-that-can-go-away-at-anytime/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>12 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I was listening the APIsâUncensored podcast last weekend, where Ole Lensmar (@olensmar), and Lorinda Brandon (@lindybrandon) sat down for a conversation with Tony Tam (@fehguy), the creator of API definition format Swagger. There are a lot of interesting API informational nuggets throughout the podcast, some of which I'll be writing about, but this one is about something Tony mentioned&mdash;called Swagger vendor extensions.
I've been using Swagger for a while, and specifically Swagger 2.0 since its release, and Swagger vendor extensions was new thing to me&mdash;most likly user error. I don't ever sweat things I miss, because I consume so much information each day, things are bound to get past me. Anyways, Swagger vendor extensions are simply the ability to add any property to an API definition by using the &ldquo;x-&ldquo; prefix&rdquo;.
This is something we do with APIs.json as well, and is something that I think becomes the R&amp;D layer for any specification. Since I just learned about this ability, I do not have many examples of what has been done with these extensions. I found a post from Apigee demonstrating how you can add "capabilities such as caching, quota, OAuth, and analytics to your API with Swagger vendor extensions via a project we call Volos.js&rdquo;, and I came across Wikimedia using a "x-subspecs&rdquo; in the API definition for Wikipedia&mdash;now that I&rsquo;m tracking on Swagger vendor extensions I will look for them in Swagger specs I come across.
I've come across blog posts about Swagger, where people outline how they don&rsquo;t use it because they can&rsquo;t define something they want. Maybe they just didn't know about Swagger vendor extensions like me, IDK. Regardless I will be tracking on how people are extending Swagger using the vendor extensions, and begin brainstorming some of my own ideas on how they can be used to craft exactly the API definition you need.

			<p>I am revisiting some work that I started when I was working in Washington DC as a Presidential Innovation Fellow(PIF). Actually there are several things going on here, a sort of perfect storm of API design thoughts. After reviewing hundreds of APIs, including APIs in the federal government, you start to want to either go mad, or start making changes to the API designs you are exposed to. This leads me to the other layer to this story, a common question I get regularly, regarding whether or not there are any write APIs in the federal government&mdash;meaning, can you POST, or PUT to a common government resources. Write APIs are important in government, and their scarcity reflect some of the systemic illnesses I feel exists in government IT. With that in mind, bundled with the regular process of reviewing an API implementation out of government&mdash;you get this late night API Evangelist story. Enjoy. ;-) I was profiling the data.usajobs.gov jobs API, which included crafting a machine readable Swagger API definition: After crafting this machine readable definition of the surface area of data.usajobs.gov, I am once again reminded of the lack of write APIs in government--as the data.usajobs.gov API is GET only, which only provides a single search endpoint. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I am thankful for the work they&rsquo;ve done with the data.usajobs.gov jobs API, it is just my nature to study, then push and iterate on API designs anywhere I possibly can. Sorry, I have an addiction. ;-( As I was profiling data.usajobs.gov, I remembered of the work I did as a PIF in DC, and how after the government shutdown, I wanted to see more APIs, have an augmented layer to their operations&mdash;eliminating the ability to turn off the switch for government APIs. Meaning I would like read only APIs like data.usajobs.gov to have one or many other APIs that sync, and augment API functionality, beyond what the original government agency intended.

I came across an interesting piece of technology today while doing new curation for API.Report. RASON,&nbsp;an interesting approach to API driven analytics and potential UI and visualization, that kind of resembles what I have been envisioning for one possible future. The analytics tool is created by a company called Frontline Systems, and I&rsquo;ll let them articulate what it is:
RASON&trade; software is designed to make it much easier to create, test and deploy analytic models that use optimization, simulation, and data mining. RASON stands for Restful Analytic Solver&trade; Object Notation.
RASON targets analytical professionals, excel power users, and web app developers, but here is where it gets over my head, "Problems you can solve with the RASON service include linear programming and mixed-integer programming problems, quadratic programming and second-order cone problems, nonlinear and global optimization problems, problems requiring genetic algorithm and tabu search methods -- from small to very large." &mdash; sounds impressive to me!
I signed up and played with RASON a little bit, but it wasn't as intuitive as I hoped. I think I have a little more to learn about RASON. The RASON models are very cool, I like the airport hub, I just don&rsquo;t have enough knowledge to make it work right now, however I&rsquo;m digging the idea, and it reflects what I&rsquo;ve been seeing in my head when it comes to defining API driven analysis--when you connecting that with API generated visualizations, hypermedia, spreadsheets, APIs.son, and more&mdash;I start to get a little too excited.
Anyhoo. Just sharing a new technology that I found. Once I learn more about RASON, hopefully I will be able to see where RASON fits into the bigger API life-cycle, and share a little more.

			<p><em>10 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>I was watching an open thread around ALPS over at API Craft, something that is on my working list to better understand, apply more in my world, and tell the story all along the way. ALPS author, and API visionary (;-) Mike Amundsen (@mamund) responded to the thread with a nice overview, which I wantd to repost and share with you. So, what is ALPS? ALPS is not a runtime format like HTML or HAL ALPS is not a designtime format like RAML or Swagger ALPS is a Profile format for describing the bounded context of a service. ALPS can be used as source material for designtime formats like RAML, WADL, Swagger, WSDL, etc. on the server side. ALPS can also be used as source material for client-side frameworks like Ember.js, Angular, etc on the client side. ALPS describes the operations (actions) and data elements of a service. that's all. that description is the same no matter the designtime tooling, protocol, or message format used. that description is the same whether you are implementing code on the client-side or server-side. "Hence state is maintained SERVER SIDE by mapping the URL's when it is implemented... correct?" ALPS has nothing to say about how or where state is maintained. You can do whatever you wish when you implement the bounded context ALPS describes. ALPS tells you the WHAT of the service, not the HOW. For example, you can use the ALPS document to implement a services that employs your API Chaining on the server side. Or you can use the same ALPS document to implement a classic hypermedia-driven service using Cj or some other hypermedia-rich format. You can also use the same ALPS document to implement a simple JSON-object CRUD-style service. When you use ALPS as the "shared bounded context" you can be confident that each of the services, regardless of their local implementation choices are supporting the same bounded context. this is especially handy when you...[<a href="/2015/03/10/what-is-alps/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>There are lots of good visualization stories recently, or maybe I&rsquo;m more focused on API driven visualizations. Who knows? This particular post is an API story because Mohiomap, the company at the center is using APIs to accomplish their &ldquo;vision&rdquo;, not because they have an API&mdash;which actually would be a nice way to pay it forward, but that is another story. Regardless, I think what Mohiomap is up to, is interesting on a lot of levels, bur primarily because in coming years we need to be able to better understand this new, cloud-based world we are creating for ourselves. Why am I blogging about this? Because Mohiomap is driven with APIs, and if done right, it can make a big difference in how we see our virtual selves, whether the business or brand personas we are crafting online, or our personal self that is spread across Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, and other API driven platforms. We currently can easily see our personas within each silo, like Facebook profile, Twitter profile, or Github profile, but understanding ourselves across the places we frequent online is much more difficult&mdash;something only possible when you begin using APIs. I&rsquo;ve had a visualization research project on my radar for some time now, but I think its time that I start publishing it for everyone to enjoy. API driven visualization is an important layer to my overall API economy research, and whether its for the meta layer of APIs, or for the valuable resources they are serving up, like wall posts, messages, photos, videos, or business documents--visualizations will continue to drive how we evolve our understanding of the digital world that is unfolding at a breakneck speed. With the addition of Mohiomap, I&rsquo;m starting to develop quite a list of API driven visualization services and tooling. Enough to warrant its own research area, and be given a certain amount of attention each week.

			<p>As I look through more APIs, and I don&rsquo;t just play around in their developer portal, and look at documentation, I am actually get my hands dirty generating Swagger definitions, and authenticating and making calls to an API. There is no better way to get to know an API, that generating a Swagger definition, and integrating with it&mdash;something when done, you always walk away with a new perspective. Once I get more of the APIs profiled in my API Stack, I&rsquo;m going to see if I can configure my API editor to let me iterate on other people&rsquo;s API designs a little bit. As an API consumer, you don&rsquo;t always get a voice in the design of the next version of an API, but with API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint, you can actually make edits, and then share them back with a provider. Of course it is still up to a provider to decide on what they accept, but there is not better way to make suggestions than a machine readable API definition, that is ready to go. When I get around to doing some housecleaning on these API designs I generated, and possibly make some design iterations, I&rsquo;ll focus on some of the smaller operations, leaving the bigger teams to do their own heavy lifting. Also, my goal isn&rsquo;t just to iterate on API designs to help the original provider improve on their design, my goal is to iterative and improve on the API designs in my stack. The more designs I play with, more designs I have in my library, and the more I get a feel for what I think API designs could, or should look like. I can&rsquo;t fix all the APIs in the world, but I can improve on the hard work that has already occurred, and who knows, maybe some providers will see it for the compliment that it is, and listen to some of my API...[<a href="/2015/03/10/targeting-some-apis-in-my-stack-for-house-cleaning-and-maybe-some-design-iterations/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>While processing the news today over at API.Report, I came across a story about Broadcom delivering an API for managing their latest network infrastructure. The intersection of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Application Programming Interface (API) is something I&rsquo;m paying closer attention to lately. Hmmm. SDN + API = Brand New Bullshit Acronym? Meh. Onward, I just can&rsquo;t slow down to care--{"packet keep moving"}. At the networking level, I&rsquo;m hearing Broadcom making a classic API infrastructure argument, "With the OpenNSL software platform, Broadcom is publishing APIs that map Broadcom's Software Development Kit (SDK) to an open north bound interface, enabling the integration of new applications and the ability to optimize switch hardware platforms.&rdquo;, with examples of what you could build including "network monitoring, load balancing, service chaining, workload optimization and traffic engineering." This new API driven approach to networking is available in the Broadcom Tomahawk and Trident II switches, looking to build up a developer community who can help deliver networking solutions, with Broadcom interested in giving, "users the freedom to control their technology, share their designs and boost application innovation.&rdquo; Everything Broadcom is up to is in alignment with other valid Internet of Things (IoT) efforts I&rsquo;m seeing across not just the networking arena, but almost any other physical object being connected to the Internet in 2015. I think what Broadcom is doing, is very forward leaning effort, and providing native API support at the device level is definitely how you support &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; around your networking infrastructure. To keep in sync with the leading edge of the current API evolution as I'm seeing it, I would also recommend adding virtualized container support at the device level. As a developer I am thankful for the APIs that you are exposing, allowing me to develop custom solutions using your hardware, but I need you to take it one level further--I need to be able to deploy my own APIs using Docker, as well as working with...[<a href="/2015/03/10/broadcom-i-am-going-to-need-your-switches-to-support-virtualized-containers-so-i-can-deploy-my-own-apis-too/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I'm a big fan of private APIs, and all for keeping API access tailored to meaningful groups of users vs. just opening up data to the public, without first thinking critically about the possible pros and cons. With that said, I always encourage API providers to seriously consider the outside-in effect, when APIs are designed to be as accessible as possible, allowing unintended things to occur around your API resources. It isn't just about the developers who are directly working with your API, it is also the entire API industry, and service providers that serve it. A number of companies exist across the API space, providing valuable products, services, and tooling that is derived from one or many API platforms. The API space is big enough now, it isn't just about the handful of strongest players, it is about the entire community. An example of this is with API ChangeLog, a monitoring service for API documentation. The API ChangeLog keeps an eye on 68 of the leading APIs, and tracks on whether or not they have updated their API documentation, and keeps developers informed of the changes. These types of services benefit both API providers, and consumers, making for a healthier space overall. While some API provider are good at keeping developers in tune with documentation changes, not all of us are able keep up, and sometimes developers just aren't tuned in, and the API ChangeLog helps fill in the gaps. Without outside access to API resources (like your docs), services like API ChangeLog do not exist, leaving developers to fend for themselves, and not providing valuable industry data that can be used by anyone. Services like API ChangeLog will be the lifeblood of the API economy, and provide valuable exhaust that informs API driven markets as they grow, and help give these markets som e of the positive forces they are so well known for.

A short, concise, portable description of what your API does, is one of the most critical building blocks of API management, and is essential to reducing friction when new users are on-boarding with any API. It can be easy to design, and populate your API developer portal from a perspective that is very much in the know. I do it all the time, structuring your portal to reach the widest possible audience can be hard&mdash;it is why I&rsquo;m here! ;-)
Here is a great example of providing all the right elements, but leaving out the essential detail that new API consumers will need. View the Dailymotion developer area, land on home page, and without clicking, tell me what Dailymotion does.

&nbsp;
The portal has all the right moves, except it neglects to say anything about videos, or show a video picture. I guess you could argue that anyone landing here will probably be getting there via the main Dailymotion site, with the proper knowledge of what is going on. This is probably true, but there will always be people landing on the API developer portal page, without any clue of what Dailymotion does&mdash;do not make them click to find out.
This really isn&rsquo;t that big of a mistake, and something that only someone like me, who looks at numerous developer portals would think about. For Dailymotion, all they have to do is update the FMA area, put video in the title, short description, and maybe include as an image in the background. Boom, within seconds everyone understands the value offered by Dailymotion in 2 seconds or less.
The description you provide on your API portal landing page is your first impression, make it count. It is also likely, that the press, bloggers, and  other 3rd parties will copy / paste the description to describe what you do, on remote websites&mdash;so make it good!

			<p>Tony Hirst (@psychemedia) wrote an interesting story about what I would consider the API journey, which he called, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s The Point Of An API?&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m the first to call bullshit on the term API, which is more storytelling magic than it ever was technical, for me. In my opinion, the point of an API is rarely ever the actual technical implementation&mdash;sorry devs. ;-( The point of the API is the journey, for the API provider, and the API consumer (both dev and end-user). The point of the API is about the API provider reducing friction, when it comes to understanding, and put to work, valuable digital assets from data, content, to more programmatic, algorithmic elements like image filtering or video encoding, to more physical elements like a Nest thermostat, webcam access, or drone controls. An API does not automatically equal success, it take so much more than just launching an API to establish something that delivers value, and is sustainable--something that can be easier said than done, in todays volatile, digital environment. The point of an API is about the API consumers having the freedom to discover, access, explore, and put to use valuable digital resources that they couldn&rsquo;t deliver on their own, in new and interesting ways. Developers need to be part of a feedback loop with API providers that helps iterate APIs, and evolve APIs towards being more experience based beyond their resource oriented roots, and integrate them in meaningful ways into the systems, apps, and devices end-users depend on the most. The point of an API is about empowering the end-user with applications that deliver value, all while opening up as much of the backend, and the pipes that are delivering valuable API driven resources, giving end-users a voice throughout the supply chain, using open formats like oAuth&mdash;bringing much needed transparency to the process.

			<p>I'm adding a new layer to my monitoring of the API space, what I consider to be the people layer of the API Evangelist network--the actual people who are executing on much of what I talk about, across my research, and storytelling. This is all born out of the network of people I already talk to regularly, to get the stories, and details for the research that I publish regularly. I have been tracking on many of the doers of the space for a while, behind the scenes, and this is just about exposing a select handful of individuals who can help you with some of the areas I discuss in my research and storytelling. Up until now, my research has been about showcasing: News Companies Tools All I&rsquo;m doing now is exposing some of the people who are doing interesting things as well, and are open to being contacted about their work, and discuss how you can potentially tap their expertise to help you achieve your API objectives. Over the next couple weeks, you will see me start listing individuals who are open to helping out in the core areas I research: API Design API Deployment API Management API Discovery API Integration API Evangelism API Monetization API Security I already showcase companies in many of these areas, and track on the features, or building blocks employed to deliver products and services they offer, all I&rsquo;m going to do now is provide more information on individuals who can help execute in these areas as well. Along the way you will also find me showcasing specific companies and tooling as well--API Evangelist partners like 3Scale, WSO2, and Restlet, but also other products I&rsquo;m personally invested in like APIs.json, and the companies, and tools I use daily like Swagger, API Blueprint, APITools, API Science, and Runscope. After five years of doing this, I&rsquo;m trying to understand what scale looks like for API Evangelist.

			<p><em>09 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>If you are an API developer, it is likely you have used Postman, the simple tool for building, testing, and documenting your APIs. I have Postman open as a Google Chrome App, which allows me to make API calls as I&rsquo;m designing, developing, and integrating with the APIs across my world. Something which opens up the response and requests of API calls that I&rsquo;m making, giving me more insight into how things are actually working (or not). One of the key aspects of Postman, are the collections, which: A collection lets you group individual requests together. These requests can be further organized into sub-collections/folders to completely mirror your API. Requests can also store variations and responses when saved in a collection. You can add metadata like name and description too so that all the information that a developer needs to use your API is available right where he(she) needs it. Collections are listed in the sidebar alphabetically. You can search through collection requests using the search form for quick access. To me, Postman Collections are API discovery at the API transaction level. Allowing you to define a single unit of currency in the API economy, save, and organize them, and execute them at any point in your API lifecycle. Postman Collections measure not just an API transaction that happens, it is a measure of future transactions that can happen, complete with any relevant meta data that will be needed along the way. Along with Swagger, and API Blueprint, I&rsquo;m working to better understand how Postman Collections impact, and fuel the API lifecycle, including conversations with Abhinav Asthana (@a85), Founder and CEO of Postman, about their roadmap. Postman Collections are not just about defining, organizing, and executing your API calls in the Postman client as a solo API developer, they are also about collaborating with other key players involved throughout the API lifecycle. I&rsquo;m setting up my API Stack as Postman Collections, to help me understand...[<a href="/2015/03/09/postman-collections-will-take-your-api-productivity-to-the-next-level/">Read More</a>]</p>

I was profiling the video sharing API Dailymotion the other day, going through their developer area and profiling their API operations. One of the things I do as part of the profiling of any company, is checkout how they execute their support.
Dailymotion employs two very common building blocks for their platform support, including an API specific Twitter handle, and good ol fashion email&mdash;both pretty proven approaches. However Dailymotion also employs a third aspect to thier API support, by recommending you head over to Stack Overflow for some community support.
Using Stack Overflow in this way is not that original, I see numerous API providers doing this, the part I found interesting was their reference to getting Dailymotion API support via Stack Overflow as, "ask the stack!" I like that, I think it reflects what Stack Overflow is to the API developer community, and was an elegant way to send API developers off your site, to get the support they need.

I was spending time profiling APIs late last night while putting back a couple of IPAs. Yes this is what I do on a Friday night, you have a problem with that? Anyways, I was crafting Swagger definitions for the 7digital music APIs, and the I came across their territories API. "The Territories API serves data about countries that 7digital operates in, data about those counties, and a one or more languages with shop urls in each country&rdquo;, something that I could see being pretty useful to developers when building music apps on top of the platform.
There has been numerous APIs I&rsquo;ve developed in the past, where the need for some supporting, utility APIs, such as a list of states, zip codes, counties, or other resources was called for. Two layers to doing this: 1) Acknowledging the little things developers need goes a long way in building trust with them, letting them know you actually care, and get what they are facing 2) You want devs to achieve integration as quickly as possible, provide them with the little things that they will have to go hunt for, and possibly prevent them from achieving their objectives. &mdash; Reduce any friction possible!
I'd like to see an open source library of utility API design, complete with a variety of server side code, and data stores emerge, that help API providers deliver a more complete stacks of API resources. If you need a state / province API, or a language API, you could just grab one off the shelf and install it seamlessly into your API stack. This is just one of those little areas, that I think could be slowing the overall advancement of APis (just a wee bit), and with a little community effort, could really grease the wheels in API adoption, and fuel more meaningful integrations.

			<p>I'm continuing my work, to help people understand what APIs.json is, and the varying ways that it can be put to use. My post the other week, breaking down Fitbits APIs.json file is a good example of where to get started, and as a follow-up I wanted to help further set the bar for what a minimum viable APIs.json&nbsp;looks like, and today, I am going in the other direction--toward my dream APis.json file. APIs.json starts with a basic set of descriptions for who you are, the API provider. Each header of an APIs.json file gives you a handful of parameters for describing who you are: name - your individual or company name, who is managing the APIs.json file. description - a description of your company and / or the API collection you are building. image - an image, logo, or icon that describes yourself or your company tags - a handful of key words and phrases that describe your API collection. created - the first date in which an APIs.json file was created. modified - the last date in which an APIs.json file created. url - The url of where the APIs.json lives, allowing your file to be portable. Those seven parameters provide details on who you are, and what the API collection is all about. Remember an API collection doesn&rsquo;t always have to live under a specific company domain like Twilio.com, it could be a temporary or more permanent collection, that is part of specific project or application. The next essential element of an APIs.json file, is the APIs collection, providing you the ability to describe one or many APIs as part of this collection. Similar to the parameters provided for the header, each API entry is allowed a handful of parameters that describe the API: name - the name of the API. description - a description of the value an API delivers. image - an image, logo, or icon that describes an API....[<a href="/2015/03/07/a-breakdown-of-my-dream-apis-json-file/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>06 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>I had a conversation with some folks who are building a wikipedia of API definitions the other day, looking to employ formats like Swagger, and APIs.json to make an open, authoritative directory of machine readable API designs&mdash;something I can get behind 100%. I can even contribute the 700+ APIs.json files, and the 250+ Swagger files I have generated&nbsp;as part of my research. When I have discussions about APIs.json folks, I always find it helpful to summarize the vision we have for the API discovery format, and described it in a short, concise way. This time around I was able to clarify the vision, in a way I hadn&rsquo;t fully been able to articulate before. To help me remember what I said, I wanted to capture it here on the blog.Many people who have heard about APIs.json as a sitemap for your APIs, but in reality there are three distinct ways I'm putting APIs.json to work: Providing A Sitemap - This is the simplest approach to using API.json, is to create a simple index of the APIs that exist within a domain. Defining API Collection - Defining a portable, machine readable collection of common, or disparate APIs, like I&rsquo;ve done with my SMS messaging API stack. Establishing New Definitions - A place to define the next generation of API definitions that support Swagger, Blueprint, adding licensing layer with API Commons, or maybe pricing, and the ability to answer service related questions. It can be easy to call APIs.json a sitemap for APIs, but it is much more. It has a lot of potential for defining API collections while also making them portable, and machine readable by default. Where I really get excited for the potential is when it comes to defining new definitions that can work in conjunction with existing definitions, like Swagger and API Blueprint. The last thing I want to leave you thinking about when it comes to APIs.json, is that it is designed...[<a href="/2015/03/06/three-ways-i-am-putting-apis-json-to-work/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>When I come across a new company, during the course of my monitoring and information gathering across the API space, I enter them into my company API. Once a company is in there, and I&rsquo;ve deemed it worthy enough for a closer look, I profile their operations. For my own organization, and in the spirit of transparency and collaboration, I wanted to breakdown what I mean by profiling. First I start with the basics: Name - The official name for any company or project. APis aren&rsquo;t always clearly defined corporate entities. Description - A short, concise description of what a company does. You&rsquo;d be surprised how hard this is. Logo - A clean, simple, medium resolution logo for company. Again, you&rsquo;d be surprised how hard this is. Then I dive into the common URLs that I care about, that provide me with the best signals possible: Blog - The heartbeat of any company, and API operations. In my opinion, the blog is one of the most important aspects of operations. Blog RSS - A simple, machine readable blog stream &mdash; blown away by how many companies don&rsquo;t have. Twitter - An active, engaged Twitter account, providing me easy access via the Twitter API. Github - A complete, active Github user or organization, where I can access code, and other aspects of API operations via Github API. Crunchbase - A business profile of a company, with a focus on the investment, and runway for company, available via Crunchable API. Angelist - Similar to Crunchbase a business profile of a company, with a focus on the investment, and runway for company, available via Angelist API. Then I tackle the API, or APIs, and profile each API they have by gathering: Name - A clean, portable name that describes the API, but keeps context of company or organization running it. Description - A short, concise description of what an API does &mdash; this is another pain in the...[<a href="/2015/03/06/my-ideal-profile-of-companies-who-are-doing-interesting-things-with-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

This site is where I publish news that I have read, stories I&rsquo;ve published, company I&rsquo;ve profiled, and valuable tools I&rsquo;m stumbled on across while researching API discovery. Finding APIs, and having your APIs found is a pretty significant pain point, and in the last ten years, little has been done to provide adequate solutions. API discovery is an area I've been monitoring, ultimately have been unsatisfied with what I've seen, I've take matters into my own hands, and created APIs.json, a machine readable API discovery format, any API provider can use to describe their APIs. There are several API management companies, including Apigee, Mashery, and Mashape who have put forth API discovery solutions, and while these offerings are valuable, I feel they lack the openness necessary to truly move the API space, and the API discovery conversation forward.

I was reviewing one of the many entries in my review queue of companies who are doing interesting things with APIs, and stumbled across the data visualization API&mdash;Lightning. Their implementation grabs my attention on several fronts, but their focus on delivering their API within your own infrastructure via a Heroku button, is one of the most relevant aspects.
This approach reflects a seismic shift occurring in how we deploy APIs, and how we deploy architecture overall.  You need a data visualization API, let me deploy my API into your cloud, or on-premise infrastructure using popular approaches to virtualization&mdash;developers do not need to go to the API, the API will now come to you, and live within your existing infrastructure stack.
I&rsquo;ve been talking about wholesale APIs a lot lately, showcasing the white label approach by some API providers, and exploring within the evolution of my own infrastructure, and as more savvy API providers jump in on this opportunity, you&rsquo;ll see more stories emerge trying to understand the shift going on. Lightning is accomplishing this with Heroku, and their embeddable button, but companies who embrace a containerized micro-service centered approach to API deployment, will have a wide open playing field for buying and selling of the wholesale API driven technology being deployed across the emerging API economy.

This isn't something I'll do every thursday, and not all conversations will make it in, but I figured it would help me process, as well as share some insight into the types of conversations I'm having being the scene. Here is a breakdown of the conversations I&rsquo;ve had today, anonymized to protect the lives of those involved: API Evangelist at Major Media Company - I usually dodge recruiter calls early on in the process, but this one got through because it came in as a referral from someone I knew. This was regarding a lead role at a major media company you all know, a position I&rsquo;m not interested in, but willing to help talk through what is next for companies who can&rsquo;t find the right person for the role of lead API Evangelist! Available API Deployment Resources - I&rsquo;ve had a lot of trouble finding competent resources for any stage of the API lifecycle, but when it comes to API deployment, it has been impossible to establish relationships development shops I can refer work to. I had a very promising conversation about scaling an existing team I&rsquo;ve work with to successfully deploy APIs at scale in the past, opening up the opportunities for a scalable resource I can tap for designing, developing, deploying, and even the ongoing management of API resources. #fingerscrossed Developing a Wikipedia for API Definitions - I&rsquo;m working hard to develop a public catalog of open API designs via APIs.io and the API Stack using the APIs.son format, and I had an interesting conversation with a group that is working on the "Wikipedia for APIs", using machine...[<a href="/2015/03/05/api-evangelist-call-thursday-summary-for-march-5th-2015/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Making a list of valuable APIs has been a staple of my tech blogging for 10 years now, and as I work to find even more meaningful ways of defining the API space, I&rsquo;m pushing the envelope on how I do API roundup stories. Instead of just finding a handful of valuable APIs, and providing an HTML list of them, I'm going to use APIs.json, to make sure all of my collections are machine readable by default. For each API I profile, it is valuable to have a nice logo, name, short description, and a link to the developer portal. However I want to also make sure other valuable, machine readable resources are also present like Twitter, Github, and Blog RSS. This is just the start, I want each API to also have a machine readable API definition using Swagger and API Blueprint as well--all indexed using an APIs.json file. I&rsquo;m using APIs.json in two ways, as an index for each API, as well as an index for the overall collection I&rsquo;m building--you will find the overall collection using the big {A} below, and each API has its own little {A}. To show you this in action, here is an SMS API collection I've built: SMS API Stack This is a collection of MSS APIs that are curated by the API Evangelist, as part of monitoring of the larger message API space.

			<p>I am adding four new building blocks, to my list of suggested building blocks that API providers should consider when crafting their API management strategy. These four building blocks, are based upon several things I&rsquo;ve seen in the space, and how some current deficiencies I&rsquo;ve identified that could slow things, and hold us back. These new building blocks are all about API providers practicing what they preach, and making the account for API consumers, and developers, programmatic through an API management API. As I was profiling the Maijet API as part of my email API research, I noticed they had an API for their developer accounts, and with the growth in the number of APIs being consumed, the need for account automation is only going to incease, something that is only getting even more critical when you think about the API service composition overhead needed to support the containerization and micro-services movement. To help stimulate this area, and encourage API providers to automate their API accounts, I&rsquo;m adding these four separate APIs building blocks, providing an overall blueprint for how API providers can launch a developer account API for their own API. I used Mailjet&rsquo;s approach as a base model, but quickly began looking at 3Scale own API design. 1) I use 3Scale, so I&rsquo;m familiar with their approach to user management 2) Their API was simple, robust, and clearly a proven approach that was working. I broke 3Scale&rsquo;s own endpoints down into four logical groups for v1 of this API management API blueprint. There were a number of features they had, that I wanted in there, but figured it was better to start out simple, and meet most of the common needs I'm seeing from my own experiences. Here is what I came up with, after taking a look at 3Scale&rsquo;s active docs.

			<p><em>03 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I had the pleasure of finally meeting someone in person, that I feel like I&rsquo;ve known for years, while I was over in Australia, for API Days Sydney&mdash;Keran McKenzie (@keranm), API Evangelist for MYOBapi. I got to drink, and talk with Keran (finally), but more importantly I got to listen to him talk about his approach to evangelism at the accounting API.
I have given, and listened to more talks on evangelism and advocacy than I care to remember. I always work hard to make sure I sit and list to as many evangelism talks as I can&mdash;there is always something to learn. Keran's talk was informative, thorough, and most importantly it was genuine. Keran discussed many of the proven areas of evangelism we all share, but not in a robotic or corporate way, he shared his, and MYOB&rsquo;s philosophy, and told the honest story about the challenges and triumphs.
Keran gives an energetic talk, but it wasn&rsquo;t just the high energy that sold it for me, it was demonstrating that he actually gives a shit about how to do it right, admitting he doesn&rsquo;t know everything, or nails it in all categories, and he gives an honest, friendly, approachable, and genuine story of what is API evangelism at MYOB.
This approach to API evangelism is critical to success. You won&rsquo;t last long as an evangelist if you are full of shit, or the company behind you is, sorry&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been in this position too many times. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, every API evangelist role is difficult, and full of compromises, challenges, and things that are out of your control&mdash;even in my world. In the end, the only thing you can do is be honest, genuine, and as transparent as you can, and never be afraid to tell you story like Keran does.

			<p>I spend a lot of time wading through press releases at the number of the dominate aggregate news outlets, looking for API news. I also have a number of scripts running, keeping an automated eye on the press sections for some of the companies I track on. The number of press releases available in corporate press areas vs. the number of press releases submitted by PR outlets, is much larger--which is a missed opportunity in my book. Each day I look through PRWeb, PR Newswire, Business Wire and others trying to find the latest API stories. This is a process that will always be partially a manual process, as you just can&rsquo;t look for API news without getting petroleum, education, pharmaceutical, and other API news&mdash;which has nothing to with my beloved application programming interface. In short, these sites suck. Their UI is crap, and their search mechanisms are shit.&nbsp; The biggest problem with these news outlets do not usually even have RSS, let alone an API, requiring me to go to each site, each day, and sift through the search results. The world of press releases is like many other industries I engage with&mdash;needs a dead simple API driven solution. I want a press release API that allows any company to submit for free, but the problem is nobody will in the beginning, so it also needs to go out and find the direct corporate press sources as well, and scrape this long tail of the PR world. I&rsquo;d pay a monthly fee to be able to search this vast PR database via an API, and be able to integrate directly into my API monitoring system. It is something I could build, but I just do not have time, and as I do with my other ideas, I am putting out there for someone else to do. The API would be a very simple design, but the legwork to make it truly a rich, and...[<a href="/2015/03/03/some-please-build-a-true-next-generation-press-release-aggregation-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I'm just getting started exploring the ways to use APIs.json&nbsp;when it comes organize my new Docker fueled, micro services stack. I&rsquo;ve been using APIs.son to describe each micro service, as well as define the overall collection of almost 20 micro services. I&rsquo;m using the include collection, as a navigation for the loosely coupled stack of micro-services, and my friend Chris Spiliotopoulos (@chefarchitect), has done some more work with his Swagger.ed, delivering some APIs.json goodness that is in alignment with where I want to take all of this.
Adding to the discovery and visualization work he did for Swagger, Chris enabled Swagger.ed to look for valid APIs.son files as well, so when you browse to any APIs.son, like the one I have for my micro services stack, you see the little APIs.son search icon in the address bar.

When you click on the APIs.son search icon in the address bar, you get a very cool visualization. Its pretty basic at the moment, just a visual catalog of the APIs available in the include collection of my stack, but when you connect up with the Swagger visualization work he's already done, we could have a pretty cool API catalog for managing and exploring microservices.

I have almost 20 micro-services listed, and Swagger.ed gives me the ability to navigate it in a very interactive way.  Whats next? We don&rsquo;t know&hellip;it is about exploration, and finding out the most meaningful way of exploring the APIs I deploy and aggregate into APIs.son collections.
I can see having a visual catalog of all of my API design that I collect, then deploy, and evolve them as needed for various parts of my infrastructure or for my clients, into other sub-collections? Disconnected collections? Loosely coupled collections? Not sure how tight I want things, part of the micro service definition for me is the size of the network connecting the services, as well as the services theselves.

			<p><em>02 Mar 2015</em></p>
			<p>A topic I've written about before, and one that I answer regularly on forums, via email, and on Twitter is, &ldquo;Are there any write APIs in the federal government?&rdquo; It is a valid question, and as I said in my strategy suggestions for the federal government, write APIs are a critical aspect of all of this moving forward in a healthy way. Rebecca Williams (@internetrebecca) pointed me to a recent discussion on this topic earlier today, to which I added a couple of suggestions, but ultimately it is something I would like to see a more progressive solution emerge, something that can answer it real-time, and change as the API inventory in the federal government changes and evolves. Keeping a list, like 18F is doing, is a start, but we need more. One of the side projects that I work on a couple of hours each week, is the profiling of federal government APIs using APIs.json, and Swagger, for use in my federal API stack. I only have a handful of the 120+ APIs that I&rsquo;m profiling completed, but once done, you will be able to search for APIs based upon whether or not an API uses the verbs GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE&mdash;giving you a much more detailed picture of how government APIs function. Generating machine readable API definitions in Swagger and API Blueprint are time consuming, but once you tie it together using a discovery format like APIs.json, it opens up a lot more opportunity to answer questions about government APIs. I&rsquo;m doing a lot of the heavy lifting currently, to establish a critical mass of API definitions in federal government, then I am hoping that each agency will take ownership over maintaining their own definitions--if not, I think it can just as easily be done from the outside-in, by the community. I&rsquo;m excited for the potential, when all of the meta-layer of APIs and open data in government is rich, well defined,...[<a href="/2015/03/02/using-machine-readable-api-definitions-to-solve-a-persistent-question-are-there-any-write-apis-in-federal-government/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>26 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I had the pleasure of attending a gathering at Heavybit Industries&nbsp;last week, a community for developer-focused entrepreneurs, where one of the headlining speakers was Nike CTO Chris Satchell. I wish I had taken better notes, but the one thing that stuck with me from his talk was his story about moving beyond their love affair with almost any software vendor that came along, and diligentlywork towards a micro-service oriented environment.
As the CTO, Satchell was working to clean up the message of legacy applications used across the enterprise, which was the result of years of, as he put it, saying yes to almost any software vendor that came along. Music to the ears of the San Francisco audience, he was now working to move the company out of a single data center, into the cloud, redefining operations as micro-services, and instituting a devops mindset along the way. They are a long way away from achieving their goal, but I found the change in their mindset about how they acquire software, was extremely relevant to all the API talk in 2015.
While i&rsquo;m sure there will still be plenty of opportunities for old school software vendors to hock their wares, I think this was a pretty clear sign of the API-centric approach that is changing not just how we develop and deploy software, but also how we buy software. If you are looking to sell software solutions to the enterprise in the future, you are going to need more than just yesterdays software, and a sales team&mdash;you are going to need the most agile, flexible, stack of micro-services possible, and let companies choose exactly the resources that they need.

			<p><em>26 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>This post has been open for almost two weeks now in Evernote. It began as a simple story about the possibility for generating code samples and libraries using Swagger. The longer it stays open, the wider the definition becomes, so I have to post something, just to draw a line in the sand. I&rsquo;m not talking about generating code that runs on the server, this post is all about everything on the API consumption side of things. Shortly after Wordnik launched the machine readable API definition format&nbsp;Swagger, they launched a library for generating client side code samples in a variety of languages. This was something that was evolved upon by Apiary, with the launch of their API design platform, and introduction of API Blueprint. Even with these advances forward, there were still many shortcomings, and debate around what you could actually auto-generate on the client-side using a machine readable API definition continued. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many random Tweets I get from people saying, &ldquo;Oh is auto-generation of code cool again?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I thought you couldn&rsquo;t auto-generate client code or SDKs ;-)" Amidst the debate about what is really possible, and the jokes about our SOA past, new players have emerged like Apimatic that are looking to raise the bar when it comes to generation of not just simple code samples, libraries or stubs, but sophisticated API SDKs. I am sure the jokes about automating client code will still occurs, but there is no denying that the overall conversation is moving forward. As I&rsquo;m exploring my own limitations of what is possible when generating client-side code with Swagger, I also come across new players like Lucybot, who are moving the conversation forward with API cookbooks, and Single Page App (SPA) generated from Swagger definitions. I&rsquo;m not in denial that there is a lot of work ahead, but in the two weeks that I&rsquo;ve been crafting this post, I&rsquo;d say I have gotten a glimpse...[<a href="/2015/02/26/generating-client-side-code-from-machine-readable-api-definitions/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>26 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;ve been talking about the possibilities around wholesale APIs for a while now, something that is only going to become more prevalent with the popularity of micro services and containers. I thought this company's approach to white label APIs was pretty basic, but worth showcasing, providing a glimpse of what is possible when you are talking about B2B APIs.
Recharge kit provides 15 separate APIs for wholesale usage. I thought it was a telco stack of APIs when I first landed, but it is an interesting mix of telco, utility, travel, and more. I predict companies will emerge with a much more nuanced stacks of micro-services than Recharge Kit, but their approach shows some of the thinking occuring in the space.
As part of the Recharge Kit white label package you also get a handful of API management tools, ranging from user management, and advertising, to billing, and support. The overall presentation is not that professional, but a lot of the essential API management building blocks are present.&nbsp;
Delivering API management resources in this portable, and flexible way is reflected in my recent exploration with my 3Scale API management infrastructure on Alpha API Evangelist. I'm looking to understand how not to just manage my B2D or B2C API consumption, but also allow me to deliver on a new wholesale side of my operations. Wholesale APIs deployed as micro services via Docker containers adds a whole new dimension to API management, opening up more B2B, wholesale, and white label API opportunities like this.

The API Evangelist network is my open workbench, and I understand for many, it can be confusing to see some of my half-baked ideas alongside some of my more hardened API 101, business of APIs, and politics of APIs work. I try to keep the API Evangelist blog containing information for the API newbie, as well as my more advanced API leader crew--something that is tough to do.
I have a lot of ideas coming off the assembly line around my own infrastructure, Docker, microservices, and other more forward leaning areas. Normally I dump a lot of this mundane exhaust from my world over on Kin Lane, but that site gets picked up by DZone, due to historical connections, and that audience is pretty trollish, second only to Hacker News. I'm not looking to get into petty fights over choice I made around my own infrastructure.
To support my newer ideas, I launched&nbsp;Alpha API Evangelist, which will act as a kind of staging ground for many of the ideas you may eventually see here on API Evangelist. I do not want to alienate my just getting going audience, with rants about Docker and microservice orchestration, and I definitely do not want some of my unproven thoughts to getting taken out of context alongside some of my rants around important API topics in the business and politics of APIs.
I know some of you are like WTF, another blog, you are diluting your brand, blah blah. If you saw the API Evangelist Network like I do, as this open workshop for API research, and storytelling, you&rsquo;d understand. Anyhoo&hellip;.long story short&hellip;90% of the Docker, microservices, orchestration, Github API blah blah blah, is now over at alpha.apievangelist.com.

			<p><em>24 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>During my monitoring of the API space this last week I had one of those rare discoveries, amongst thousands of misses, and around a hundred slightly interesting nuggets, a simple move forward called Lucybot emerges.&nbsp; I want to walk you through what I experienced as I had the tab open in my Chrome browser for the last week, in Lucybot's own words: LucyBot is a tool for on-boarding new API developers, and is meant to be used alongside traditional API documentation such as Swagger and I/O Docs. I really like this sentence when they start talking about generating API cookbooks: LucyBot generates cross-language cookbooks for any REST API. Design step-by-step walk-throughs for any use case, and LucyBot will provide cross-language code snippets, which expand into a working, visually-rich demo. Now you are talking my language. Swagger on Github is a powerful combo: LucyBot can also push the code to GitHub, where users are free to build it out further, e.g. by pulling in data from their own servers or other APIs. Add some API Blueprint to the mix, and now you have some serious API coverage. It can be difficult to understand the vision behind a new API driven start-up&mdash;I look at quite a few new companies. To help move the process forward, let&rsquo;s start with the basics of what is significant about Lucynbot&rsquo;s perspective n API. There are two things that stand out for me: Learning About APIs - Lucybot takes an API definition like Swagger, and turns it into an interactive walk-through for on-boarding with an API. Think Swagger UI, but more interactive walk-through than interactive documentation--now add in a little Swagger driven Codecademy to help you authenticate, and navigate the request and response of each API. #Boom API Driven Clients - Lucybot isn't just generating interactive documentation or walk-throughs, they are generating a single page application (SPA).

			<p>In my day to day operations, I get regular calls from VC's (Venture Capitalists) looking to better understand APIs, the role they are playing within specific industries, working towards a better awareness of how they will impact their portfolio. These conversations almost always end with the question, "what can I do for you?", something that always leads to the next question, "what does scale look like for API Evangelist?". A verty interesting set of questions... Interestingly, the answers to these questions are directly related to another common question I get from people in the space, "how do you make money?". I'm fortunate. I get to scale API Evangelist exactly as I see fit, because I get to choose who I take money from. All money has strings attached, and I want to make sure these strings lead me in positive directions, and never hold me back, or force me to make decisions that would be negative for the API space. This is something that is much easier to do in 2015, than it was in 2010, when I first started API Evangelist. This leads me to yet another question I get from people, &ldquo;how do I do what you do?&rdquo;. A question which I do not have a good answer for. Honestly I do not fully understand how I got here, and not sure folks can deal with being as broke as I&rsquo;ve been over the last five years, something that only recently has changed with the support of my partners, 3Scale, WSO2, and Restlet. I did not set out to build API Evangelist using a single plan, I&rsquo;m making this shit up as I go along, and honestly I do not remember all the decisions I&rsquo;ve made over the last five years, resulting in my current position. So why am I rambling on about this? Because it brings home what scale actually means to me at API Evangelist.

			<p><em>23 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve written about this topic before, in an effort to understand the possible incentives for API providers to generate their own machine readable API definitions in formats like Swagger and API Blueprint. These machine readable definitions for APIs and microservices are important to have, but not everyone produces them by default for their APIs, and honestly nobody is going to create them until there are enough incentives to sweeten the pot. It helps me to walk through this story again, understand the incentives for generating API definitions to date, in hopes of better understanding where we are going. Early on Wordnik developed Swagger, to generate: Interactive Documentation - Making learning about an API, a hands-on experience, accelerating time to first API call. Generate Server-Side Code - Automatic generation of server side skeletons that take out much of the repetitive work of API deployment. Generate Client-Side Code - Automatic generation of client side code samples, and libraries, making API integration a much quicker process. Then Apiary came along and moved the needle back, making API definitions more about API design than just API management and integration, with the introduction of API Blueprint, with: API Design Editor - Apiary introduced the concept of API definitions and API design, with their introduction of their cloud-based API design tooling. Mock API Generation - API definitions aren&rsquo;t just for managing API deployment anymore, you can mock APIs, saving costly development cycles, early on in the life cycle. Now we are seeing other providers like Apimatic, Ardoq, and others step up to continue expanding what you can do with machine readable API definitions. I wanted to take a moment to brainstorm everything I am seeing, and would like to see emerge along the API life cycle, that could be driven by Swagger and API Blueprint API definitions. SDK Generation - Going beyond auto-generation of simple samples and libraries, and generating full SDKs.

			<p><em>23 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>I constantly struggle to stay in tune with the scope of the API space, and keep pace with its rapid expansion. As part of this struggle,&nbsp;I am always on the hunt for new ways to shift the way I look at the space&mdash;as long as it helps me understand things better, while also contributing as much valuable, and open information back to the API space. The With this in mind, the API Evangelist monitoring algorithm is always in flux, with the latest change being the elimination of the &ldquo;number of APIs&rdquo; or &ldquo;number of new APIs&rdquo;, from the monitoring equation. I have showcased the growth in public APIs for a long time now, and for a while, it was what I needed to motivate my research and storytelling, but after almost five years, these two data points are becoming a liability for me. As I go through the 700+ companies that are doing interesting things in the space, and generate APIs.json profiles, and machine readable API definitions using Swagger and API Blueprint, I realize quantity or number of APIs has no bearing on my research, and it is just a distraction. Any number of APIs is meaningless if I cannot understand what these APIs do, their pricing, quality of service, terms of these services, and easily match with my own business objectives&mdash;elements I&rsquo;m working hard to define, and quantify in a machine readable way using APIs.json. In the everyday reality of the API space, there is no reason for me care about how many APIs there are, a goal that comes bundled with the desire to chase new APIs, in support of this metric. Sure I want to be informed about new, and interesting APIs that come into the space, but chasing them in the support of some data point, that actually has no bearing on my research, is a waste of my time. When you couple this with my struggles to keep up with...[<a href="/2015/02/23/looking-beyond-the-number-of-apis-or-just-new-apis-and-working-harder-to-find-only-the-most-important-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>Some of the side effects of being so open and transparent about my ideas, like the one I had around API visualizations, is that people who are doing similar things, like Ardoq, eventually find you. Even better, is when someone closely follows your thoughts, and takes your ideas, and sets into motion, your original idea, in a way that will allow it to become bigger than the original idea. Last week Chris Spiliotopoulos (@chefarchitect) sent me an email, with a simple Chrome extension attached, asking what I thought. After installing the add-on (just drag onto your Chrome extension page), I visited my notebook of Swagger defined APIs over at API Stack, and when Twilio&rsquo;s Swagger definition loaded in the browser, I saw a little Swagger icon show up in my browsers address bar&mdash;you know kind of like when there is an RSS feed available. I click on the icon, and a new layer to my browser opens up, with a simple, crude, yet potentially powerful visualization of Twilio&rsquo;s API surface area. Honestly, the visualization does little for sorting out the complexities of the API, but it demonstrates a possible future, where we can browse the Internet, stumble across APIs, and their machine readable definitions, and open up an entirely new, visual layer that helps us quantify, and make sense of what an API does. APIs are a very abstract concept, and helping developers understand the scope and value of an API can be difficult, the introduction of API definition driven visualizations go a long way in helping speed up the conversation. Imagine being able to immediately understand the scope of a microservice. How big is micro? Can I see a tag cloud of parameters? Is there a visualization layer to explore the underling data model? Can you provide me with a visualization diff between two similar APIs, defined using Swagger or API Blueprint. I&rsquo;m just getting going on brainstorming ideas for visualizations, and so is...[<a href="/2015/02/23/i-got-swagger-ed-last-week-and-now-i-am-seeing-api-visualizations/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>I have API tooling on the brain, a result of conversations on multiple fronts, and the evolution of my own thoughts on creating what I&rsquo;d see as the perfect API design tool. My thoughts on API tooling, reflect my general API philosophy, and focus on developing small, meaningful tools that truly make an impact. First, nobody likes being dependent on bloated software products. The age where software looks like Microsoft Office in my opinion, is over, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to a brighter future. I feel pretty strongly that we need small, simple tools, that work in concert, not via a single client I have to pay for 100% of features, to get just 2% of the features I actually need to get done, what I need. One of my popular Github repositories is my CSV Converter, which is just a reworking of Mr. Data Converter, to which I added the ability to save XML, JSON, and CSV files directly to Github, making a completely client-side data management tool that runs 100% on Github pages. I like this idea developing small, stand-alone tooling for the API space, and is something you will see a lot more from me in coming months. As I work to refine, and evolve my thoughts on the perfect API designer, I&rsquo;m engaged in several conversations, about what the tooling could look like to support this vision, and the consensus seems to be that the next generation of tooling has to reflect an API philosophy&mdash;simple, small, stand-alone tools that do one thing and do it well. Something you can see this in popular API tooling like APITools, and Postman. In recent times, I have been very adverse to developing any web or mobile client that someone else will depend on, stemming form PTSD developed by owning so much legacy code over my 25 year career. I'm happy to see that it isn&rsquo;t just me, and that there are so many other...[<a href="/2015/02/23/developing-small-simple-meaningful-tools-that-make-an-impact-across-the-api-space/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>I was just listening to segment on NPR, All Things Considered, about educating students around the environment. Throughout the program I couldn&rsquo;t help be reminded of a similar imbalance in the world of APIs. Throughout my API experience I&rsquo;m constantly faced with a separation between what I hear is possible, what I would like to see, and what actually occurs on the ground in startups, small businesses, and within enterprise organizations, and government agencies. You might have to listen to the segment&nbsp;to fully grasp what I mean, but essentially it comes down to this: we&rsquo;d like a perfect world where we do not negatively impact the environment, and everyone understands the urgency, but in reality there are a lot of real world constraints that prevent us from truly realizing this vision. In the world of APIs, these same constraints exist. We&rsquo;d like to achieve API harmony in everything we do, but in reality there are a lot of real world constraints we have to navigate, from knowledge and education, to the time and resources needed to implement. This chasm reflects the challenge in my API Evangelist mission. How do steer clear of selling people a single product, platform, or holistic vision of an API strategy, and break things into small, bite-size chunks of information that anyone can use (or not use) as they see fit, in the environments they operate within. I don&rsquo;t believe there is a silver bullet, or single religion to follow here, it is all about staying in tune with what is working, and what is not&mdash;then making your own decisions about what is appropriate on the ground. API Evangelist was born out of my success and failures working at SAP&mdash;which was all about striking a balance between what I knew was possible, what I wanted, and what was really possible in the environment I operated in. Alright, enough pontificating, and back to understanding all of this. I guess my point is,...[<a href="/2015/02/23/api-evangelism-sometimes-seems-similar-to-the-environmental-discussion-what-we-would-like-does-not-reflect-what-actually-happens-on-the-ground/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>
There is an interesting story about Twitter trolling over at Yahoo News from CBCNews.ca, which includes recommendations from Adria Richards (@adriarichards) for using the Twitter API to crack down on trolling, based upon her own experiences. Here is the specific API mention from the story:
Richards has shared her own recommendations for Twitter to clamp down on trolling, which include making trending harassment patterns available via the application programming interface (API) and allowing users to subscribe to blacklists to exclude words from their timelines.
I think APIs can playing a larger roll when it comes to online trolling, but we&rsquo;ll need someone to step-up and own the topic, working with Twitter, and other social networks to expose the right APIs, and give more control to end-users. Then also help encourage the development of open tooling on top APIs, that help users manage their online profiles, manage filter settings, manage black and white lists, and other key features.
I'll continue to consider the potential of anti-trolling APIs, alongside other account, security, and privacy considerations, and see if we can start identifying some potential API patterns and approaches that can be re-used across the space.

			<p>
I was playing catchup on my feeds over the weekend, and came across a nice, meet the Mendeley platform team post, from the academic research API. I&rsquo;m a big fan of these types of efforts, that help humanize API operations, and bring API providers closer to API consumers. From the outside, it is difficult see behind the API curtain, and showcasing the team, is one of the best ways to break down barriers.
Simple things like showcasing the team, let each one tell their story, and providing Twitter accounts for each team member goes a long way in helping me connect with what an API does. Something that will continue beyond just this one post, because I followed each team member that is active on Twitter, and will be able to stay in tune asynchronously.
In the technical shuffle of API oeprations, it can be easy to forget about little touches like this, which is why I&rsquo;m going to add team showcase as a building block to my API management list. When you are building out your API management strategy, it helps to have things like team showcase on the checklist.

			<p><em>14 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>If you were at Defrag in Colorado last November, or in Sydney, Australia for API Days last week, you&rsquo;ve heard me talk about what containers are doing to APIs. There is a subtle, but important shift in how APIs are being deployed occurring right now, and as John Sheehan (@johnsheehan), the CEO of Runscope&nbsp;says, containers are doing for APIs, what APIs have been doing for businesses. As I was processing news for API.Report this morning, I found more evidence of this, with the release of logging API container from Logentries. APIs have made resources like &ldquo;logging&rdquo;, much more modular and portable, for use in multiple channels like mobile or via websites. A containerized logging API makes the concept of a logging API much more portable, by adding an entirely new dimension for deployment. You don&rsquo;t just have a logging API, you now have a logging API that can be deployed anywhere in the cloud, on-premise, or on any physical object. This opens up a whole new world of APIs, one that goes beyond just a programmable web, quickly evolving us towards a programmable world, for the better, and the worse. Last month I asked, when will my router have docker containers by default? I received an email from a major network equipment manufacturer this week, letting me know that they are working on it. This means little containers on the Internet enabled objects across our worlds, ushering in the ability to deploy localized, wholesale APIs, giving us the ability to manifest exactly the virtual API stacks that we need, for any objective. I try not to hype up where things are going in the API space, so I will stick with calling containers a significant evolution in how APIs are done. This new way of deploying APIs will push the evolution around the business of APIs, changing how we make generate revenue from valuable resources, while also putting even more stress on the politics of...[<a href="/2015/02/14/are-your-apis-ready-for-the-coming-containerization-evolution-of-the-api-space/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>12 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>LinkedIn recently announced some changes to their developer program, which involves further tightening down the screws on who has access to the API, limiting public access to only a handful of very superficial APIs. If you want greater access to the business social network API, you will need to be an officially approved partner. As a result of LinkedIn&rsquo;s announcement, you will hear more discussion about the demise of public APIs, as this is narrative many API providers would like to employ, to support their own command and control positions around their client, or very own API driven resources. There is nothing wrong with having private APIs with supporting partner programs, but this has no bearing on the viability of publicly available APIs. In reality, LinkedIn&rsquo;s API never really was open. Sure it is a public API, but the API has never been developer friendly, often times taking a very adversarial stance with its community, as opposed to embracing, nurturing, and investing in its developer ecosystem. Honestly, this is ok. Not every company has the DNA, or business model to make public APIs work&mdash;this latest move by LinkedIn reflects their ability, and not the potential of public APIs. We can&rsquo;t expect all companies to be able to make public APIs work, it isn't easy. When it comes to making money around valuable content and data online, a closed ecosystem is seen as being better. Tighter control over your users data exhaust, allows you to decide who can do what, limiting to just the partners who have business relationships with you. You just can't monetize user generated to the extent LInkedIn would like, without taking away users control and access to this data. Even with LinkedIn stance, there are a number of lessons to be learned by studying their approach. Like Twitter and Facebook, there are plenty of positive moves to analyze, as well as numerous other negative elements, that you can learn from when crafting...[<a href="/2015/02/12/changes-to-linkedin-developer-program-are-no-surprise/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>After seeing the conversation around my In The Future There Will Be No Public vs. Private APIs, I'm reminded of my own mission. I write on API Evangelist first and foremost for my own education, and secondarily I do it to help educate the normals about the importance of APIs. Not page-views. Not to educate the API echo chamber. Not to drive conversation over at DZone or Hacker News. Definitely not to insult anyone. That story was me working through my own service composition, and looking at one possible future. That exchange you hear in the story, and all my stories, is the conversation between the voices in my head, and is never mean to insult anyone (think Michael Keaton in Birdman). All of this has reminded me that API Evangelist is not about cutting edge stories, like the unproven stuff I'm doing with my own API architecture, docker and microservices. However it is critical that I still flush out my ideas, in my own way, so I'll move these stories to my personal blog kinlane.com. As I re-read that post, I&rsquo;m faced with the link-baity title, which was not crafted with that intent, and the error and brevity in one statement that was singled out and ultimately fueled the conversation. I&rsquo;m always happy to see conversation stirred, but not in the way it was around David&rsquo;s post. It is ridiculous that I would allude to privacy being gone from the conversation around APIs (really?), but ultimately I was pleased to see most people make the same argument that I was having in my own head. I&rsquo;m super thankful for having APIEvangelist.com, and my readers. It makes it possible that to bring in the little bit of money I do from 3Scale, Restlet, and WSO2, to pay my rent, and fund my research and learning.

			<p>The API savvy folks over at Apimatic are at it again, pushing forward the conversation around generating of software development kits, using machine readable API formats, and this time the doorway to your SDK is via the API Commons manifest. I'm going to go ahead and use their own description, as it sums it well, no augmentation needed. Using the code generation API, you can generate SDKs for your API directly from your Github repository.&nbsp; Step 1: Describe you API using some format. You may choose from Swagger, RAML, APIBlueprint, IODocs, and Google Discovery formats. Automatic code generation makes use of information in your API description to generate method and classes names. Please be as expressive as possible by not leaving out any optional fields as applicable e.g., not leaving out types and schemas for your parameters and fields. Step 2: Define meta information about your API using API Commons manifest format. You can generate your API Commons manifest using the API Commons Manifest generator. Be sure to enter all relevant information. Upload the generated manifest as a new file in the root directory of your Github repo by the name "api-commons- manifest.json". Be sure to have the correct name and location of this file. Step 3: Open/Create a markdown file (README.md is a good candidate). Add the following markdown syntax to render an image link. [![apimatic][apimatic-{platform-name}-image]][apimatic-{platform- name}-url] [apimatic-{platform-name}-url]: https://apimatic.io/api/github/{account-name}/{repo-name}/{branch- name}?platform={platform-name} [apimatic-{platform-name}-image]: https://apimatic.io/img/github/{platform-name}.svg Replace the {platform-name} token with one of the following values: windows, android, iosReplace the {account-name} token with the name of your url-encoded Github account name Replace the {repo-name} token with the name of your url-encoded Github repository name Replace the {branch-name} token with the name of your url-encoded Github branch name where the API Commons manifest file is present. ï¿¼ To validate, open the following url after replacing tokens.

			<p><em>08 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>I'm continuing my work to help people understand what APIs.json is, and the varying ways that it can be put to use. My post the other day, breaking down Fitbits APIs.json file is a good example of where to get started, but I wanted to help further set the bar for a minimum viable APIs.json. APIs.json starts with a basic set of descriptions of who you are, the API provider. Each header of an APIs.json file gives you a handful of parameters for describing who you are: name - your individual or company name, who is managing the APIs.json file. description - a description of your company and / or the API collection you are building. image - an image, logo, or icon that describes yourself or your company. tags - a handful of key words and phrases that describe your API collection. created - the first date in which an APIs.json file was created. modified - the last date in which an APIs.json file created. url - The url of where the APIs.json lives, allowing your file to be portable. Those seven parameters provide details on who you are, and what the API collection is all about. Remember an API collection doesn&rsquo;t always have to live under a specific company domain, it could be a temporary or more permanent collection, which is part of specific project or application. The next essential element of an APIs.json file, is the APIs collection, providing you the ability to describe one or many APIs as part of this collection. Similar to the parameters provided for the header, each API entry is allowed a handful of parameters that describe the API: name - the name of the API. description - a description of the value an API delivers. image - an image, logo, or icon that describes an API. tags - a handful of key words and phrases that describe the API itself. humanURL - The url any human...[<a href="/2015/02/08/a-minimum-viable-apis-json-file-for-your-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>David Berlin has a rebuttal post on ProgrammableWeb to my recent post&nbsp;In The Future There Will Be No Public vs. Private APIs, called Long Live The Private API. I&rsquo;m a big fan of doing story responses using our blogs versus the sometimes difficult Twitter conversations that occur--so I am happy to craft a response as well. I&rsquo;m less of a fan of playing into page view games of fabricated kerfuffles, and link-bait titles, which after re-reading, my own blog title was a little link-baity. However in reality, my story came from my workbench as I was reworking some of the service composition stack, and reflect that process, not the conversation it seems to have created, but hey, I am all about embracing unintended consequences. First, let me address my mistake. I said "If it has an http:// in front of the address, it is a public API&mdash;sorry.&rdquo;, which is total bullshit. As John Sheehan reminded me after I posted, at the point of DNS is what I should have meant, you can definitely use http:// on a totally private network, and what I meant to articulate was once you start making call via http://, using a DNS address. Second, David really makes my case for me, so in reality we are in agreement, it is all about semantics&mdash;which really is the core of my argument. Private, like the term open is thrown around a lot, usually by marketers, who want to elicit some sort of emotion response from their intended audience, much like David is with his story. All I&rsquo;m pointing out, in my own journey, is I used to have two buckets, public, and private. Then I had three buckets internal, public, and partner. Now I have mulitiple buckets that reflect products, projects, dev groups, and the organic organizational structure that has emerged around the resources I manage, and put to use. Private just doesn&rsquo;t describe my organizational structure anymore. My organization spans the...[<a href="/2015/02/06/when-you-are-ready-for-nuanced-discussion-about-who-has-access-to-your-api-i-am-here/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>06 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>I'm a big fan of putting my ideas for new tools, services, and other stuff out on the Internet, for public consumption. My mother taught me how to manifest things in my life, and this is my digital version of her teachings. By putting my ideas out there, a) I don't actually feel compelled to do them b) someone else might think it is good idea and build it, and c) when someone does build it and they start looking to publicize, they will find you. c) happened today. One idea that I put out there recently, that I really wanted to manifest, was a visualization layer for APIs using Swagger. My wish has been granted, and a startup called Ardoq, has done just that, developed a visualization layer using Swagger. As they were taking their new product public they came across my story, and pinged me this morning. I&rsquo;m going to follow-up, with a link to the story, and get a full tour of the product, talk with the team, and better understand what they are up to. Ardoc is an important next step for machine readable API definition conversation, adding another incentive for API providers to generate definitions for their APIs in API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML. I really see three main phases of the evolution so far in this conversation, 1) when Wordnik introduce Swagger and Swagger UI, 2) with introduction of Apiary.io moving the conversation further upstream to API design, and now 3) more meaningful visualizations built on top of APIs and microservices. Machine readable API definitions have done many significant things for the API conversation, allowing us to deploy interactive documentation, mock interfaces, ultimately giving us a common language that we can use to communicate around some very abstract concepts. I&rsquo;m excited to see visualizations enter the discussion, which will allow us to build powerful visual tooling around APIs, like being able to map the scope of a microservice, or...[<a href="/2015/02/06/my-wish-has-been-granted-swagger-driven-api-visualizations-from-ardoq/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>05 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>I've been talking about developing virtual API stacks for a while now, and as I continue understand current shifts in cloud computing, I am doing my own&nbsp;reshuffling towards a more microservices, and docker-centric way of life. When I say the phrase &ldquo;virtual API stack&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m talking about the ability to deploy a stack of APIs you need for a specific organization, project, app, or other configuration. In 2015, you should be able to quickly define exactly the stack of private, and public API services you need to accomplish exactly what you need--nothing more. As part of my research in this area, I&rsquo;m tracking on similar patterns, that I see occurring at platform providers--today I found an example of defining virtual API stacks using the service broker API over at IBM Bluemix. Using Bluemix, you can build virtual API stacks from existing services they have setup, including Twilio, and Sendgrid, or register your own APIs using service broker, via their cloud marketplace&nbsp;(you have to be partner). The services deploy in this way, need to implement a common API surface area dictated by the platform (I&rsquo;d love to see a Swagger spec for this IBM). IBM is blending several areas I&rsquo;ve been tracking on, starting with&nbsp;defining of virtual stacks, but also the aggregation of 3rd party services which opens up a wholesale layer of valuable API resources, and sets up world where API brokers can emerge, and prosper. I see that IBM has embraced machine readable API definitions like Swagger as part of their operations, and I&rsquo;d love to see them adopt APIs.json for defining of their virtual API stacks or collections. APIs.json would make the API collections that users define, much more portable, shareable, indexable, and ultimately discoverable. If you need example of APIs.json + Swagger working, look through my API Stack inventory, as I map out the top APIs. My vision of a future with API stacks and collections, is a world where we can...[<a href="/2015/02/05/defining-virtual-api-stacks-using-the-service-broker-api-over-at-ibm-bluemix/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2015/02/04/what-exactly-is-api-commons/">What Exactly Is API Commons?</a></h3>
			<p><em>04 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>
As I travel around talking to folks about APIs, I spend as much time as I can educating folks about API Commons, and I&rsquo;m constantly reminded how little people, who have even heard, and read about API Commons, really understand what it is. With this in mind, I will be regularly publishing examples of what API Commons is, to help onboard everyone to mine and Steve's (@njyx) vision of API Commons.
API Commons is a machine readable pointer to the license of your API. As I talk with folks, and watch videos like this one at APICon in UK, I realize how many misconceptions there are about it. Many folks emphasize the Creative Commons license we&rsquo;ve chosen, or the listing of APIs we&rsquo;ve had added to our version of the commons, by publishing an API Commons manifest, which references a CC-BY or CC0 license.
If you feel your API should be covered under an open source license, or covered by your patent, or not covered by any sort of license, create an API Commons manifest that points to your API, references your license, and you&rsquo;ve created your own commons. Now you can spider, and aggregate any API providers who have used the same license, into your own definition of what is the API Commons.
API Commons is not an API directory. API Commons is not a push for copyright in APIs. API Commons is a machine readable format for taking a stance on the licensing (or not) of your API definitions, and data models. Please join us today, by letting us know your stance on licensing of your API, we&rsquo;ve love to hear your voice, and better understand your stance.

			<p><em>04 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>I remember the vision clearly from 2004, when I first changed the URL for my Delicious social bookmarking account to make it return a list of bookmarks as XML instead of HTML. It was a vision of the programmable web--where everything I explored on the Internet, wasn&rsquo;t just consumable, and right below the surface of any website or application I was using, there was also a machine readable version, allowing me to build whatever I desired. People are often surprised when they realize I do not have anything to sell them, and that I evangelize that APIs are not some new product, but just the next step in the evolution of the web. This is easy to say, however it can be much harder to demostrate to the &ldquo;normals&rdquo;, leaving me always hundting for easy to understand API implementations I can use to help bring me people closer to understanding. Steve Ziegler (@stevezieglerva) introduced to me to a great new example of this in the wild. An API I haven&rsquo;t come across before, and I was pleasantly surprised to see it was a partnership between Department of Commerce, Energy, Interior, State Department, Transportation, EPA, Health &amp; Human Services, NASA, National Science Foundation, Smithsonian, USAID, and USDA. According to their own description the Global Change Information System is: The US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) has established the Global Change Information System (GCIS) to better coordinate and integrate the use of federal information products on changes in the global environment and the implications of those changes for society. For me the Global Change Information System is an example of how websites, linked data, and APIs should work in concert, but is something I understand very little about how to actually do. The GCIS&nbsp;platform organizes an amazing amount of information, all the people, organizations, and relationships involved, in a very elegant way-you can start seeing in action by browsing the database, by clicking on the menu in...[<a href="/2015/02/04/what-do-i-mean-when-i-say-apis-are-just-the-next-step-in-the-evolution-of-the-web/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>My work on APIs for the Department of Education, and the FAFSA API began while I was working in Washington DC as a Presidential Innovation Fellow. Shortly after leaving DC, I was informed that conversations around an API for the FAFSA had been put on back-burner, and in response I developed a prototype FAFSA API to help jumpstart the conversation. In December 2013, I went to one of the two data jams put on my the White House and Dept of Education, up in Palo Alto, CA at Stanford. Then, in January 2014 I heard there was talk at the secretary level, about officially pursuing a FAFSA API. Yay! By February I got an email that there was an opportunity for funding such an initiative, if there was a technical specification available. Three days layer I finished a couple of options, which ultimately resulted in a draft technical proposal for a possible FAFSA API. I&rsquo;ve heard nothing about the outcome of these efforts. I provided some thoughts on APIs in general, in June of 2014, in repose to their RFI, but beyond that it has been radio silence at Department of Education when it comes to a FAFSA API. Granted, I&rsquo;m not pursuing this, but when it comes to FAFSA API discussion, I own the SEO conversation, so if it came up, I&rsquo;m sure someone would ping me. I have no confidence that the Department of Education will pursue a FAFSA API. My motivations around contributing to the conversations stem from a desire to jumpstart investment from both the public, and the private sector. While jumpstarting conversations in the federal government, I was hoping I could also jumpstart the development, and deployment of a federated FAFSA API, which in turn would apply pressure on the federal government to participate. Doing this is not trivial, and a cause that needs a champion or full time evangelist&mdash;I&rsquo;m not your man. The FAFSA API is an excellent example...[<a href="/2015/02/04/recap-of-apis-at-dept-of-education-and-the-fafsa-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>I've been pretty focused on web APIs in my API Evangelist world, steering clear of hardware, networking, desktop software, and the American Petroleum Institute. While you will never catch me paying attention to oil, I am slowly changing my tune on other types of legacy APIs. As I read through the first 700, of the 16K API related patents I&rsquo;ve harvested from USPTO XML files, I initially started dismissing hardware related patents, and then some of the more network related ones as well. Then I started evaluating the impact these patents could have on the Internet of Things (IoT), and I am beginning to shift my stance. I may not fully profile the approaches of some of these API providers, but I think I will at least bookmark, and consider the approach, and how its being applied, while also putting on my web API architect hat. As I read through a press release today on Infolytica corporation releasing the next generation of their MotorSolve software, complete with mention of an API, I can&rsquo;t help but think of the implications if Infolytica embraced a web-API strategy. Imagine the potential, if MotorSolve was broken up, migrated into the cloud, and containerized? Then add in the necessary business building blocks like docs, code, pricing, and the requisite political building blocks like rate limits, terms of services, etc. This is the lens I am looking at older patents I am reading through, that may not 100% reflect modern web APIs, but because our virtual and physical worlds are increasingly merging with the growth of Internet of Things (IoT), and Software Defined Networking (SDN), might have significant impact if just looked at a little differently. Overall I see an pretty interesting opportunity in trying and consider all types of APIs, no matter their origins, reconsidering them in light of shifts in compute like the cloud, mobile, IoT, and SDN, and see what we can learn. You&rsquo;ll see more news reports...[<a href="/2015/02/04/i-see-an-opportunity-in-paying-attention-to-other-types-of-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>I get a lot of folks who come to my blog, see the title, read one or two posts, and assume that I&rsquo;m a blind lover of API technology, and that I see APis as a solution to everything. While some of this is true, I do love APIs, and think they are a great solution (in some cases), at the same time I&rsquo;m also an outspoken critic of APIs, and work hard to be a voice of reason when I see people doing stupid shit with them. With this theme in mind, I want to once again remind everyone that APIs are neither good, nor bad, nor neutral by themselves, they are merely one of the tools companies can wield, and completely reflect the motivations of their masters. One such example of this in action, where I believe an API is being used for some pretty bad reasons is with the AT&amp;T sponsored data API. I&rsquo;ve tried to support AT&amp;T as much as I can, because I really want to help the enterprise make sense of web APIs, and teach them to wield them in positive ways, but I have to say the sponsored data API is not something I can get behind. Upon closer examination this API is working to close down, control and meter the Internet, rather than opening up the Internet making it more accessible, and usable by AT&amp;T customers. Allowing for mobile users to get their music, video and other content delivered in a way that doesn&rsquo;t impact their phone bill seems like a good idea, and allowing companies to step in an sponsor the delivery of data and content for users, may smell like a good opportunity when you own the pipes, but this is leading us down a dark road. I&rsquo;m sorry, there are much more interesting ways to optimize the delivery of content, and make money off the Internet pipes you have--AT&amp;T you lack imagination, and creativity....[<a href="/2015/02/04/apis-used-to-close-rather-than-open-the-internet/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I spent a portion of my time each day reviewing press release sites, in addition to the 1000+ blogs I keep an eye on, for syndication to API.Report. During the course of my work this year, I'm noticing an uptick in the number of press releases that are about some new app, feature, and partnership that has an API at its core.
Telling the story of prominent integrations is something I am a big advocate for, but I think the growth in the number of official press releases about API integrations shows that the mainstream SMB and enterprise markets are putting APIs to work more, and looking to showcase. For me, this demonstrates that APIs are playing more of a central role in not just the deployment of apps, but the course of regular business for an increasing number of companies in 2015.
I&rsquo;m guessing that many more companies will be showcasing the API integrations that they achieve, long before they talk about the APIs they posess, let alone make publicly available. Ideally, everyone would be both a public API provider and consumer, but I&rsquo;m afraid that many companies just don&rsquo;t have the culture for such a thing&mdash;keeping their APIs closer to their chest, while still beating the API integration drum. Because it is what you do in 2015.

			<p><em>03 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I spend a significant portion of my day looking for company logos, for use in the API stories I tell. When I come across a proper implementation of a logo page, one of the business building blocks I recommend employing, I have to showcase it.
I got an email from my friend and fellow API evangelist Keran McKenzie (@keranm) about updating the listing for the MYOB API on my API Stack. He sent me a better description, and a couple of new links that I didn&rsquo;t have, including a link to their logo page.
One thing that I think is particularly interesting about the MYOB logo approach, is that they offer an assortment of designs:

Corporate Logo - The MYOB name and logo represent the MYOB business and is protected by copyright and trademark laws.
Developer Logos - The MYOB Premium Developer Logo is reserved for the exclusive use of MYOB Premium Developer Partners.&nbsp;
Add-On Logos - The MYOB Certified Add-On logo is exclusively available to Add-Ons that have completed the MYOB Add-On Certification process. Product Logos - A full collection of product specific logos.

First, a logo page is essential in assisting the media, and other folks like me, who will be talking about your services, be more successful. Second, their assortment of logos, shows MYOB has a well thought partner framework, that encourages developers to work hard, obtain premium status, and build certified add-ons.
A logo page, with a rich set of, well-planned embeddable logos, and other images, is an important API management building block&nbsp;that tends to also be a signal of APIs who have their operations in order.

			<p><em>03 Feb 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I'm on the hunt for new ways to deploy attractive, interactive API documentation, from machine readable API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint. I am advocating for the development of new approaches to deploy UI documentation, and part of this showcasing what I find along the way.
In the spotlight today is Aglio, which they describe as:
An API Blueprint renderer that supports multiple themes and outputs static HTML that can be served by any web host. API Blueprint is a Markdown-based document format that lets you write API descriptions and documentation in a simple and straightforward way.

Aglio is significant because it is driven from the machine readable format API Blueprint, and produces static HTML that can be served up anywhere, specifically on Github or Amazon S3 deployed using Jekyll. Additionally it just makes your document simple, easy to follow, and just damn sexy.
I&rsquo;d love to see a Swagger generated version of Aglio, allowing you to deploy the attractive API documentation from both Swagger or API Blueprint. If more API documentation looked like Aglio, I would be a seriously happy camper.
