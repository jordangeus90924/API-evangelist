{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just reading a post at Mindtouch on having conditional documentation using MindTouch TCS.MindTouch TCS is a social knowledge-base, that can be used in building help systems and support communities.The post made me think about the API space and smart API documentation like Posterous, and Masherys new I/O docs for APIs.These are all approaches to making documentation more intelligent and personalized to whoever is reading the documentation.Masherys I/O docs, and smart API documentation allow developers to make API calls from within the documentation, making learning about APIs more interactive.</p>
