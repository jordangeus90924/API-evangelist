<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/07/24/first-handful-of-lessons-using-my-google-sheet-github-approach/">I’m working on a number of API courses and lessons lately</a>. Some of these are API 101 courses, while others are more advanced courses for the seasoned API provider, and consumer. As I think about what is needed when it comes to classes and workshops across the API sector, I’m considering doing an API Kindergarten series, where business and IT leaders can learn the basics of doing business with APIs.</p>

<p>The curriculum for the API kindergarten program include hands on lessons on how to play nicely, get along with others, the importance of sharing, and helping them learn the important soft skills like not shitting your pants. I’m always surprised at the lack of basic skills by company, organizational, institutional, and government leadership when it comes to the essentials of why APIs work, and think a little primer on things might help some realize they shouldn’t be doing APIs in the first place, or maybe prevent some major crisis down the road.</p>

<p>The number of folks who tell me directly that they are all in on this API thing, yet when it comes to practice clearly are not has grown significantly in 2017. I feel like we need a whole series or curriculum to help make sure business and IT leadership is up for the challenge is desperately needed. Just wait, until I begin working on my sex edit course for the middle schoolers, where we teach them about safely integrating, and what is appropriate API behavior, and what is not. Honestly, I could spend days finding equivalences between the real world and doing APIs (not real world) and creating classes around them–fun stuff!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/08/15/which-platforms-have-control-over-the-conversations-around-their-bots/">Which Platforms Have Control Over The Conversation Around Their Bots</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2017</span>
        <p>I spend a lot of time monitoring API platforms, thinking about different ways of identifying which ones are taking control of the conversation around how their platforms operate. One example of this out in the wild can be found when it comes to bots, by doing a quick look at which of the major bot platforms own the conversation around this automation going on via their platforms.</p>

<p>First you take a look at Twitter, by doing a quick Google search for Twitter Bots:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bots/bots-twitter-search.png" align="center" width="65%" /></p>

<p>Then you take a look at Facebook, by doing a quick Google search for Facebook Bots:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bots/bots-facebook-search.png" align="center" width="65%" /></p>

<p>Finally take a look at Slack, by doing a quick Google search for Slack Bots:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bots/bots-slack-search.png" align="center" width="65%" /></p>

<p>It is pretty clear who owns the conversation when it comes to bots on their platform. While Twitter and Facebook both have information and guidance about doing bots they do not own the conversation like Slack does. Something that is reflected in the search engine placement. It is also something that sets the tone of the conversation that is going on within the community, and defines the types of bots that will emerge on the platform.</p>

<p>As I’ve said before, if you have a web or mobile property online today, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/07/11/either-you-own-the-conversation-around-your-apis-or-someone-else-will/">you need to be owning the conversation around your API or someone eventually will own it for you</a>. The same comes to automation around your platform, and the introduction of bots, and automated users, traffic, advertising, and other aspects of doing business online today. Honestly, I wouldn’t want to be in the business of running a platform these days. It is why I work so hard to dominate and own my own presence, just so that I can beat back what is said about me, and own the conversation on at least Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Github.</p>

<p>Seems like to me, if you are going to enable automation on your platform via APIs, it should be something that you own completely, and make sure you provide some pretty strong guidance and direction.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/08/15/elastic-search-security-apis/">The ElasticSearch Security APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api.html"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/elastic-search/elasticsearch-security-apis.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I was looking <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api.html">at the set of security APIs over at Elasticsearch</a> as I was diving into my API security research recently. I thought the areas they provide security APIs for the search platform was worth noting and including in not just my API security research, but also <a href="http://search.apievangelist.com">search</a>, deployment, and probably overlap with <a href="http://authentication.apievangelist.com">my authentication research</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Authenticate API</strong> - The Authenticate API enables you to submit a request with a basic auth header to authenticate a user and retrieve information about the authenticated user.</li>
  <li><strong>Clear Cache API</strong> - The Clear Cache API evicts users from the user cache. You can completely clear the cache or evict specific users.</li>
  <li><strong>User Management APIs</strong> - The user API enables you to create, read, update, and delete users from the native realm. These users are commonly referred to as native users.</li>
  <li><strong>Role Management APIs</strong> - The Roles API enables you to add, remove, and retrieve roles in the native realm. To use this API, you must have at least the manage_security cluster privilege.</li>
  <li><strong>Role Mapping APIs</strong> - The Role Mapping API enables you to add, remove, and retrieve role-mappings. To use this API, you must have at least the manage_security cluster privilege.</li>
  <li><strong>Privilege APIs</strong> - The has_privileges API allows you to determine whether the logged in user has a specified list of privileges.</li>
  <li><strong>Token Management APIs</strong> - The token API enables you to create and invalidate bearer tokens for access without requiring basic authentication. The get token API takes the same parameters as a typical OAuth 2.0 token API except for the use of a JSON request body.</li>
</ul>

<p>Come to think of it, I’ll add this to my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management research</a> as well. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/adding-four-new-building-building-blocks-providing-an-api-management-api-blueprint/">Much of this overlaps with what should be a common set of API management services as well</a>. Like much of my research, there are many different dimensions to my API security research. I’m looking to see how API providers are securing their APIs, as well as how service providers are selling security services to APIs providers. I’m also keen on aggregating common API design patterns for security APIs, and quantity how they overlap with other stops along the API lifecycle.</p>

<p>While the cache API is pretty closely aligned with delivering a search API, I think all of these APIs provide a potential building block to think about when you are deploying any API, and represents the Venn diagram that is API authentication, management, and security. I’m going through the rest of the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch</a> platform looking for interesting approaches to ensuring their search solutions are secure. I don’t feel like there are any search specific characteristics of API security that I will need to include in my final API security industry guide, but Elasticsearch’s approach has re-enforced some of the existing security building blocks I already had on my list.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/progrium/web-hooks-and-the-programmable-world-of-tomorrow-presentation/21-REST_Hooksrest_and_web_hooks"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/webhooks/RESTHooks.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I am getting to work on a base set of webhook specification for <a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">my human services data API work</a>, and I wanted to take a fresh drive through a handful of the leading APIs I’m tracking on. I’m needing to make some recommendations regarding how human services data APIs should be pushing information via APIs, as we as providing APIs. Webhooks are fascinating to me because they really are just APIs in reverse. Webhooks are just an API request, where the target URL is a variable, allowing an API call to be made from a platform, to any target URL, on an triggering events, or on a schedule as a job.</p>

<p>Here are six of the API providers I took a look at while doing this webhook research:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developer.box.com/v2.0/docs/getting-started-with-webhooks-v2"><strong>Box</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="[https://gumroad.com/webhooks"><strong>Gumroad</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.venmo.com/docs/webhooks"><strong>Venmo</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/"><strong>Github</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks"><strong>Stripe</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks"><strong>Slack</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>All of these API providers offer webhooks, allowing developers to create an API call that will be fired off when a specific event occurs. These events are usually tied to a specific object. Box is documents. Github is a repository. Stripe is a payment. With human services it will be an organization, location, or service. There are a handful of key concepts at play when it comes to webhooks, making them an important part of the equation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Object</strong> - The object in which an event is occurring. For this project it is organizations, locations, services, contacts, and potentially other elements of API operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Events</strong>  - This is a list of events that can occur against all the objects that will trigger the execution of a webhook.</li>
  <li><strong>Target</strong> - The URL of the webhook. This is the variable of the outgoing API call, allowing them to be defined by API consumers, nd executed by the API provider.</li>
  <li><strong>Fat</strong> - The webhook will carry a payload, submitting a predefined schema, usually of the associated object to the target.</li>
  <li><strong>Ping</strong> - The webhook does not carry a payload, simply pinging the target of a webhook, letting API consumers know an even has occurred.</li>
  <li><strong>Status</strong> - The ability to identify the status of a webhook.</li>
  <li><strong>Errors</strong> - The errors that should be returned as part of webhook execution, and shared as it’s status.</li>
  <li><strong>Retries</strong> - Allowing for webhook execution to be replayed, executing a specific event that occurred in the past.</li>
  <li><strong>Signatures</strong> - Allowing for the signature of each webhook request to be verified for security and integrity purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>Test</strong> - Enable API cnosumers to test a webhook and see if it will work, sending over real or sample data.</li>
  <li><strong>History</strong> - Providing a complete history of webhook execution for API consumers to search, browse, and review.</li>
</ul>

<p>The external focus, and their event based nature are the most notable characteristics of a webhook, but it is the transactional nature of their supporting systems that seem to make them such a utility that can help alleviate the load on APIs. There are a number of other characteristics of webhooks, but this gets at the core of what they do, and provide me with what I need to move my human services API conversations forward. I’m looking to have a handful of examples of webhook implementations for well-known API platforms to share with folks, and begin setting the stage for an initial API design and definition for a human services webhook implementation, based upon common practices already in use.</p>

<p>I find webhooks interesting because are not a standard, and there really aren’t much in the way of best practices. Just some common examples of how they are used by existing API providers. Webhooks are just APIs. It is just the target URL that is variable, and the objects and events that can be unique to each API platform. In human services implementations I don’t just see webhooks as being about making API calls to other applications. I see webhooks as something that can satisfy pushing of data between many different API implementations, beginning to set the stage for interoperability between hundreds or even thousands of human service providers, pushing and pulling data as needed, and prescribed by each API provider. Allowing human service providers to speak a common language and seamlessly share information across a variety of partnerships. Getting closer to Greg Bloom’s vision, the creator of <a href="http://openreferral.org">Open Referral</a>, and the person behind the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS), for how all of this should be working.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/cargo-ship-zoomed-in-on-sea_light_dali.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>Part of the feedback I’ve received from <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">the Human Services Data API (HSDA) evolution from v1.0 to v1.1</a> was that the API didn’t allow for volume or bulk GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE. This was intentionally in the incremental release which focused on just making sure the API reflected 100% of the surface are for the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS). I wanted to separate out the needs of bulk API consumers, so that I could think about it separately from the more simple, micro-use integrations the default Human Services Data API would accommodate. I don’t want the industrial grade needs of database and system administrators overriding the simple access needs of other individual API consumers.</p>

<p>To kick off my human services bulk API definition I wanted to spend some time looking at other bulk implementations from a handful of leading providers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developers.intercom.com/v2.0/page/bulk-api-overview">Intercom</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html">ElasticSearch</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/page/File:Bulk_overview.png">SalesForce</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.diffbot.com/dev/docs/bulk/">Diffbot</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As I went through these implementations, and searched through Stack Overflow about bulk HTTP POSTs, I really didn’t see much difference on the technical front. Bulk APIs are primarily about acknowledging heavy duty data consumption, and primarily used HTTP POST for allowing the submission of either a) large individual POST, or b) large number of POST. Technically there isn’t much to them, where you start finding the nuance of bulk APIs over regular APIs is in the process surrounding the API implementation, things like having tasks, jobs, history, notifications, webhooks, email, and logging. Meaning there is just a lot more process and expectation around these APIs, which also most likely translates into more robust background architecture, and rules regarding the process involved with access.</p>

<p>Bulk APIs seem more about a separation of concerns. Bulk GET and POSTs require more infrastructure, and to do it properly you need process, and checks and balances to make sure a bulk operation is successfully executed, and there is sufficient history, notifications, and other events around bulk transactions. I’d say that bulk API operations should always be approached as a separate concern from the more mainstream web, mobile, single page application, embeddable, and spreadsheet applications. Providing a separate API subdomain, or paths allowing for the separation of infrastructure concerns, to make sure the API meets the availability concerns of both API provider and consumer. Next, I’ll spend some more time mapping out the task or job oriented structure of bulk APIs, but also for other API operations, to help make sure I do not reinvent the wheel when it comes to the design of my bulk API operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/algo-microservices.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p><a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">The Human Services Data API I have been working on is about defining a set of API paths for working with organizations, locations, and services that are delivering human services in cities around the world</a>. As I’m working to evolve the OpenAPI for the Human Services Data API (HSDA), I’m constantly mindful of bloat, unnecessary expansion of features, and always working to separate things by concern. My thoughts have evolved this due to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/11/a-hack-day-event-to-help-the-link-sf-app-speak-human-services-data-specification/">a hackathon I attended this week in San Francisco where a team at Optmizely worked to decouple an existing human services application from its backend and help teach it to speak Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a>–allowing it to speak a common language around the services that us humans depend on daily.</p>

<p>As the hackathon team was decoupling the single page application (React) from the API backend (Firebase) I took the API calls behind and published to Github as two JSON files. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/optimizely/linksf/master/core/sf_location.json">One of the files was locations, which contained 217 human service locations in San Francisco</a>, and metadata, which contained a handful of categories being used to organize and display the locations. In this situation, there is no notion of an organization, just 217 locations, offering human services across five categories. This legacy application, and forward engineering hackathon project was quickly becoming a microservices project, ironically it is a microservice project that was about delivering human services. ;-)</p>

<p>Looking at this unfolding project through a microservices lens, I needed to provide a single service. In the context <a href="https://link-sf.com/">of Link-SF</a>, the original project, I needed to offer a service that would deliver 217 locations where people can find human services in the areas of food, housing, hygiene, medical, and technology via an web, or mobile application. To help me achieve my goals I began to step through each of the steps of the lifecycle of any self-contained microservices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Github - Each of my services begins with a Github repository, <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/human-services-link/">so I created a new repo</a>.</li>
  <li>Definitions - I defined the service I wanted as <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/human-services-link/blob/master/_data/api-commons/openapi.yaml">an OpenAPI</a>.</li>
  <li>Design - I worked to keep the design of it as simple as I possibly can.</li>
  <li>DNS - I relied on Github’s DNS for this service, but may setup my own subdomain.</li>
  <li>Database - I published a YAML data file into the data folder for the Github repository, acting as the database for my service, leverage Github and Jekyll for helping me broker database connectivity.</li>
  <li>Deployment - I deployed <a href="https://adopta-agency.github.io/human-services-link/apis/locations.json">a simple static JSON API</a> driven from the locations YAML store.</li>
  <li>Management - I am using Github as the management platform for my API, helping me deploy and manage consumption of my service. I’m using the Github API as the programmatic layer for managing my service operations to help me continuously deploy and integrate with this service.</li>
  <li>Portal - I am using Github pages as the portal for my service, providing both human and programmatic access to my service, making human service locations more available.</li>
  <li>Documentation - I published static HTML, and Swagger UI documentation for the service.</li>
  <li>Support - I have published a support page, and will be providing support via Github issues, Twitter, and email.</li>
  <li>Communications - I have a blog published, and will be publishing the story of the service using the Jekyll CMS blogging solution.</li>
  <li>Caching - The API, portal, and all aspects of the service I’ve launched is being cached by Github, riding on the backs of their Content Delivery Network (CDN).</li>
  <li>Reliability - While Github has been known to have stability issues, it is still some of the most reliable way to host data and API driven services.</li>
  <li>Encryption - I’m leveraging the Github DNS, and using their encryption in transit by default. I will be using my own subdomain and encryption in the future.</li>
  <li>Security - I’m offloading platform security to Github. They have more resources than I do. I’m also looking to keep things more secure be keeping my services as static as possible.</li>
  <li>Testing - I am setting up a series of monitors to ensure the service stays available, and delivering expected data and promised schema. I will be publishing a status update and history page.</li>
  <li>Transparency - Everything involved with my service runs on Github, either as a public or private repository, with the entire lifecycle transparent publicly, or privately to whoever is given access to the repository using Github.</li>
  <li>Observability - The entire service runs on Github. The entire lifecycle is observable in the Github history, and leverage their existing infrastructure for identity and access management (IAM), and continuous integration and deployment.</li>
  <li>Discovery - There is an APIs.json available in the root of the project, providing a machine readable index of the schema, data, API, and other resources available via this service.</li>
  <li>Client - I’ve published an HTML / JavaScript client on the home page of the project, with an editor for managing the data, which leverages the Github API for reading and writing data to the services repository.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m calling my new service, born out of the Link-SF legacy application <a href="https://adopta-agency.github.io/human-services-link/">Human Services Link</a>. However, the only thing remaining of the Link-SF application is the data. I’ve forward engineered the schema, API, and web interface to all run on Github as a single, yet decoupled service. It is a reduction of the overall Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) schema, focusing in on just providing services at a handful of locations, reducing complexity and scope, to deliver a specific service–do one thing and do it well. I will be launching an Amazon EC2, and containerized version of this human services microservice, but I wanted to look at this one incarnation of it though the microservices lens. Sure, its not your classic microservices definition, but I think it holds up to a microservices test, it just makes some different architectural choices than the rest of the community might have made.</p>

<p>My human services microservice definition solves a single problem, for a specific type of end-user. It was originally geographically limited to San Francisco, but with with this evolution I’ve made sure there is a state/province field, as well as country, so that solution can be deployed for any city. I want the compute, database, DNS, API, portal, docs, and UI elements and admin tools to all be self contained for the delivery of a single microservice, but I wanted it all forkable, so you could launch this service over and over, in any city around the globe. There is still a lot of work to be done on this project before it is ready for prime time, but I’ve planted the seeds when it comes to delivering microservices in my world this way. I’m hoping it will be something I can’t ignore, and will keep pushing forward as part of my overall vision of how we can deliver sustainable API driven services.</p>

<p>I really like the static nature of this approach. I really like the forkability of this approach, and how you can use Github to separate out concerns by organization. I really like how I can offload much of the operation of my backend to Github, including security, CDN, and scalability / reliability. It is definitely not a pattern everyone should be following when doing microservices, but it does provide a static forkable pattern that can really help keep services very focused and self contained, but available to work in service of a bigger architectural picture. I’ll keep playing around with this approach to delivering human service microservices, and see what I can push forward and make stick. I’m hoping it can providing a low coast way for cash strapped municipalities to better deliver up to date information about human services to their entire population.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/containership_dali_three.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/08/14/some-microservice-thoughts-around-my-human-services-api-work/">I’ve been looking at my human services API work through a microservices lens, triggered by the deployment of a reduced functionality version of the human services implementation I was working on this week</a>. I’m thinking a lot about the technical side of decoupling services using APIs, but I want to also take a moment and think about the business side of decomposing services, while also making sure they are deployed in a way that meets both the provider and consumer side of the business equation. My human services microservice implementation is in the public service, which is a space where the business conversation often seems to disappear behind closed doors, but in reality needs to be front and center with each investment (commit) made into any service.</p>

<p>Let’s take a moment to look at the monetization strategy and operational plan for my human service microservice. Yes, a public data microservice should have a monetization strategy and plan for operating and remaining sustainable. The goals for this type of microservice will be radically different than it would be for a commercial microservice, but it should have one all the same.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monetization - How am I evaluating the investment into this project alongside any value that is generated, which I can potentially capture or exchange some value for some money to keep going.
    <ul>
      <li>Acquisition - What did it take for me to acquire the data and skills necessary to make the deployment possible.</li>
      <li>Development - What time was invested in setting up the platform, developing the schema, data, definitions, code, and visual elements.</li>
      <li>Operations - What does it take to operate the service? Maintain it, answer questions, provide support, and other realities of providing an online service today.</li>
      <li>Direct Value - What are the direct benefits of having this service available to people looking for human services, or organizations looking to provide human services.</li>
      <li>Indirect Value - What are the indirect benefits of having this service available, like increased conversation around human services, or maybe traffic and awareness of the Open Referral organization.</li>
      <li>Partners - What partnership opportunities are actively being sought out, or will be opened up by having this service available.</li>
      <li>Reporting - What type of reporting is necessary to operate and monetize this service, from tracking page views to understanding who is integrated with the data, and consuming data via APIs, or possibly through continuous integration of the Github repository.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Plan - What is my plan for making this service available to the public, partners, or maybe internally use across my own projects.
    <ul>
      <li>Elements - My human services location API is designed to be publicly available, forkable, and reusable by anyone.</li>
      <li>Limits - There are no limits on how each human services microservice can be used, or forked and reused. Ideally, any implementation provides attribution, and acknowledges the source of framework or data, but there really are no rules.</li>
      <li>Metrics - I am measuring unique page views on each page, including of the machine readable YAML, JSON, and other formats. I’m also tracking on stars, forks, and commits for each service.</li>
      <li>Commercial - Providing a clear track for commercial vendors to understand that the project needs their support, and can be improved upon, and evolved through their underwriting and support.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I need to have a coherent snapshot of what I’ve invested into each of my service. I need to have a base plan for how I will be executing the business side of this service–even if it just making something available for free. There are two dimensions to this conversation: 1) My view as the creator of this service 2) The view of folks who fork and implement as a service. Both dimensions should have a monetization snapshot, and a plan for executing within this business snapshot. I need all of this decoupled from any other service I am offering, but ideally they all use a common set of reusable patterns, just like the technical aspects of my microservices effort.</p>

<p>Just like needing the compute, database, DNS, and other technical layers to be stable and scalable across my microservices, I need the costs associated with these elements predictable and affordable. I need to know what it costs to define, design, deploy, manage, and deprecate my services. I need to know the best path forward for making them public, keeping them private, and being honest with commercial partners about the value that is being generated, both directly and indirectly. I need a way to report my costs, and revenue across hundreds or thousands of these services. I need to be able to scale this both horizontally across many services, but also vertically for single services which get deployed over and over, reused and continuously integrate wherever they are needed using Github.</p>

<p>I’ll keep applying this model across my human services project. I’m thinking that I’m going to be developing a whole buffet of human service microservices that run a 100% on Github like this, but I am also playing around with other varietals that run on other popular cloud platforms as well. I’m not one to subscribe to any particular API dogma, I’m just looking to explore what is possible, and do all of it as cheaply as I possibly scan, growing the number of projects I’m able to tackle. Of course, none of this would be possible without my partners funding my work, and helping me connect the technical and business aspects of doing API Evangelist.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/aws-answers-icons.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>The discussion around whether or not you should be hosting your own questions and answers (QA) and frequently asked questions (FAQ) for your API has continued, with many of the leading API pioneers asserting responsibility over the operations of these important API resources. Amazon noticed that answers about their platform on Quora and Stack Exchange were usually out of date and often just plain wrong, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/">prompting them to launch their own QA solution</a>.</p>

<p>I have written about using API providers using Stack Overflow for may years now. It the last few years I’ve had my readers push back on this for a variety of reasons, from the Stack Overflow community being primarily a white male bro-fest, to finding things being unreliable, out of date, and often a pretty hostile and unfriendly place for people to try and learn about APIs. I’d say that I still use Stack Overflow for about 40% of my querying of API and programming related subjects, but since I’m a white male who has been doing software for 30 years, I’m a little more resistant to the bro-fest. But, I get it, and hear what  folks are saying, and get it is not always a suitable environment.</p>

<p>Going back and forth on this subject, I’m back in the camp where API providers should be investing in operating their own QA, FAQ, and support forums. It’s definitely requires a significant amount of investment, policing, and sometimes taking stances that are unpopular, but if you are in this for the long game, it will be worth it. After watching AWS for a decade, you can see how incorrect information about your API operations can really begin to become a liability, and you might want to keep a tighter grip on where your API consumers go look for their answers. An added bonus is that you also get to set the tone for the types of questions that get answered, and the inclusiveness that will exist across your FAQ, QA, and Support.</p>

<p>I really need to get my core API design guides like <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">definitions</a>, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">deployment</a>, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">management</a> out the door, because I need to diving into areas like support, and gather all my thoughts regarding how API providers should be approaching this critical layer of operations. I feel like support is one of the most defining characteristics of sustainable API providers, right up there with communications I’d say. I don’t care how good your API is technically, if you don’t have a solid approach to supporting and communicating with your API community, I’m guessing you won’t be around very long, or if you do survive, your platform will be something savvy API consumers steer clear of.</p>

<p>I was on a call the other day with a group of people who are in the trenches of organizations and companies working hard to deliver human services in cities around the country. We were meeting to kick of the design phase of a new type of API, and after they shared all their thoughts via project documentation, they were asking me to help identify examples of best practices from the space. The group felt they didn’t have the time, or the awareness of what is going on to be able to identify the best practices that already exist across the space.</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons I stay out of the weeds of individual projects. I may help define, design, and even shadow the deployment and management, but I work hard to avoid the tractor beam of ongoing projects so that I can pay attention to the bigger picture and help share stories about what I’m seeing. I feel like there should be people like me in each industry helping shine a light on, and aggregating of best practices when it comes to the API life cycle. There is just too much work to be done, and it helps to have folks who have domain expertise, not just lightly understanding what is going on across many sectors like I do.</p>

<p>I think it is fine for the sector to depend on API analysts like me, but I think that groups should also be investing in the time to pick up their heads up and pay attention to what else is going on when it comes to APIs in their industry. I understand that many groups are busy keeping systems operational, and dealing with real world problems, but dedicated reading of blogs, white papers, and tuning into social channels for other API providers is important as well. Each decision made on API design, deployment, and management should be established from time spent reading, and learning about other existing approaches–minimizing the amount of wheel reinvention that occurs.</p>

<p>The amount of time you invest in learning about other successful API providers will pay off in the amount of time it saves you when defining, designing, deploying, and managing an API. Sadly, it is one of those areas that some companies aren’t always equipped to measure the return on investment from something like this, resulting in many companies limiting the amount of time API developers spend reading blogs, and actively researching existing implementations, leading design patterns, and healthy API practices. If your boss is ever giving you grief about the amount of time you are spending on learning about other APIs, make sure and point them in my direction. I’m happy to help them understand why you don’t want to be reinventing the wheel when it comes to web APIs.</p>

        <p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-service-link-rel-03"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/erik-wilde/link-relation-types-for-web-services.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I have been reading through a number of specifications lately, trying to get more up to speed on what standards are available for me to choose from when designing APIs. Next up on my list is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-service-link-rel-03">Link Relation Types for Web Services</a>, by Erik Wilde. I wanted to take this informational specification and repost here on my site, partially because I find it easier to read, and the process of breaking things down and publishing as a posts helps me digest the specification and absorb more of what it contains.</p>

<p>I’m particularly interested in this one, because Erik captures what I’ve had in my head for APIs.json property types, but haven’t been able to always articulate as well as Erik does, let alone published as an official specification. I think his argument captures the challenge we face with mapping out the structure we have, and how we can balance the web with the API, making sure as much of it becomes machine readable as possible. I’ve grabbed the meat of Link Relation Types for Web Services and pasted here, so I can break down, and reference across my storytelling.</p>

<hr />

<ol>
  <li>Introduction<br />
One of the defining aspects of the Web is that it is possible to interact with Web resources without any prior knowledge of the specifics of the resource.  Following Web Architecture by using URIs, HTTP, and media types, the Web’s uniform interface allows interactions with resources without the more complex binding procedures of other approaches.</li>
</ol>

<p>Many resources on the Web are provided as part of a set of resources that are referred to as a “Web Service” or a “Web API”.  In many cases, these services or APIs are defined and managed as a whole, and it may be desirable for clients to be able to discover this service information.</p>

<p>Service information can be broadly separated into two categories: One category is primarily targeted for human users and often uses generic representations for human readable documents, such as HTML or PDF. The other category is structured information that follows some more formalized description model, and is primarily intended for consumption by machines, for example for tools and code libraries.</p>

<p>In the context of this memo, the human-oriented variant is referred to as “documentation”, and the machine-oriented variant is referred to as “description”.</p>

<p>These two categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as there are representations that have been proposed that are intended for both human consumption, and for interpretation by machine clients. In addition, a typical pattern for service documentation/description is that there is human-oriented high-level documentation that is intended to put a service in context and explain the general model, which is complemented by a machine-level description that is intended as a detailed technical description of the service.  These two resources could be interlinked, but since they are intended for different audiences, it can make sense to provide entry points for both of them.</p>

<p>This memo places no constraints on the specific representations used for either of those two categories.  It simply allows providers of aWeb service to make the documentation and/or the description of their services discoverable, and defines two link relations that serve that purpose.</p>

<p>In addition, this memo defines a link relation that allows providers of a Web service to link to a resource that represents status information about the service.  This information often represents operational information that allows service consumers to retrieve information about “service health” and related issues.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Terminology<br />
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,”SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Web Services<br />
“Web Services” or “Web APIs” (sometimes also referred to as “HTTP API” or “REST API”) are a way to expose information and services on the Web. Following the principles of Web architecture[ they expose URI-identified resources, which are then accessed and transferred using a specific representation.  Many services use representations that contain links, and often these links are typed links.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Using typed links, resources can identify relationship types to other resources.  RFC 5988 [RFC5988] establishes a framework of registered link relation types, which are identified by simple strings and registered in an IANA registry.  Any resource that supports typed links according to RFC 5988 can then use these identifiers to represent resource relationships on the Web without having to re-invent registered relation types.</p>

<p>In recent years, Web services as well as their documentation and description languages have gained popularity, due to the general popularity of the Web as a platform for providing information and services.  However, the design of documentation and description languages varies with a number of factors, such as the general application domain, the preferred application data model, and the preferred approach for exposing services.</p>

<p>This specification allows service providers to use a unified way to link to service documentation and/or description.  This link should not make any assumptions about the provided type of documentation and/or description, so that service providers can choose the ones that best fit their services and needs.</p>

<p>3.1.  Documenting Web Services<br />
In the context of this specification, “documentation” refers to information that is primarily intended for human consumption.Typical representations for this kind of documentation are HTML andPDF.</p>

<p>Documentation is often structured, but the exact kind of structure depends on the structure of the service that is documented, as well as on the specific way in which the documentation authors choose to document it.</p>

<p>3.2.  Describing Web Services<br />
In the context of this specification, “description” refers to information that is primarily intended for machine consumption.Typical representations for this are dictated by the technology underlying the service itself, which means that in today’s technology landscape, description formats exist that are based on XML, JSON, RDF, and a variety of other structured data models.  Also, in each of those technologies, there may be a variety of languages that a redefined to achieve the same general purpose of describing a Web service.</p>

<p>Descriptions are always structured, but the structuring principles depend on the nature of the described service.  For example, one of the earlier service description approaches, the Web ServicesDescription Language (WSDL), uses “operations” as its core concept, which are essentially identical to function calls, because the underlying model is based on that of the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) model.  Other description languages for non-RPC approaches to services will use different structuring approaches.</p>

<p>3.3.  Unified Documentation/Description<br />
If service providers use an approach where there is no distinction of service documentation Section 3.1 and service descriptionSection 3.2, then they may not feel the need to use two separate links.  In such a case, an alternative approach is to use the”service” link relation type, which has no indication of whether it links to documentation or description, and thus may be better fit if no such differentiation is required.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Link Relations for Web Services<br />
In order to allow Web services to represent the relation of individual resources to service documentation or description, this specification introduces and registers two new link relation types.</li>
</ol>

<p>4.1.  The service-doc Link Relation Type<br />
The “service-doc” link relation type is used to represent the fact that a resource is part of a bigger set of resources that are documented at a specific URI.  The target resource is expected to provide documentation that is primarily intended for human consumption.</p>

<p>4.2.  The service-desc Link Relation Type<br />
The “service-desc” link relation type is used to represent the fact that a resource is part of a bigger set of resources that are described at a specific URI.  The target resource is expected to provide a service description that is primarily intended for machine consumption.  In many cases, it is provided in a representation that is consumed by tools, code libraries, or similar components.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Web Service Status Resources<br />
Web services providing access to a set of resources often are hosted and operated in an environment for which status information may be available.  This information may be as simple as confirming that a service is operational, or may provide additional information about different aspects of a service, and/or a history of status information, possibly listing incidents and their resolution.</li>
</ol>

<p>The “status” link relation type can be used to link to such a status resource, allowing service consumers to retrieve status information about a Web service’s status.  Such a link may not be available from all resources provided by a Web service, but from key resources such as a Web service’s home resource.</p>

<p>This memo does not restrict the representation of a status resource in any way.  It may be primarily focused on human or machine consumption, or a combination of both.  It may be a simple “traffic light” indicator for service health, or a more sophisticated representation conveying more detailed information such as service subsystems and/or a status history.</p>

<ol>
  <li>IANA Considerations<br />
The link relation types below have been registered by IANA perSection 6.2.1 of RFC 5988 [RFC5988]:</li>
</ol>

<p>6.1.  Link Relation Type: service-doc<br /></p>

<p>Relation Name: service-doc<br />
   Description: Linking to service documentation that is primarily   intended for human<br /> consumption.<br />
   Reference: [[ This document ]]<br /></p>

<p>6.2.  Link Relation Type: service-desc<br /></p>

<p>Relation Name: service-desc<br />
   Description: Linking to service description that is primarily   intended for consumption by machines.<br />
   Reference: [[ This document ]]<br /></p>

<p>6.3.  Link Relation Type: status<br /></p>

<p>Relation Name: status<br />
   Description: Linking to a resource that represents the status of a   Web service or API.<br />
   Reference: [[ This document ]]<br /></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Adding Some Of My Own Thoughts Beyond The Specification</strong>
This specification provides a more coherent service-doc, and service-desc that I think we did with humanURL, and support for multiple API definition formats (swagger, api blueprint, raml) as properties for any API. This specification provides a clear solution for human consumption, as well as one intended for consumption by machines. Another interesting link relation it provides is status, helping articulate the current state of an API.</p>

<p>It makes me happy to see this specification pushing forward and formalizing the conversation. I see the evolution of link relations for APIs as an important part of the API discovery and definition conversations in coming years. Processing this specification has <a href="https://github.com/apis-json/api-json/issues">helped jumpstart some conversation around APIs.json</a>, as well as other specifications like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/03/api-discovery-using-json-home/">JSON Home</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/03/microservice-discovery-using-pivio/">Pivio</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://api.data.gov/about/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-data-gov/9299911959_bdc195fb56_o.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I’m going to borrow, modify, and improve on the content from <a href="https://api.data.gov">api.data.gov</a>, because it is an important effort I want my readers to be aware of, because I want more of them to help apply educate other federal agencies regarding why it is a good idea to bake api.data.gov into their API operations, and help apply pressure until EVERY federal agency is up and running using a common API management layer.</p>

<p>Ok, so what is <a href="https://api.data.gov">api.data.gov</a>? api.data.gov is a free API management service for federal agencies. Our aim is to make it easier for you to release and manage your APIs. api.data.gov acts as a layer above your existing APIs. It transparently adds extra functionality to your APIs and helps deal with some of the repetitive parts of managing APIs.</p>

<p>Here are the features of api.data.gov:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You’re in control: You still have complete control of building and hosting your APIs however you like.</li>
  <li>No changes required: No changes are required to your API, but when it’s accessed through api.data.gov, we’ll transparently add features and handle the boring stuff.</li>
  <li>Focus on the APIs: You’re freed from worrying about things like API keys, rate limiting, and gathering usage stats, so you can focus on building the next great API.</li>
  <li>Make it easy for your users: By providing a standard entry point to participating APIs, it’s easier for developers to explore and use APIs across the federal government.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://api.data.gov">api.data.gov</a> handles the API keys for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>API key signup: It’s quick and easy for users to signup for an API key and start using it immediately.</li>
  <li>Shared across services: Users can reuse their API key across all participating api.data.gov APIs.</li>
  <li>No coding required: No code changes are required to your API. If your API is being hit through api.data.gov, you can simply assume it’s from a valid user.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://api.data.gov">api.data.gov</a> tracks all the traffic to your API and give you tools to easily analyze it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Demonstrate value: Understand how your API is being used so you can gauge the value and success of your APIs.</li>
  <li>Visualize usage and trends: View graphs of the overall usage trends for your APIs.</li>
  <li>Flexible querying: Drill down into the stats based on any criteria. Find out how much traffic individual users are generating, or answer more complex questions about aggregate usage.</li>
  <li>Monitor API performance: We gather metrics on the speed of your API, so you can keep an eye on how your API is performing.</li>
  <li>No coding required: No code changes are required to your API. If your API is being hit through api.data.gov, we can take care of logging the necessary details.
Documentation</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://api.data.gov">api.data.gov</a> helps with publishing documentation for your API:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hosted or linked: We can host the documentation of your API, or, if you already have your own developer portal, we can simply link to it.</li>
  <li>One stop shop: As more agencies add APIs to api.data.gov, users will be able to discover and explore more government APIs all at one destination.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://api.data.gov">api.data.gov</a> helps you rate limit because you might not want to allow all users to have uncontrolled access to your APIs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prevent abuse: Your API servers won’t see traffic from users exceeding their limits, preventing additional load on your servers.</li>
  <li>Per user limits: Individual users can be given higher or lower rate limits.</li>
  <li>No coding required: No code changes are required to your API. If your API is being hit, you can simply assume it’s from a user that hasn’t exceeded their rate limits.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://api.data.gov">api.data.gov</a> is powered by the open source project API Umbrella. You can contribute to the development of this platform, or setup your own instance and run the entire stack yourself. If you’re interested in exploring any of this for your APIs, <a href="https://api.data.gov/contact/#apidatagov-service-contact">please contact us</a>. In general, it’s easy to take any existing API your agency has (or is in the process of building) and put api.data.gov in front of it. This can be an easy way to get started and see what type of functionality api.data.gov might provide for your API.</p>

<p><a href="https://api.data.gov">api.data.gov</a> is all about consistent API management across federal government, which means developers will be able to get at government data, content, and algorithms more efficiently, and integrate them into web, mobile, and other applications. We need more government agencies to be doing this, taking advantage of api.data.gov and get to work developing an awareness around who is consuming their API resources. Eventually API management will be how government agencies will be generating revenue on top  of valuable API resources, charging commercial users enough so that each agency can cover the costs of operations, and hopefully make more of an investment in the resources they are making available.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/03/api-discovery-using-json-home/">I have been studying JSON Home</a>, trying to understand how it sizes up to <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/03/microservice-discovery-using-pivio/">other formats I’m tracking on like Pivio</a>. JSON Home has a number of interesting features, and I thought one of their examples was also interesting, and was relevant to <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com/">my API embeddable research</a>. In this example, JSON Home was describing a widget that was putting an API to use as part of its operation.</p>

<p>Here is the snippet from the JSON Home example, providing all details of how it works:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/40fabbb3133ddd1c65249dfdc87999cd.js"></script>

<p>JSON Home seems very action oriented. Everything about the format leads you towards taking some sort of API driven action, something that makes a lot of sense when it comes to widgets and other embeddables. I could see JSON Home being used as some sort of definition for button or widget generation and building tooling, providing a machine readable definition for the embeddable tool, and what is possible with the API(s) behind.</p>

<p>I’ve been working towards embeddable directories and API stacks using APIs.json, providing distributed and embeddable tooling that API providers and consumers can publish anywhere. I will be spending more time thinking about how this world of API discovery can overlap with the world of API embeddables, providing not just a directory of buttons, badges, and widgets, but one that describes what is possible when you engage with any embeddable tool. I’m beginning to see JSON Home similar to how I see Postman Collections, something that is closer to runtime, or at least deploy time. Where APIs.json is much more about indexing, search, and discovery–maybe some detail about where the widgets are, or maybe more detail about what embeddable resources are available.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/open-referral/optimizely/optimizely-hackathon.JPG" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I went up to San Francisco on Wednesday to participate in a social good hack day at <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/">Optimizely</a>. They held their event at their downtown offices, where 20+ employees showed up to hack on some social good projects. Open Referral and our partner <a href="https://www.benetech.org/">Benetech</a> had suggested Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) as a possible project, which resulted in us being one of the hack projects for the event.</p>

<p>The Open Referral Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) team consisted of five Optimizely developers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Derek Hammond - Software Engineer</li>
  <li>Michael Fields - Software Engineer</li>
  <li>Zachary Power - Software Engineering Intern</li>
  <li>Quinton Dang - Software Engineer</li>
  <li>Asa Schachar - Engineering Manager</li>
</ul>

<p>The overall strength of the team leaned toward being front-end web and mobile developers, so we decided <a href="https://github.com/zendesk/linksf">to “forward engineer” the Link-SF application</a>, which provides a simple web or mobile application to help folks find a variety of human services in a handful of categories like food, housing, hygiene, medical, and technology. Link-SF is an ongoing collaboration between the <a href="http://www.tenderlointechnologylab.org/">Tenderloin Technology Lab</a> and <a href="http://www.zendesk.com/">Zendesk, Inc.</a>, and we wanted to help contribute to their work, while also making the application potentially deployable by other cities and regions.</p>

<p>Once the team got to work on the project they identified that we could get at the data behind the SF application. The team decide they would forward engineer the dataset, the API, and the UI for the web and mobile application, making it all speak <a href="https://github.com/openreferral/specification">Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a>–here is what they did:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Took the Link-SF datasets and saved as a single JSON file.</li>
  <li>Converted the JSON schema to use HSDS – the changes weren’t significant.</li>
  <li>Made it so that the app reads <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/optimizely/linksf/master/core/sf_location.json">location data from a Github repository</a> (you can change this to your url)</li>
  <li>Updated the taxonomy fetch to use the new data</li>
  <li>Ensured the UI worked with the new data</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/optimizely/linksf">You can find the project in an Optimizely Github repository</a>, which they are going to invest some more time into cleaning up this week–so don’t judge! ;-) If you want to run our app locally, <a href="https://github.com/optimizely/linksf/blob/master/docs/SETUP.md">you can save a file as <code class="highlighter-rouge">config.js</code>and follow the instructions on the setup page</a>. I am going to play with the application some more, and wait for them to clean up the page before we add the project to our official open source Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) solutions. Adding another HSDS compliant tool that any city, county, or other organization could deploy for their own purposes.</p>

<p>We didn’t have much time for the hackathon. It went from 2:30 PM to 8:30 PM, and I was impressed what the team was able to get done. I like their hack which used Github as a backend, and the speed at which they were able to work together to fork the application and make working using HSDS. It provides an interesting open source blueprint that other cities could also fork, and implement with their own localized datasets. Their work shows what is possible when you decouple the backend API (or JSON file) from the front-end application, and utilize a common schema and API definition. It transforms the application from a single use application into a multi-use application that can be used over and over again.</p>

<p>Thank you to <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/">Optimizely</a> for putting on the hackathon. Thank you to <a href="https://www.benetech.org/">Benetech</a> for making the event happen. Thank you to the five developers who help moved the HSDS conversation forward. Once the Github repository gets cleaned up, I will spend some time playing with the application, and publish a follow-up story. I’d like to make the project push button deployable, so that organizations could launch a new instance of Link-[Any City] for low or no cost. We have another hackathon coming up in September on the east coast, and I learned a lot at this one about what I should have ready when it comes to help hackers be successful in the short time we have. It has been a while since I’ve attended a hackathon, and forgot how they can be a good vehicle for moving projects forward–at least the social good type of event. ;-)</p>

<p>I have been slowly evolving my network of websites in 2017, overhauling the look of them, as well as how they function. I am investing cycles into pushing as much of my infrastructure towards being as static as possible, minimizing my usage of JavaScript wherever I can. I am still using a significant amount of JavaScript libraries across my sites for a variety of use cases, but whenever I can, I am looking to kill my JavaScript or backend dependencies, and reduce the opportunity for any tracking and surveillance.</p>

<p>While I still keep Google Analytics on my primary API Evangelist sites, as my revenue depends on it, whenever possible I keep personal projects without any JavaScript tracking mechanisms. Instead of JavaScript I am defaulting to image logging using Amazon S3. Most of my sites tend to have some sort of header image, which I store in a common public bucket on Amazon S3, all I have to do is turn on logging, and then get at logging details via the Amazon S3 API. Of course, images get cached within a user’s browser, but the GET for my images still gives me a pretty good set of numbers to work with. I’m not concerned with too much detail, I just generally want to understand the scope of traffic a project is getting, and whether it is 5, 50, 500, 5,000, or 50,000 visitors.</p>

<p>My two primary CDNs are Amazon S3 and Github. I’m trying to pull together a base strategy for monitoring activity across my digital footprint. My business presence is very different than my personal presence, but with some of my personal writing, photography, and other creations I still like to keep a finger on the pulse of what is happening. I am just looking to minimize the data gathering and surveillance I am participating in these days. Keeping my personal and business websites static, and with a minimum footprint is increasingly important to me. I find that a minimum viable static digital footprint protects my interests, maximize my control over my work, and minimizes the impact to my readers and customers.</p>

<p>The main reason that I tend to rail against API specific patents is that much of what I see being locks up reflects the parts and pieces that are making the web work. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/12/i-just-cannot-get-behind-api-patents-especially-when-they-apply-to-http-and-hypermedia/">I see things like hypermedia, and other concepts that are inherently about sharing, collaboration, and reuse</a>–something that should never be patented. This concept applies to other patents I’m seeing, but rather than being about the web, it is about trust, and sharing of information. Things that shouldn’t be locked up, and exist within realms where the concept of patents actually hurt the web and APIs.</p>

<p>Today’s patent is out of Amazon, who are prolific patenters of web and API concepts. This one though is about <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/9325732">the sharing of security threat sharing</a>. Outlining something that should be commonplace on the web.</p>

<p>Title -  <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/9325732">Computer security threat sharing</a><br />
Number - 09325732<br />
Owner - Amazon Technologies, Inc.<br />
Abstract -  A computer security threat sharing technology is described. A computer security threat is recognized at an organization. A partner network graph is queried for security nodes connected to a first security node representing the organization. The first security node is connected to at least a second security node representing a trusted security partner of the organization. The second security node is associated with identification information. The computer security threat recognized by the organization is communicated to the trusted security partner using the identification information associated with the second security node.<br /></p>

<p>I’m sorry. I just do not see this as unique, original, or remotely a concept that should be patentable. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/08/patent-web-of-trust-management-in-a-distributed-system/">Similar to a previous patent I wrote about on trust</a>, I just don’t think that sharing of security information needs to be locked up. The USPTO should recognize this. I feel like this type of patent shows how broken the patent process is, and how distorted company’s views on what is a patentable idea. Honestly, these types of patents feel lazy to me, and lack any creativity, skills, or sensible view of how the web works.</p>

<p>I feel like I should start rating these patents with some sort of Rotten Tomato score, and start giving companies some sort of patent ranking for their portfolio. Something that encompasses the scope, lack of creativity, originality, and damaging effects of the patent. This reminds me that I need to finish my work pulling court cases <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/">from the Court Listener API</a>, and index them for any companies, and their patent portfolios. Ultimately this is where the real damage to APIs and the web will play out, similar to <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/05/10/where-will-your-api-stand-in-the-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-debate/">the Oracle vs. Google API copyright affair</a>, but I will keep sharing stories of these ridiculous patents, and maybe even start ranking them all by how much they stink.</p>

<p>A regular thing I hear from folks when we are having conversations about the API lifecycle, is that I focus on public APIs, and they are more interested in private APIs. Each time I hear this I try to take time and assess which parts of my public API research wouldn’t apply to internal APIs. You wouldn’t publish your APIs to pubic API search engines like APIs.io or ProgrammableWeb, and maybe not evangelizing your APIs at hackathons, but I’d say 90% of what I study is applicable to internal APIs, as well as publicly available APIs.</p>

<p>With internal APIs, or private network partner APIs you still need a portal, documentation, SDKs, support mechanisms, and communication and feedback loops. Sure, how you use the common building blocks of API operations that I track on will vary between private and public APIs, but this shifts from industry to industry, and API to API as well–it isn’t just a public vs. private thing. I would say that 75% of my API industry research is derived from public API operations–it is just easier to access, and honestly more interesting to cover than private ones. The other 25% of internal API conversation I’m having, always benefit from thinking through the common API building blocks of public APIs, looking for ways they can be more successful with internal and partner APIs.</p>

<p>I’d say that a significant part of the mindshare for the microservices philosophy is internally focused. I think this is something that will come back to hurt some implementations, cutting out many of the mechanisms and common elements required in a successful API formula. Things like portals, documentations, SDKs, testing, monitoring, discovery, support, communications all contribute to an API working, or not working. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. I’m not convinced that there is any true separation in public vs private APIs, and there remains to be a great deal we can learn from public API providers, and put to work across internal operations, and with our most trusted partners.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-bot-api.png" align="right" width="25%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>

<p>I’m looking into how to make <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com">API security</a> more transparent and observable lately, and looking for examples of companies, institutions, organizations, politicians, and the government are calling for observability into wherever APIs are impacting our world. Today’s example comes out of <a href="http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-cybersecurity">POLITICO’s Morning Cybersecurity email newsletter</a>, which has become an amazing source of daily information for me, regarding transparency around the take down of bot networks.</p>

<p><em>“If private companies cooperate with government agencies - for example, in the takedown of botnets using the companies’ infrastructure - they should do so as publicly as possible, <a href="https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/cdt-ntia-nistcommentsbotnetsfinal.pdf">argued the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology</a> . “One upside to compulsory powers is that they presumptively become public eventually, and are usually overseen by judges or the legislative branch,” CDT argued in its filing. “Voluntary efforts run the risk of operating in the dark and obscuring a level of coordination that would be offensive to the general public. It is imperative that private actors do not evolve into state actors without all the attendant oversight and accountability that comes with the latter.”</em></p>

<p>I’ve been tracking on the transparency statements and initiatives of all the API platforms. At some point I’m going to assemble the common building blocks of what is needed for executing platform transparency, and I will be including these asks of the federal government. As the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology states this relationship between the public and private sector when it comes to platform surveillance needs to be more transparent and observable in all forms. Bots, IoT, and the negative impacts of API automation needs to be included in the transparency disclosure stack. If the government is working with platform to discover, surveil, or shutdown bot networks there should be some point in which operations should be shared, including the details of what was done.</p>

<p>We need platform <a href="http://transparency.apievangelist.com">transparency</a> and <a href="http://observability.apievangelist.com">observability</a> at the public and private sector layer of engagement. Sure, this sharing of information would be time sensitive, respecting any investigations and laws, but if private sector infrastructure is being used to surveil and shut down U.S. citizens there should be an accessible, audit-able log for this activity. Of course it should also have an API allowing auditors and researchers to get all relevant information. Bots are just one layer of the API security research I’m doing, and the overlap in the bot world when it comes to API transparency, observability, and security is an increasingly significant vector when it comes to policing, <a href="http://surveillance.apievangelist.com">surveillance</a>, but also when it comes to protecting the privacy and safety of platform people (citizens).</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-data/tender-notice/PW-17-00786791"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/canada/open-by-default-portal-procurement.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I was reading <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-data/tender-notice/PW-17-00786791">the Open by Default Portal Procurement Pilot for the Treasury Board of Canada</a>, where section 6, Licensing states: “To support the objectives of the open government initiative, the Solution must be open source and licensed in accordance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology License (“MIT License”). Under the resulting contract, the Contractor will be required to deposit the Solution’s source code on the GitHub platform (https://github.com) – under the MIT License.”</p>

<p>This just seems like the way it should be for all government technology solutions. I’ve heard the naysayers in federal government say that proprietary software is the best route, but if it drives public infrastructure, in my opinion the code should be publicly available in this way. Honestly, code should be deployed at regular intervals throughout the development and deployment process, opening up the code to QA and security audits by the public, and 3rd parties. I hope this approach evolves into more of a continuous deployment and integration workflow when it comes to delivering software in government, where vendors have to plugin, open up their delivery cycles to more scrutiny, and leverage Github as the center of each procurement step from start to finish. Heck, let’s connect payments to each stop along the way.</p>

<p>I’m a proponent of this not just to make the delivery of government software more observable and accountable. I want this process out in the open to help other agencies learn from the journey. Tune into the process, and maybe reuse, build upon, and evolve existing solutions as part of their operations. I will keep an eye on what is going on up in Canada, when it comes to requiring vendors publish code to Github. I also know there are similar efforts in the U.S. and other countries which I’ll also start scratching at and learning more about. It is definitely a healthy pattern I’d like to see more of, and I will continue to invest time shining a light on any government taking a lead like Canada is.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/open-source-threat-intel-gosint"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/GOSINT/gosint.gif" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I was reading about GOSINT, <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/open-source-threat-intel-gosint">the open source intelligence gathering and processing framework over at Cisco</a>. “GOSINT allows a security analyst to collect and standardize structured and unstructured threat intelligence. Applying threat intelligence to security operations enriches alert data with additional confidence, context, and co-occurrence. This means that you are applying research from third parties to your event data to identify similar, or identical, indicators of malicious behavior.” The framework is written in Go, with a front-end in JavaScript frontend, and usage of APIs as threat intelligence sources.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ciscocsirt/gosint">When you look at configuration section on the README for GOSINT</a>, you’ll see information for setting up threat intelligence feeds, including Twitter API, <a href="https://otx.alienvault.com/api/">Alien Vault the Open Threat Community API</a>, <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/">VirusTotal API</a>, and <a href="https://crits.github.io/">the Collaborative Research Into Threats (CRITS)</a>.  GOSINT acts as an API aggregator for a variety of threat information, which then allows you to scour the information for threat indicators, which you can evolve over time, providing a pretty interesting model for not just threat information sharing, but also API driven aggregation, curation and sharing.</p>

<p>GOSINT also has the notion of behaving as a “transfer station”, where you can export refined data as CSV or CRITS format. Right here seems like an opportunity for some Github integration, adding continuous integration and deployment to open source intelligence and processing workflows. Making sure refined, relevant threat information is available where it is needed, via existing API deployment and integration workflows. Wouldn’t take much to publish CSV, YAML, and JSON files to Github which can then be used to drive distributed dashboards, visualizations, and other awareness building tools. Plus, the refined threat information is now published as CSV/JSON/YAML on Github where it can be ingested by any system of application with access to the Github repository.</p>

<p>GOSINT is just one of the interesting tooling I’m coming across as I turn up the volume on <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com">my API security research</a>, thanks to <a href="https://www.elasticbeam.com/">the investment of ElasticBeam my API security partner</a>. They’ve invested in an API security guide, as well as white paper, which is something that will generate a wealth of stories like this along the way, as I find interesting API security artifacts. I’m looking to map out the API security landscape, but I’m also interested in understanding open source API aggregation, analysis, and syndication platforms that integrate with existing CI/CD workflows, to help feed <a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">my existing human services API work</a>, and other city, state, and federal government API projects I’m working on.</p>

<p>I’m always on the hunt for healthy patterns that I would like to see API providers, and API service providers consider when crafting their own strategies. It’s what I do as the API Evangelist. Find common patterns. Understand the good ones, and the bad ones. Tell stories about both, helping folks understand the possibilities, and what they should be thinking about as they plan their operations.</p>

<p>One very useful API that notifies you about security vulnerabilities, license violations and out-dated dependencies in your Git repositories, <a href="https://www.versioneye.com/api/">has a nice approach to delivering their API</a>, as well as <a href="https://github.com/versioneye">the other components of their stack</a>. You can either use VersionEye in the cloud, or you can deploy on-premise:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/versioneye/versioneye-core">versioneye-core</a> - Models, Services &amp; Mails for VersionEye</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/versioneye/crawl_r">crawl_r</a> - VersionEye crawlers implemented in Ruby.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/versioneye/versioneye-security">versioneye-security</a> - Security Crawler for VersionEye</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/versioneye/versioneye-api">versioneye-api</a> - JSON REST API for VersionEye</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/versioneye/versioneye-tasks">versioneye-tasks</a> - Thin wrapper around the versioneye-core.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/versioneye/versioneye">versioneye</a> - VersionEye.com</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/versioneye/">VersionEye also has their entire stack available as Docker images</a>, ready for deployment anywhere you need them. I wanted have a single post that I can reference when talking about possible open source, on-premise, continuous integration approaches to delivering API solutions, that actually have a sensible business model. VersionEye spans the areas that I think API providers should consider investing in, delivering SaaS or on-premise, while also delivering open source solutions, and generating sensible amounts of revenue.</p>

<p>Many APIs I come across do not have an open source version of their API. They may have open source SDKs, and other tooling on Github, but rarely does an API provider offer up an open source copy of their API, as well as Docker images. VersionEye’s approach to operating in the cloud, and on-premise, while leveraging open source and APIs, as well as dovetailing with existing continuous integration flows is worth bookmarking. I am feeling like this is the future of API deployment and consumption, but don’t get nervous, there is still plenty of money to be be made via the cloud services.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/twitter/twitter-websites-embeddable.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>Over the years I have regularly showcased Twitter as an example API driven embeddable tools like buttons, badges, and widgets. In 2017, after spending some time in the Twitter developer portal, it is good to see <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/products/web">Twitter still investing in their embeddable tools</a>. The landing page for the Twitter embeddables still provides the best example out there of the value of using APIs to drive data and content across a large number of remote web sites.</p>

<p>Twitter has distinct elements of their web embeddables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tweet Button - That classic tweet button, allowing users to quickly Tweet from any website.</li>
  <li>Embedded Tweets - Taking any Tweet and embedding on a web page showing its full content.</li>
  <li>Embedded Timeline - Showing curated timelines on any website using a Twitter embeddable widget.</li>
  <li>Follow Button - Helping users quickly follow your Twitter account, or your companies Twitter account.</li>
  <li>Twitter Cards - Present link summaries, engaging images, product information, or inline video as embeddable cards in timeline.</li>
</ul>

<p>Account interactions, messaging, posting, and other API enabled function made portable using JavaScript allowing it to be embedded and executed on any website. JavaScript widgets, buttons, and other embeddables are still a very tangible, useful example of APIs in action. Something I can talk about to anyone about, helping them understand why you might want to do APIs, or at least know about APIs.</p>

<p>We bash on Twitter a lot in the API community. However, after a decade of operation, you have to give it to them. They are still doing it. They are still keeping it simple with embeddable tools like this. I can confidently say that APIs are automating some serious illness on the Twitter API platform at the moment, and there are many things I’d like to be different with the Twitter API, but I am still pleased that I can keep finding examples from the Twitter platform to showcase on API Evangelist seven years of writing about them.</p>

<p>I found a couple more API patents in my notebook that I wanted to get published. I try to take time regularly to publish the strangest API related patents I can find. Today’s patent is out of Amazon, which I find to be a fascinating outlet for patent storytelling. It isn’t squarely in the realm of APIs like some of my others, but I think tells a fascinating story by itself, showing how the web and the concept of a patent are colliding.</p>

<p>Title - <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/9397835">Web of trust management in a distributed system</a><br />
Number - 9397835<br />
Owner - Amazon Technologies, Inc.<br />
Publication Date - 2016-07-19<br />
Application Date - 2014-05-21<br /></p>

<p>Abstract - A web of trust is used to validate states of a distributed system. The distributed system operates based at least in part on a domain trust. A root of trust issues the domain trust issues a domain trust. Domain trusts are updatable in accordance with rules of previous domain trusts so that a version of a domain trust is verifiable by verifying a chain of previous domain trust versions._</p>

<p>I like that trust is being patented. Digital trust as a patentable concept that Amazon can now delegate if they choose. I’m just fascinated by what concepts are now fair game for patenting, as they enter into the digital realm. Now I’m curious how many physical trust patents might exist. Is the management of trust patented in the physical world in any way? I guess I could see some of the components for determining trust could be patented, but I find the fact that trust, or more specifically trust management is patentable, as a troubling thing.</p>

<p>It’s no secret that I’m anti API patents. I’m rarely convinced of the uniqueness of anything digital, warranting the issuing of a patent by the USPTO. I have to say that in a world where trust is patentable, the environment for suspect behavior will flourish. Pretty much what we are seeing play out on the web on a daily basis. I’m adding this patent to my <a href="http://authentication.apievangelist.com/">API authentication</a> and <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">API security</a> research, because it is a component that exists already in these areas, and should be readily available for any provider to execute as they see fit.</p>

<p>I am spending a significant amount of time reading RFCs lately. I find the documents to be very cumbersome to read, but the more you read, the more tolerant you become. When I browse through RFCs I’m always reminded of how little I actually know about the web. In an effort to push forward my education, and maybe yours along the way, I’m going to be cherry picking specific sections of the interesting RFCs I’m digesting here on the blog. <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3205">Today’s RFC is 3205, filed under Best Current Practice”, and is on the use of HTTP as a Substrate</a>.</p>

<p>_Recently there has been widespread interest in using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [1] as a substrate for other applications- level protocols. Various reasons cited for this interest have included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>familiarity and mindshare,</li>
  <li>compatibility with widely deployed browsers,</li>
  <li>ability to reuse existing servers and client libraries,</li>
  <li>ease of prototyping servers using CGI scripts and similar extension mechanisms, authentication  and SSL or TLS,</li>
  <li>the ability of HTTP to traverse firewalls, and</li>
  <li>cases where a server often needs to support HTTP anyway.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Internet community has a long tradition of protocol reuse, dating back to the use of Telnet as a substrate for FTP and SMTP.  However, the recent interest in layering new protocols over HTTP has raised a number of questions when such use is appropriate, and the proper way to use HTTP in contexts where it is appropriate. Specifically, for a given application that is layered on top of HTTP:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Should the application use a different port than the HTTP default  of 80?</li>
  <li>Should the application use traditional HTTP methods (GET, POST,  etc.) or should it define new methods?</li>
  <li>Should the application use http: URLs or define its own prefix?</li>
  <li>Should the application define its own MIME-types, or use something  that already exists (like registering a new type of MIME-directory structure)?</li>
</ul>

<p>This memo recommends certain design decisions in answer to these  questions.</p>

<p>This memo is intended as advice and recommendation for protocol designers, working groups, implementors, and IESG, rather than as a strict set of rules which must be adhered to in all cases. Accordingly, the capitalized key words defined in RFC 2119, which are intended to indicate conformance to a specification, are not used in this memo._</p>

<p>I love the notion of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3205">HTTP as a substrate</a>. The definition of substrate is “a substance or layer that underlies something, or on which some process occurs, in particular” or also, “the surface or material on or from which an organism lives, grows, or obtains its nourishment”. I also love the notion of providing guidance for this line of thought. There are many things contained in this document I have learned from my time in the space, and included in my storytelling, without much thought regarding where it originated, or how accurate it was. I particularly like the notion of HTTP as a material in which an organism lives, but maybe more of a digital organism, or a bot. A reminder that everything that may take seed, flourish and grow in this environment, might not always be a good thing.</p>

<p>I don’t have any production experience deploying <a href="https://jwt.io/introduction/">JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</a>, but it has been something I’ve been reading up on, and staying in tune with for some time. I often reference JWT as the leading edge for API authentication, but there is one aspect of JWT I think is worth me referencing more often–message integrity. JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.</p>

<p>JWT can not only be used for authentication of both message sender/receiver, it can ensure the message integrity as well, leveraging a digital signature hash value of the message body to ensure the message integrity during transmission. It adds another interesting dimension to the <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com">API security</a> conversation, and while not be applicable in all APIs, I know many that it would make a lot of sense. Many of the networks we use today and applications we depend on today are proxied, creating an environment where message integrity should always come into question, and JWT gives us another tool in our toolbox to help us keep things secure.</p>

<p>I’m working my way through each layer of API operations, looking for aspects of API security that are often obscured, hidden, or just not discussed as they should be. I feel like JWT is definitely one track of API security that has evolved the conversation significantly over the last couple years, and is something that can make a significant impact on the space with just a little more storytelling and education. I’m going to make sure API request and response message integrity is a regular part of my API security storytelling, curriculum, and live talks that I develop.</p>

<p>A topic that keeps coming up in discussions with my partner in crime Audrey Watters (@audreywatters) about our podcast is around the future of labor in an API world. I have not written anything about this, which means I’m still in early stages of any research into this area, but it has come up in conversation, and reflected regularly in my monitoring of the API space, I need to begin working through my ideas in this area. A process that helps me better see what is coming down the API pipes, and fill the gaps in what I do not know.</p>

<p>Audrey has long joked about my API world using a simple phrase: “reducing everything to a transaction”. She says it mostly in jest, but other times I feel like she wields it as the Cassandra she channels. I actually bring up the phrase more than she does, because it is something I regularly find myself working in the service of as the API Evangelist. By taking a pro API stance I am actively working to reduce legacy business, institutional, and government processes down and breaking them down into a variety of individual tasks, or if you see things through a commercial lens, transactions.</p>

<p><strong>Microservices</strong><br />
A microservices philosophy is all about breaking down monoliths into small bite size chunks, so they can be transacted independently, scaled, evolved, and deprecated in isolation. Microservices should do one thing, and do it well (no backtalk). Microservices should do what it does as efficiently as possible, with as few dependencies as possible. Microservices are self-contained, self-sufficient, and have everything they need to get the job done under a single definition of a service (a real John Wayne of compute). And of course, everything has an API. Microservices aren’t just about decoupling the technology, they are are about decoupling the business, and the politics of doing business within SMB, SME, enterprises, institutions, and government agencies–the philosophy for reducing everything to a transaction.</p>

<p><strong>Containers</strong><br />
A microservice way of thinking about software that is born in the clouds, a bi-product of virtualization and API-ization of IT resources like storage and compute. In the last decade, as IT services moved from the basement of companies into the cloud, a new approach to delivering the compute, storage, and scalability needed to drive this new microservices way of doing business emerged that was called containers. In 2017 businesses are being containerized. The enterprise monolith is being reduced down to small transactions, putting the technology, business, and politics of each business transaction into a single container, for more efficient development, deployment, scaling, and management. Containers are the vehicle moving the microservices philosophy forward–the virtualized embodiment of reducing everything to a transaction.</p>

<p><strong>Serverless</strong><br />
Alongside a microservice way of life, driven by containerization, is another technological trend (undertow) called serverless. With the entire IT backend being virtualized in the cloud, the notion of the server is disappearing, lightening the load for developers in their quest for containerizing everything, turning the business landscape into microservices, than can be distilled down to a single, simple, executable, scalable function. Serverless is the codified conveyor belt of transactions rolling by each worker on the factory floor. Each slot on a containerized, serverless, microservices factory floor possessing a single script or function, allowing each transaction to be executed,  and replicated allowing it to be applied over and over, scaled, and fixed as needed. Serverless is the big metal stamping station along a multidimensional digital factory assembly line.</p>

<p><strong>DevOps</strong><br />
Living in microservices land, with everything neatly in containers, being assembled, developed, and wrenched on by developers, you are increasingly given more (or less) control over the conveyor belt that rolls by you on the factory floor. As a transaction developer you are given the ability to change direction of your conveyor belt, speed things up, apply one or many metal stamp templates, and orchestrate as much, or as little of the transaction supply chain as you can keep up with (meritocracy 5.3.4). Some transaction developers will be closer to the title of architect, understanding larger portions of the transaction supply chain, while most will be specialized, applying one or a handful of transaction templates, with no training or awareness of the bigger picture, simply pulling the Devops knobs and levers within their reach.</p>

<p><strong>Blockchain</strong><br />
Another trend (undertow) that has been building for sometime, that I have managed to ignore as much as I can (until recently) is the blockchain. Blockchain and the emergence of API driven smart contracts has brought the technology front and center for me, making it something i can ignore, as I see signs that each API transaction will soon be put in the blockchain. The blockchain appears to becoming the decentralized (ha!) and encrypted manifestation of what many of us has been calling the API contract for years. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-enterprise-smart-contracts/">I am seeing movements from all the major cloud providers</a>, and lesser known API providers to <a href="https://medium.com/@kevinsimper/serverless-is-the-jump-before-ethereum-smart-contracts-121d92e67426">ensure that all transactions are put into the blockchain</a>, providing a record of everything that flows through API pipes, and has been decoupled, containerized, rendered as serverless, and available for devops orchestration.</p>

<p><strong>Ignorance of Labor</strong><br />
I am not an expert in labor, unions, and markets. Hell, I still haven’t even finished my Marx and Engels Reader. But, I know enough to be able to see that us developers are fucking ourselves right now. Our quest to reduce everything to a transaction, decouple all the things, and containerize and render them serverless makes us the perfect tool(s) for some pretty dark working conditions. Sure, some of us will have the bigger picture, and make a decent living being architects. The rest of us will become digital assembly line workers, stamping, maintaining a handful of services that do one thing and do it well. We will be completely unaware of dependencies, or how things are orchestrated, barely able to stay afloat, pay the bills, leaving us thankful for any transactions sent our way.</p>

<p>Think of this frontline in terms of Amazon Mechanical Turk + API + Microservices + Containers + Serverless + Blockhain. There is a reason young developers make for good soldiers on this front line. Lack of awareness of history. Lack of awareness of labor. Makes great digital factory floor workers, stamping transactions for reuse elsewhere in the digital assembly line process. This model will fit well with current Silicon Valley culture. There will still be enough opportunity in this environment for architects and cybersecurity theater conductors to make money, exploit, and generate wealth. Without the defense of unions, government or institutions, us developers will find ourselves reduced to transactions, stamping out other transactions on the digital assembly line floor.</p>

<p>I know you think your savvy. I used to think this too. Then after having the rug pulled out from under me, and the game changed around me by business partners, investors, and other actors who were playing a game I’m not familiar with, I have become more critical. You can look around the landscape right now and see numerous ways in which power has set its sights on the web, and completely distorting any notion of the web being democratic, open, inclusive, or safe environment. Why do us developers think it will be any different wit us? Oh yeah, privilege.</p>

<p>I have my own URL shortener for API Evangelist called apis.how. I use it to track the click through rates for some of my research projects, and partner sponsorships. I’ve had the URL shortener in operation for about two years now, and I still do not have any type of UI for it, relying 100% on Postman for adding, searching, and managing the URLs I am shortening, and tracking on.</p>

<p>My URL shortener just hasn’t raised to a level of priority where I’ll invest any time into an administrative interface, or dashboard for my URL shortener. I used Bitly and Google for a while, but I really just needed a simple shortening with basic counts, nothing more. When I bought the domain I launched a handful of API endpoints to support, allowing me to add, update, search, and remove URLs, as well as track the click throughs, and query how many clicks a link received for each mont. I can easily accomplish all of this through the Postman interface, making basic calls to my simple API–no over-engineering necessary.</p>

<p>I have been considering running a daily job that pulls view counts for URLs and publishing to Github as YAML, where I can drive a simple visualization, but honestly I’m not that numbers oriented. I like what API clients like <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> and <a href="https://restlet.com/">Restlet</a> provide. Even though I’m equipped to make calls using JavaScript, PHP, or CURL, I prefer just accessing via my web client–no coding necessary. I wouldn’t manage all my systems in this way, but for really basic ones like my URL shortener, I’m not sure I will ever actually evolve it beyond just being a simple API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/power-lines-empty-space_copper_circuit.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’m rarely surprised by, but still often caught off guard by the subtle ways in which power asserts itself when faced with change the introduced by API projects. In my 30 years as a database professional I’ve seen numerous overt, covert, and subversive ways in which existing holders of power (data), but I often still get blindsided by the creative, and subtle ways in which folks defend what they already have, and work to keep things from changing.</p>

<p>While doing unfunded work to define industry level API specifications, and help move forward the API conversation in multiple industries, I’ve been encountering two pockets of friction I want to understand better, so I can develop some sort of grease, that might make things smoother. There are two main pockets of practitioners in this setting, implementors (those you publish an API), and vendors (those who currently sell solutions to implementors). My role in any industry as the API Evangelist is to help ultimately define and showcase healthy, common API definitions, that can be reused across the API lifecycle–from design to deprecation.</p>

<p><strong>The Vendor Question</strong>
Trying to understand the culture, and motivations of any SMB, SME, or enterprise is often a full time job I do not have the time or resources for. I work pretty hard to understand any of the key players in any industry being touched by APIs, but will still have much I need to learn. One thing I do know, is that I should never take a company for face value, because behind the mask there is always much more going on. Honestly, APIs are actually a pretty good barometer of what is going on behind the scenes, something I don’t think some API providers fully grasp before they decide to jump into the API game.</p>

<p>The most obvious thing a vendor in an industry will do is ignore you. When approached about participating in discussions around a common API definition, they’ll just not return your emails, tweets, and other front door solicitations–this is fine, many are busy, or just very confident in their place within an industry. Next, you’ll get the folks who will join you at the table in some capacity, or other. Most are busy, and will have limited time–that is understood. What I am trying to understand is their behavior once they are at the table, because I feel that many of them aren’t actually at the table to participate. They are at the table to be present, influence the discussion, which often times might mean keeping the discussion from moving forward at all.</p>

<p>As someone who does not have a job, and regular paycheck, I’m fascinated by the amount of time that can be wasted by SMB, SME, and enterprise folks when you are trying to talk about a common API definition. I don’t care if you have a machine readable way to define the conversation using OpenAPI for the API, and JSON schema for the schema, folks will find a way to dance around any clear process and framework. The first hurdle is always learning to speak OpenAPI and JSON schema, and helping vendors become fluent in OpenAPI, allowing conversations be anchored to specific APIs, paths, headers, parameters, responses, and schema. This is no guarantee of forward motion, but it does help keep things focused, and potentially productive around establishment of a common API contract.</p>

<p>With vendors, all roads lead to their products, and their solutions. The question is always how we can best get them to invest in shared public API infrastructure, over routing all conversations to their platform, on their roads. Money and investment is always the quickest way I see vendors take control of conversations, and route things in their direction. Let’s work on this project, or this infrastructure involving a specific implementation of our choosing, and we’ll move forward the API standards conversation in those terms, and within the context of our choosing and funding. Sure, some environments might actually be conducive to moving things forward, but I think we need to think deeply about how we decouple the technology, business, and politics of all vendor project engagements.</p>

<p>All vendors are suspect. Even the nice ones. Honestly, those are the ones that worry me the most. I’ve had way more time of mine wasted by nice vendors, talking about participating, putting meetings in the calendar, and collaborating on press releases that never see the light of day, to know better. Honestly, the opinionated, straight forward vendors are the ones I worry about least–you know where they stand. From my view all vendor projects need to have a defined (de)coupling from specific vendor interests and the standards interest. Keeping this API is the best way do this, as the central API specification will have an OpenAPI and JSON schema, as will the individual project. Using OpenAPI as a contract for vendor engagement provides a nice scaffolding for this (de)coupling, keeping any billable hours spent measured by commits to the OpenAPI, JSON Schema, or actually now that I’m thinking about it an APIs.json or other discovery document.</p>

<p>Now I am getting to the goal of writing this post. Each vendor related project will begin and end as a Github repository with an OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and APIs.json as the central definition, and contract. This will be the central (de)coupling business contract, even if the vendor, and other parties are not fluent in OpenAPI, JSON Schema, or APIs.json. I will maintain the contract, and communicate it out in all proposals, meetings, and project documentation, encouraging awareness and literacy around all three specifications when possible. With API definitions published to Github as central contract, it regularly allows me to assess progress made, and measure the effectiveness of individual projects, making decision on how to fund and move forward, as well as cut them loose when they are no longer making sense.</p>

<p><strong>The Implementors Dilemma</strong>
Individual API implementations are an entirely different beast from vendors, and while they may live within the tractor beam of one or many vendors, they often have their own silos, resource deficient, and organizational isolation that drives it’s quest to retain power. In each of these industries I am approaching things from a position of harmonization, standardization, interoperability, and reuse, which is often out of view of individual implementors. Individual industry level API implementations want to be successful in their context, and often want the benefits of harmonization, standardization, interoperability, and reuse that are being suggested, but rarely want to, or have the time to do the had work needed to make necessary changes. This will manifest itself in many different ways when you are trying to talk about API standards, something that is often in response to, or driven by the power motivations of vendors who have their ear.</p>

<p>Literacy and awareness are the biggest challenges with individual implementors. Whether federal government, city government, higher educational institutions, or small regional nonprofit organizations, almost every group I come across is underfunded, and under-resourced when it comes to their IT needs, and the delivery of data and content systems. Many folks I meet are well meaning, but lack the skills and training necessary to deliver scalable IT systems, having often landed in their jobs by accident, and being in the right place at the right time. Some are aware of these deficiencies, but lack time and resources they need to get the training they need, while others are completely unaware, and in denial, often taking a very hostile and combative approach when it comes to new ideas, even if they may seem like common practice in the wider API sector.</p>

<p>The majority of organizations I come across are not ready for API. They are not confident in what they know, and what they do not know. They want to share data and information, but often aren’t setup technically or culturally to share data and information. Implementors want to be able to leverage data from other implementations, and reuse open source code, services, and tooling, but will rarely want to do the hard work required to reciprocate in these environments. While well meaning, many are so far behind because of many decisions they’ve made along the way to stay behind, and will require a significant amount of training and investment to bring into alignment with industry-wide standards. Some will never be brought into alignment, and should be replaced–whether they are well meaning or not.</p>

<p>Similar to all vendors, each individual API implementation should have it’s own contract and repository. If an OpenAPI cannot be mocked for an implementation, bringing into focus existing schema, and access requirements for an individual API implementation, it is unlikely that an implementation will ever be moved forward. OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and APIs.json help quantify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>API Operations - What APIs are there, as well as all supporting resources like documentation, registration, terms of service, and other things that govern doing business online today.</li>
  <li>API Access - What are the technical details for each API path, parameter, and schema, providing a detailed list of what each access request and response involves.</li>
  <li>Data &amp; Content - What data and content is being made available, often reflecting backend databases and other systems, but ideally reflects common schema that can be reused in other systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>If an organization can not come together have a constructive conversation around access to data, content as part of a new approach to working with external groups via an API operations, it is unlikely and individual implementation will ever be viable. OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and APIs.json can all exist as YAML documents, which is (should be) plain language, no code, brackets or otherwise, allowing business and technical groups to both participate. Similar to vendor implementations, I will be providing oversight of each Github repository, and central project OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and APIs.json index, but ideally each individual implementation becomes the keeper of the contract for each of their projects, requiring only minimal engagement from other implementations, vendors, or at the standards level of the discussion.</p>

<p><strong>Bringing This Home For Next Round Of Conversations</strong>
Ok, I actually have to invest in the next rounds of these industry level API discussions. I think I’ve settled in on my Github repo managed, OpenAPI, and APIs.json governance of these large number of relationships I need to engage in, manage, and measure. I’ve been blindsided by several conversations at the implementation, vendor, and industry levels, across city and federal government levels, and small, medium, and larger corporations lately. My goal in this post is to help me mitigate damage in future conversations, and keep myself moving along at a faster pace, with least amount of friction on my end as I can. When dealing with so many personalities, as I am across a handful of industries, it is something can be very exhausting if I do not find a way to insulate myself.</p>

<p>Each vendor and implementation involved with the defining of an industry API standard with live as a Github repository. Being able to sign up for a Github account, and participate in issues is a minimum entry fee. Not that they’ll be excluded. They’ll just be identified as making a choice to stay behind. The presence and robustness of an APIs.json will be the next layer of definition, providing essential links to API operations for either the vendor or the implementation. In my opinion, this is always a great way to size up a company, organization, institutions, and government agency. Similar to how you can size up an organization by their web, and social media presence, if they don’t have an existing API or open data effort already, there are other deficiencies right around the corner, or behind the firewall.</p>

<p>Next, the presence and evolution of a coherent OpenAPI and JSON Schema will bring into focus the viability of a vendor partnership, and individual implementation viability. If an OpenAPI can be established and moved forward, there is potential. If there hasn’t been commits in months, and difference between commits productive, with a healthy amount of issue activity, I’m guessing a vendor relationship, or individual API implementation needs further assessment regarding its viability, and sustainability. Of course, any final decisions are made by a human (me), as everything I’m discussing here operates under the API Evangelist, and Adopta.Agency network of API research projects.</p>

<p>The majority of my time as API Evangelist is spent researching the technology, business, and politics of API operations across ALL industries. I’ve created my Adopta.Agency domain to help me manage my investment in common API definitions, schema, and actual implementations of public open data and API projects. I’m trying to establish an approach to help define common OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and APIs.json for a number of industries, that allows me to move forward a number of conversations, with the least amount of friction, and impact on me. I don’t enjoy getting sucked into politics, and prefer staying at the highest level possible when it comes to helping influence what is API today–something that is impacting a significant portion of our world, not just the tech sector.</p>

<p>I’ve been tracking on many different API industries using small data driven Github repositories for three years now. <a href="http://theapistack.com">I track on over 1500 APIs using my API Stack research</a>, which has morphed into what I call the Stack.Network, where I profile specific industries or sectors of how we do business online today–companies like <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://microsoft.stack.network/">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="http://google.stack.network/">Google</a>. My API Stack research is all about identifying common patterns across individual API implementations, aggregating them into over 1500 individual building blocks that contribute to my definition of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/api-lifecycle/">the almost 100 stops along a modern API lifecycle</a>. Each of my stacks tends to represent an industry like SMS, or news, but I also have individual company stacks like <a href="http://facebook.stack.network/">Facebook</a>, or possibly even <a href="http://gsa.index.apievangelist.com/">the federal government like with the General Services Administration (GSA)</a>. Each of these projects have an OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and APIs.json core, which gives me a distilled down definition of each stack for inclusion across my research.</p>

<p>I’m looking to define I want to expand my existing approach to quantifying the world of APIs to include specific APIs, schema, implementations, and collections, and open it up for collaboration and discussion with a variety of vendors who may serve multiple industries, as well as specific implementations within an industry. Honestly, nothing really changes for me in all of this, except that I will be encouraging vendors and implementations to at least participate, and ideally move forward their own OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. I’m also looking to encourage them to be a little more Github fluent when it comes to defining a common industry API definition and schema. I see Github as just another social network like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest, except the actions taken often revolve around code, and machine readable templates, instead of messages, images, video, and other common social building blocks.</p>

<p>Ok, phew. If you are still reading this, you should probably develop a hobby. I’m writing this to help me get my ducks in order. If it makes sense to you, and helps you in your API journey–awesome! I feel I have to regularly write about the feels I get in my working as the API Evangelist. It is about me talking through what I’m seeing, and finding a way forward. The scope at which some of these API conversations are occurring at can be dizzying, and if I don’t step back from time to time, and just work through my feels, they tend to pile up and I stumble more. This post help me come around full circle to realize some of the new projects I’ve been taking on are actually just an extension of what I’ve already been doing as I map the world of APIs, I’m just turning up the intimacy level on some of the vendor and implementation level relationships. However I’ve done a pretty good job of building an insulator between me an the space, I just need to keep doing what I’ve been doing for the last seven years, and confidently push some more of these common API definitions, schema, and collections out the door.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://thebioscope.net/2010/11/23/tied-to-the-tracks/"><img src="https://bioscopic.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/barneyoldfield.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://gcn.com/Articles/2017/07/06/NYPD-Palantir-crime-analysis.aspx">I was reading about the difficulties the City of New York was having when it comes to migrating off of the Palantir platform</a>, while also reading about the latest cybersecurity drama involving ransomware. I’m spending a lot of time studying cybersecurity lately, partly because they involve APIs, but mostly because it is something that is impacting every aspect of our lives, including our democracy, education, and healthcare. One thing I notice on the cybersecurity stage, is that everything is a much more extreme, intense, representation of what is going on in the mainstream tech industry.</p>

<p>Ransomware is software that gets installed on your desktop or servers and locks up all your data until you pay the software developer (implementor) a ransom. Ransomware is just a much faster moving version of what many of us in the software industry call vendor lock-in. This is what you are seeing with Palantir, and the City of New York. What tech companies do is get you to install their software on your desktop or servers, or convince you to upload all your data into the cloud, and use their software. This is business 101 in the tech industry. You either develop cloud-based software, something that runs on-premise, or you are a mix of both. Ideally, your customers become dependent on you, and they keep paying your monthly, quarterly, or annual subscriptions (cough cough ransom).</p>

<p>Here is where the crafty API part of the scheme comes in. Software providers can also make APIs that allow your desktop and server to integrate with their cloud solutions, allowing for much deeper integration of data, content, and algorithms. The presence of APIs SHOULD also mean that you can more easily get your data, content, and algorithms back, or have kept in sync the whole time, so that when you are ready to move on, you don’t have a problem getting your data and content back. The problem is, that APIs “CAN” enable this, but in many situations providers do not actually give you complete access to your data, content, or algorithms via API, and enable the true data portability and sync features you need to continue doing business without them.</p>

<p>This is vendor lock-in. It is a much friendlier, slower moving version of ransomware. As a software vendor you want your software to be baked in to a customers operations so they are dependent on you. How aggressively you pursue this, and how much you limit data portability, and interoperability, dictates whether you are just doing business as usual, or engaging in vendor lock-in. One thing I’m hopeful for in all of this, are the vendors who see transparency, observability, interoperability, and portability of not just the technical, but also the business and politics of delivering technology as a legitimate competitive advantage. This means that they will always be able to out maneuver, and stay ahead of software vendors who practice vendor lock-in and ransomware, whether of the slow or fast moving variety.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-services.png" align="right" width="30%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I am trying to help push forward the conversation around <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">the API definition for the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a> in a constructive way amidst a number of competing interests. I was handed a schema for sharing data about about organizations, locations, and services in a CSV format. I took this schema and exposed it with a set of API paths, keeping the flat file structure in tact, making no assumptions around how someone would need to access the data. I simply added the ability to get HSDS over the web as JSON–I would like to extend to be HTML, CSV, JSON, and XML, reaching as wide as possible audience with the basic implementation.</p>

<p>As we move forward discussions around HSDS and HSDA I’m looking to use media types to help separate the different types of access people are looking for using media types. I don’t want to leave folks who only have basic CSV export or import capabilities behind, but still wanted to provide guidance for exchanging HSDA over the web. To help organize higher levels of demand on the HSDS schema I’m going to break out into some specialized media types as well as the default set:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</strong> - text/csv - Keeping data package basic, spreadsheet friendly, yet portable and exchangeable.</li>
  <li><strong>Human Services Data API (HSDA)</strong> - application/json and text/xml, text/csv, and text/html - Governing access at the most basic level, keeping true to schema, but allowing for content negotiation over the web.</li>
  <li><strong>Human Services Data API (HSDA) Hypermedia</strong> - (application/hal+json and application/hal+xml)  - Allowing for more comprehensive responses to HSDA requests, addressing searching, filtering, pagination, and relationship linking between any HSDS returend.</li>
  <li><strong>Human Services Data API (HSDA) Bulk</strong> - (application/vnd.hsda.bulk) - Focusing on heavy system to system bulk transfers, and eventually syncing, backups, archives, and migrations. Dealing with the industrial levels of HSDA operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Human Services Data API (HSDA) Federated</strong> - (application/vnd.hsda.federated) - Allowing for a federated HSDA implementation that allows for the moderation of all POST, PUT, and DELETE by a distributed set of partners. Might also accompany the bulk system where partners can enable sync or bulk extraction for use in their own implementations.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am working to define an industry level API standard. I am not operating an individual API implementation (well I do have several demos), so media types allows me to enable each vendor, or implementation to negotiate the type of content they desire. If they are interested developing single page applications or conversational interfaces they can offer up the hypermedia implementation. If they are system administrators and looking to load up large datasets, or extract large datasets, they can work within the HSDA Bulk realm. In the end I can see any one of these APIs being deployed in isolation, as well as all four of them living side by side, driving a single HSDS/A compliant platform.</p>

<p>This is all preliminary thought. All I have currently is HSDS, and HSDA returning JSON. I’m just brainstorming about what possible paths there are forward, and what I think the solution involves content negotiation, at the vendor, implementation, and consumption levels. Content type negotiation seems to provide a great way to break up and separate concerns, keeping simple things simple, and some of the more robust integrations segregated, while still working in concert. I’m always impressed by the meaningful impact something like content type has had on the web API design conversation, and always surprised when I learn new approaches to leveraging the content type header as part of API operations.</p>

<p><a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/bkyan/StyleThief">I was playing around with the Style Thief, an image transfer API from Algorithmia</a>, and I noticed the citation for the algorithm behind. The API is an adaptation of <a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style/">Anish Athalye’s Neural Style Transfer</a>, and I thought the algorithmic citation of where the work was derived from was an interesting thing to take note of for my machine learning API research.</p>

<p>I noticed on Algorithmia’s page there was <a href="http://www.bibtex.org/">a Bibtex citation</a>, which referenced the author, and project Github repository:</p>

<p>@misc{athalye2015neuralstyle,<br />

I guess rather then technical dependency, it is more in the business and legal dependency category.</p>

<p>Similar to how Pivio allows you to reference dependencies for your microservices, I’m thinking that <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, or some other format like Bibtext could provide a machine readable citation, that could be indexed as part of an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json index</a>. Allowing us API designers, architect, and providers to provide proper citation for where our work is derived. These aren’t just technical dependencies, but also business and political dependencies, that we should ensuring are present with each API we deploy, providing an observable provenance of where ideas come from, and a honest look at how we build on the work of each other.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/art-museum/art-museum_copper_circuit_2.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’m neck deep into my assessment of the world of API security this week, a process which always yields plenty of random thoughts, which end up becoming stories here on the blog. One aspect of API security I keep coming across in this research is the concept of API rate limiting as being security. This is something I’ve long attributed with API management service providers making their mark on the API landscape, but as I dig deeper I think there is more to this notion of what API security is (or isn’t). I think it has more to do with API providers, than companies selling their warez to these API providers.</p>

<p>The API management service providers have definitely set the tone for API security conversation(good), by standing up a gateway, and providing tools for limiting what access is available–I think many data, content, and algorithmic stewards are very narrowly focus on security being ONLY about limiting access to their valuable resources. Many folks I come across see their resources as valuable, when they begin doing APIs they have a significant amount of concern around putting their resources on the Internet, and once you secure and begin rate limiting things, all security concerns appear to have been dealt with. Competitors, and others just can’t get at your valuable resources, they have to come through the gate–API security done.</p>

<p>Many API providers I encounter have unrealistic views of the value of their data, content, and algorithms, and when you match this with their unrealistic views about how much others want access to this valuable content you end up with a vacuum which allows for some very narrow views of what API security is. To help support this type of thinking, I feel like the awareness generated from API management is often focused on generating revenue, and not always about understanding API abuse, and is also something can create blindspots when it comes to database, server, and DNS level logging and layers where security threats emerge. I’m assuming folks often feel comfortable that the API management layer is sufficiently securing things by rate limiting, and we can see all traffic through the analytics dashboard. I’m feeling that this one of the reasons folks aren’t looking up at the bigger API security picture.</p>

<p>From what I’m seeing, assumptions that the API management layer is securing things can leave blind spots in other areas like DNS, threat information gathering, aggregation, collaboration, and sharing. I’ve come across API providers who are focused in on API management, but don’t have visibility at the database, server, container, and web server logging levels, and are only paying attention to what their API management dashboard provides access to. I feel like API management opened up a new found awareness for API provides, something that has evolved and spread to <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">API monitoring</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">API testing</a>, and <a href="http://performance.apievangelist.com/">API performance</a>. I feel like the next wave of awareness will be in the area of API security. I’m just trying to explore ways that I can help my readers and clients better understand how to expand their vision of API security beyond their current field of vision.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/03/microservice-discovery-using-pivio/">I was learning about Pivio, a discovery specification for microservices the other day, and found their focus on microservice dependency to be pretty interesting</a>. API dependencies has been an area I have found myself increasingly thinking about, as well as tracking on in my API research. I’m pretty close to publishing a project dedicated to understanding API, and microservices dependencies, which would overlap with containers, serverless, and other aspects of the API lifecycle that are all about breaking down the monolith.</p>

<p>Each service definition using Pivio has a depends_on object, which allows for defining both internal and external service dependencies. Here is a snippet from a sample Pivio document to help articulate this interesting feature:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/728a92155bc507a526182b3b767a73d1.js"></script>

<p>This is where you can start connecting the cords between all of your services, something that is applicable to any APIs, whether you’ve drank the microservices kool-aid or not. I find it interesting that Pivio has internal, and external. I’d love to see an OpenAPI linked off each of the services it depends on. I also am fascinated with the first question for external, why? What a great first question for any dependency–it should also be available for internal services as well. Every API provider should be inquiring why a dependency exist whenever possible, and having it quantified in this way just opens up more chances for this question to get asked.</p>

<p>Seeing dependencies quantified in Pivio makes me happy. It has been something I’ve wanted to reflect in <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> for some time now. Currently, I do not know of any way to quantify the relationship between APIs, and Pivio provides a glimpse at one possible way we might be able to map this world out. <a href="http://www.cytoscape.org/">I have been learning more about Cytoscape, a network data integration, analysis, and visualization framework</a>. Having a machine readable API dependencies definition would allow me to create a network visualization of any API or microservices discovery catalog. It wouldn’t take much work at all to map out API and microservice dependencies at the internal and external levels, further helping to quantify the platforms we operate.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/mining-machine-learning.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I spend a lot of time trying out new APIs, working to understand what it is they do, or do not do. I have a pretty robust way of looking at APIs, profiling the company, and the APIs they offer, but when I’m wading through the marketing content, API documentation, and other resources, I am regularly stumped by the language that is used to describe what an API does. Honestly, this problem isn’t exclusive to machine learning APIs, but with the recent explosion in artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, cognitive and other types of algorithmic voodoo, the words being used seem to have gone to entirely new levels.</p>

<p>I am interested in understanding what it is an API does. I want to go from zero to understanding in 2.34 seconds. I don’t want to wade through marketing, and documentation to understand what an API does. I want to find simple, concise language that properly describes an API. In the world of artificial intelligence, this can be difficult to do, and is something that varies from provider to provider. Some machine learning API providers are better at describing what they do, while others seem to prefer hype, and fluff when it comes to explaining what is actually possible.</p>

<p>As I continue my work profiling <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://microsoft.stack.network/">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="http://google.stack.network/">Google APIs</a> I want to develop an approach to helping me separate what an API does, and what a provider says it does. I am going to continue profiling each API <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">using OpenAPI</a>, and labeling them with a common set of tags I’m using to quantify what machine learning APIs actually do. As I’m doing this I also decided to add an extra tag field called x-hype-tags, which gives me a way to track each of the additional words I found in the marketing and documentation, that I may not be actually using to describe what the API does–maintaining much of the API providers intent.</p>

<p>One thing that contributes to the confusion of what is machine learning is that, very similar to APIs, it can be almost anything. While packaged in many different ways, most of the major machine learning providers have a machine learning engine for training and executing models, as well as some ready to go models that accomplish some common ML tasks for developers. Here are the primary machine learning engines I’ve been profiling out of the major cloud providers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/"><strong>Amazon Machine Learning</strong></a> - Amazon Machine Learning is a service that makes it easy for developers of all skill levels to use machine learning technology.</li>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/ml/"><strong>Google Machine Learning</strong></a> - Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine is a managed service that enables you to easily build machine learning models that work on any type of data, of any size</li>
  <li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/"><strong>Azure Machine Learning</strong></a> - A fully-managed cloud service that enables you to easily build, deploy, and share predictive analytics solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am going to be profiling these engines in their own way, but before I understand the infinite possibilities, I want to better understand the finite possibilities with each of these machine learning platforms. To help me develop a way of tagging, and quantifying what APIs do, and the hype around them I took a single type of machine learning API from each of these providers, and augmented their OpenAPI with more descriptive tagging.</p>

<p>To begin, I started with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/?hp=tile&amp;so-exp=below">Amazon’s Rekognition API</a>, crafting a basic OpenAPI that outlines the technical details of each possible API request and response, with the added tagging describing what the API does:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/a5b721d555e92aa81cf386a6f85c8e09.js"></script>

<p>Then I went through <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/">Azure’s Computer Vision</a>, crafting a basic OpenAPI that outlines the technical details of each possible API request and response, with the added tagging describing what the API does:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/cc69c6f6a25cbe6ae021941e45fb2f31.js"></script>

<p>Then last I look at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/">Google’s Cloud Vision API</a>, crafting a basic OpenAPI that outlines the technical details of each possible API request and response, with the added tagging describing what the API does:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/a559ae524f321167d708e229c9792e23.js"></script>

<p>These OpenAPIs aren’t 100% complete. I’m more concerned with developing the tagging schema for use across many APIs, than I am with the perfect OpenAPI. I’ll publish them to Github and continue to evolve, polish, and work to make each OpenAPI as complete as possible. I’m looking to settle in on a schema, before I got to work adding the extra x-hype-tags to additional OpenAPIs, pushing beyond what OpenAPI 2.0 dictates when it comes to API tagging. I’ll use the primary tags for each OpenAPI as the distilled down categorization of what each ML API does, while the x-hype-tags will give me a summary of what is used in the marketing copy, and the API documentation for each ML API provider.</p>

<p>It is important to me that I can quickly pull up APIs that accomplish specific business tasks–this requires each API to be tagged well. I also want to be able to apply some sort of hype score to each API, which reflects the number of adjectives and buzzwords in use in marketing and documentation. I feel these x-hype-tags reflect the hype in ML API space, and the tags reflect the realities of what ML APIs are actually capable of doing. When I profile new ML APIs I will be adding any word that catches my eye to the x-hype-tags, but I will be thinking about more deeply, and more carefully evolving the core set of more meaningful APIs I am using to categorize the ML APIs I track on.</p>

<p>Once I profile Amazon, Microsoft’s, and Google’s ML APIs in this way I am going to go through <a href="http://algorithmia.com">Algorithmia</a>, and other leading ML API providers and profiling their APIs, adding to both my core machine learning tagging vocabulary, as well as my machine learning hype tagging dictionary. Then I’ll step back a little and think about the bigger picture of the words we are choosing to describe our ML APIs. I am looking to develop a better way to be cataloging the types of ML APIs out there, and understand the language API providers are choosing to use when they describe what it is that they deliver. We need to be able to make sense of the ML APIs we already have, as well as each of the upcoming waves of AI and ML voodoo that is being developed right now, and due to be unleashed on the world in coming years.</p>

<p>I’m continuing <a href="http://ipaas.apievangelist.com">my integration platform as a service (iPaaS) research</a>, understanding <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/02/making-sure-your-api-service-connects-to-other-stops-along-lifecycle/">how API providers are quickly integration with other platform</a>, I am also looking into how API service providers are opening up their services to the entire API lifecycle. I’m seeing API service provides offer up a default set of integrations with other platforms, ad in some cases using Zapier by default–opening up 750+ other API driven platforms pretty quickly. Another dimension of this that I’m tracking on is when API service providers offer up plugin infrastructure, allowing other platforms to develop plug and play integrations that any platform user can take advantage of.</p>

<p>You can see this in action over at my partner Tyk, who has <a href="https://tyk.io/features/extend-tyk/">a nice set of plugins for their API management solution</a>. They start with three language focused middleware plugins allowing you to write scripts in Java, Lua, and JavaScript. Then they offer two gRPC plugins, which might be another post all by itself. While very similar to the iPaaS, or custom integration solution I’ve seen from other API providers, I’m going to be categorizing plugin approaches to integration like this separately, because it invites developers to come develop integrations as plugin–something that is very API in my book.</p>

<p><a href="http://plugin.apievangelist.com/">I’ve added a separate research area to tune into what types of integrations platforms are introducing via plugin infrastructure</a>. I’m trying to understand how plugins are evolving from being more about platform, browser, and other common forms and becoming more API lifecycle middleware (for lack of better term), like Tyk. I want to be aware of each of their approaches, and how different stops along the API lifecycle are embedding scripting engines, injecting integrated features into operations, and making it part of any continuous integration and deployment workflow(s). Like the other areas of my API lifecycle research, I will stop in from time to time, and understand if plugin API infrastructure is evolving and becoming more of a thing.</p>

<p>I’m spending a significant amount of time learning about machine learning APIs lately. Some of what I’m reading is easy to follow, while most of it is not. A good deal of what I’m reading is technically complex, and more on the documentation side of the conversation. Other stuff I come across is difficult to read, not because it is technical, but because it is more algorithmic marketing magic, and doesn’t really get at what is really going on (or not) under the hood.</p>

<p>If you are in the business of writing marketing copy, documentation, or even the API design itself, please work extra hard to keep things simple and in plain language. I read so much hype, jargon, fluff, and meaningless content about artificial intelligence and machine learning each day, I take pleasure anytime I find simple, concise, and information descriptions of what ML APIs do. In an exploding world of machine learning hype your products will stand out if they are straight up, and avoid the BS, which will pretty quickly turn off the savvy folks to whatever you are peddling.</p>

<p>Really, this advice applies to any API, not just machine learning. It’s just the quantity of hype we are seeing around AI and ML in 2017 is reaching some pretty extreme levels. Following the hype is easy. Writing fluffy content doesn’t take any skills. Writing simple, concise, plain language names, descriptions, and other meta data for artificial intelligence and machine learning APIs takes time, and a significant amount of contemplation regarding the message you want to be sending. The ML APIs I come across that get right to the point, are always the ones that stick around in my mind, and find a place within my research and storytelling.</p>

<p>We are going to continue to see an explosion in the number of algorithmic APIs, delivering across the artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, cognitive, and other magical realms. The APIs that deliver real business value will survive. The ones that have simple intuitive titles, and concise yet informative description that avoid hype and buzz will be the ones that get shared, reused, and ultimately float to the top of the pile and sticking around. I’m spending upwards of 5-10 hours a week looking through AI and ML API descriptions, and when I come across something that is clearly bullshit I don’t hesitate to flag, and push it back to the back warehouses of my research, keeping my time focused on the APIs which I can easily articulate what they do, and will also make sense to my readers.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/08/03/api-discovery-using-json-home/">API Discovery Using JSON Home</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">03 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-json-home-06"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/json-home/json-home-widget-example.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I’m have finally dedicated some time to learning more about <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-json-home-06">Home Documents for HTTP APIs, or simply JSON Home</a>. I see JSON Home as a nice way to bring together the technical components for an API, very similar to what I’ve been trying to accomplish with APIs.json. One of the biggest differences I see is that I’d say APIs.json was born out of the world of open data and APIs, where JSON Home is born of the web (which actually makes better sense).</p>

<p>I think the JSON Home description captures the specifications origins very well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Web itself offers one way to address these issues, using links [RFC3986] to navigate between states.  A link-driven application discovers relevant resources at run time, using a shared vocabulary of link relations [RFC5988] and internet media types [RFC6838] to support a “follow your nose” style of interaction - just as a Web browser does to navigate the Web.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>JSON Home provides any potential client with a machine readable set of instructions it can follow, involving one, or many APIs–providing a starting page for APIs which also enables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Extensibility - Because new server capabilities can be expressed as link relations, new features can be layered in without introducing a new API version; clients will discover them in the home document.</li>
  <li>Evolvability - Likewise, interfaces can change gradually by introducing a new link relation and/or format while still supporting the old ones.</li>
  <li>Customisation - Home documents can be tailored for the client, allowing different classes of service or different client permissions to be exposed naturally.</li>
  <li>Flexible deployment - Since URLs aren’t baked into documentation, the server can choose what URLs to use for a given service.</li>
</ul>

<p>JSON Home, is a home page specification which uses JSON to provide APIs with a a launching point for the interactions they offer, by providing a coherent set links, all wrapped in a single machine readable index. Each JSON begins with a handful of values:</p>

<ul>
  <li>title - a string value indicating the name of the API</li>
  <li>links - an object value, whose member names are link relation types [RFC5988], and values are URLs [RFC3986].</li>
  <li>author - a suitable URL (e.g., mailto: or https:) for the author(s) of the API</li>
  <li>describedBy - a link to documentation for the API</li>
  <li>license - a link to the legal terms for using the API</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have the general details about the JSON Home API index, you can provide a collection of resource objects possessing links that can be indicated using an href property with a URI value, or template links which uses a URI template. Just like a list of links on a home page, but instead of a browser, it can be used in any client, for a variety of different purposes.</p>

<p>Each of the resources allow for resource hints, which allow clients to obtain relevant information about interacting with a resource beforehand, as a means of optimizing communications, as well as sharing which behaviors will be available for an API. Here are the default hints available for JSON Home:</p>

<ul>
  <li>allow - Hints the HTTP methods that the current client will be able to use to interact with the resource; equivalent to the Allow HTTP response header.</li>
  <li>formats - Hints the representation types that the resource makes available, using the GET method.</li>
  <li>accept-Patch - Hints the PATCH [RFC5789] request formats accepted by the resource for this client; equivalent to the Accept-Patch HTTP response header.</li>
  <li>acceptPost  - Hints the POST request formats accepted by the resource for this client.</li>
  <li>acceptPut - Hints the PUT request formats accepted by the resource for this client.</li>
  <li>acceptRanges - Hints the range-specifiers available to the client  for this resource; equivalent to the Accept-Ranges HTTP response header [RFC7233].</li>
  <li>acceptPrefer - Hints the preferences [RFC7240] supported by the resource.  Note that, as per that specifications, a preference can be ignored by the server.</li>
  <li>docs - Hints the location for human-readable documentation for the relation type of the resource.</li>
  <li>preconditionRequired - Hints that the resource requires state-changing requests (e.g., PUT, PATCH) to include a precondition, as per [RFC7232], to avoid conflicts due to concurrent updates.</li>
  <li>authSchemes- Hints that the resource requires authentication using the HTTP Authentication Framework [RFC7235].</li>
  <li>status -  Hints the status of the resource.</li>
</ul>

<p>These hints provide you with a base set of the most commonly used sets of information, but then there is also a HTTP resource hint registration where all hints are registered. Hints can be added, allowing for the addition of custom defined hints, providing additional information beforehand about what can be expected from a resource link included as part of a JSON Home index. It is a much more sophisticated approach describing the behaviors of links than we included in APIs.json, with the formal hint registry being very useful and well-defined.</p>

<p>I”d say that JSON Home has all the features for defining a single, or collections of APIs, but really reflects its roots in the web, and possesses a heavy focus on enabling action with each link. While this is part of the linking structure of APIs.json, I feel like the detail and the mandate for action around each resource in a JSON Home index is much stronger. I feel like JSON Home is in the same realm as Postman Collections, but when it comes to API discovery. I always feel like a Postman Collection is more transactional than OpenAPI is by default. There is definitely overlap, but Postman Collections always feels one or two step closer to some action being taken than OpenAPI does–I am guessing it is because of it’s client roots, similar to the web roots of JSON Home, and also OpenAPIs roots in documentation.</p>

<p>Ok. Yay! I have Pivio, and now JSON Home both loaded in my brain. I have a feel for what they are trying to accomplish, and have found some interesting layers I hadn’t considered while doing my APIs.json centered API discovery work. Now I can step back, and consider the features of all three of these API discovery formats, establish a rough Venn diagram of their features, and consider how they overlap, and compliment each other. I feel like we are moving towards an important time for API discovery, and with the growing number of APIs available we will see more investment in API discovery specifications, as well as services and tooling that help us with API discovery. I’ll keep working to understand what is going on, establish at least a general understanding of each API discovery specifications, and report back here about what is happening when I can.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/services/api-discovery.png" align="right" width="30%" style="padding: 15px" /></p>
<p>I was learning about <a href="http://pivio.io/">the microservices discovery specification Pivio</a>, which is a schema for framing the conversation, but also an uploader, search, and web interface for managing a collection of microservices. I found their use of ElasticSearch as the search engine for their tooling worth thinking about more. When we first launched <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, we created <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> as the search engine–providing a custom developed public API search engine. I hadn’t thought of using ElasticSearch as an engine for searching APIs.json treated as a JSON document.</p>

<p>Honestly, I have been relying on the Github API as the search engine for my API discovery. Using it to uncover not just APIs.json, but OpenAPI, API Blueprint, and other API specification formats. This works well for public discovery, but I could see ElasticSearch being a quick and dirty way to launch a private or public engine for an API discovery, catalog, directory, or type of collection. I will add ElasticSearch, and other platforms I track on as part of my <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment research</a> as a <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery building block</a>, evolving the approaches I’m tracking on.</p>

<p>It is easy to think of API discovery as directories like ProgrammableWeb, or marketplaces like Mashape, and public API search engines like APIs.io–someone else’s discovery vehicle, which you are allowed to drive when you need. However, when you begin to consider other types of API discovery search engines, you realize that a collection of API discovery documents like JSON Home, Pivio, and APIs.json can quickly become your own personal API discovery vehicle. I’m going to write a separate piece on how I use Github as my API discovery engine, then I think I’ll step back and look at other approaches to searching JSON or YAML documents to see if I can find any search engines that might be able to be fine tuned specifically for API discovery.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://pivio.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/pivio/pivio-microservice-documentation-for-your-platform.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I’m finally feeling the ground move in the area of <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a> a little bit. It is an area I’m perpetually trying to create my own seismic activity with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, but it always makes me happy to see other folks contributing to the conversation in a significant way. My friend Erik Wilde (<a href="https://twitter.com/dret">@dret</a>) turned me onto <a href="http://pivio.io/">Pivio for microservice discovery</a>, providing a machine readable approach to API discovery that resembles what I’ve been trying to do with APIs.json, but has several very interesting service-centric characteristics.</p>

<p>According to the project website Pivio is a “description in your source code with all the metadata of your service describing itself. This can be as simple as the name, owner and VCS information as well as useful information about runtime environment, used licenses and service dependencies. Pivio is a service registry for humans.” Pivio is a microservice discovery schema, and a web platform for uploading, searching, and viewing your catalog of microservices. It is in alpha version, but already provides a very interesting take on discovery from the microservices perspective.</p>

<p>Pivio begins with a common set of mandatory fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>id - Unique id in pivio. You can ask the pivio service for a unique id.</li>
  <li>name - The name of the artifact. This is intended for humans.</li>
  <li>short_name - A very brief name for the service.</li>
  <li>type - The type of this artifact. Values could be service, library or mobile_app.</li>
  <li>owner - Which team is responsible for this artifact.</li>
  <li>description - What does this service do?</li>
</ul>

<p>Next Pivio begins to break out some interesting collections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact - Who should be contacted if one has a question.</li>
  <li>vcs - Where is the location of source code that runs this service.</li>
  <li>tags - Add tags for organizing each service as part of larger collection.</li>
  <li>lifecycle - In which lifecycle is this component? Only in development, in production or out of service.</li>
  <li>links - All sort of links which might be interesting. Candidates are homepage, buildchain, api docs</li>
</ul>

<p>Then Pivio breaks out some very useful service-focused collections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provides - What and where does this artifact provides services? description Should be a human readable description. service_name is the unique identification of the particular interface. port, protocol and transport_protocol are self describing.</li>
  <li>Dependences
    <ul>
      <li>internal - To which other service_name (from provides) services does this service talk?</li>
      <li>external - To which external target needs this artifact to talk to? This is meant to show if 		this service talks to another one outside of your system, like a public API of another service 		provider ‘in the cloud’.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Service Context
    <ul>
      <li>belongs_to_bounded_context - General rule is that every service belongs to a bounded context.</li>
      <li>visibility
  	- private: intended usage is only by the owner
        <ul>
          <li>public: exposes an api for other owners.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Runtime
    <ul>
      <li>cpu - the size of the processor
        <ul>
          <li>ram - how much memory it has</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>disk - what is the size of disk</li>
      <li>host_type - metal, vm, docker</li>
      <li>network_zone - dmz, backend, core, database</li>
      <li>environment - development, test, production</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Software Dependencies - Name, versions, licensing of the software behind each of the services.</li>
  <li>Custom extensions - Have your own keys in this configuration you can simply add your own key word/yaml file.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are overlapping elements of Pivio and API.json, and you can accomplish man similar things with both API discovery formats, but Pivio brings to the table a serious technical view of APIs through a microservice lens. I am really interested in the context, dependencies, and like the runtime, and extension part as well. I think the lifecycle, VCS, and CI/CD aspects of the Pivio schema points to a more meaningful discovery approach in coming years.</p>

<p>Pivio has several supporting open source tools built on the microservices discovery schema which are available from the Github repository at: https://github.com/pivio/:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Client: https://github.com/pivio/pivio-client</li>
  <li>Server: https://github.com/pivio/pivio-server</li>
  <li>Web: https://github.com/pivio/pivio-web</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not that interested in the client, server, and web applications just yet. I’d like to think more about the context, dependencies, lifecycle, VCS, CI/CD, and the search mechanism they are employing. I’m also going to spend some cycles this week getting up to speed on <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-json-home-03">JSON Home</a>, as well as Pivio. I’ve been trying to make some time to learn more about JSON Home lately, but just haven’t had the time. Now that I have Pivo on my desk, I’m kind of forced to make sure I can speak intelligenctly to both of these API discovery specification formats.</p>

<p>It is pretty easy to reference a pivio.yaml discovery document from within an APIs.json, and vice versa. They both allow for extensibility using links. After thinking about JSON Home a little bit, I want to try and establish some sort of Venn diagram of JSON Home, Pivio, and APIs.json to better understand where and when you’d want to use each format, and how they can overlap and work together. I feel like the world of APIs is finally maturing to a point where discovery is a growing pain point, so we are going to see more investment in a variety of approaches to helping make it easier to discover, and maintain rich catalogs of microservices and APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://apimetrics.io/google-location-map/">APIMetrics has a pretty addictive map showing the performance of API calls between multiple cloud providers, spanning many global regions</a>. The cloud location latency map “shows relative performance of a standard, reference GET request made to servers running on all the Google locations and via the Google global load balancer. Calls are made from AWS, Azure, IBM and Google clouds and data is stored for all steps of the API call process and the key percentiles under consideration.”</p>

<p align="center"><a href="http://apimetrics.io/google-location-map/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-metrics/apimetrics-cloud-location-performance-map.png" align="center" width="80%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>

<p>It is interesting to play with the destination of the API calls, changing the region, and visualizing how API calls begin to degrade to different regions. It really sets the stage for how we should start thinking about the deployment, monitoring, and testing of our APIs. Region, by region, getting to know where our consumers are, and making sure APIs are deployed within the cloud infrastructure that delivers the best possible performance. It’s not just testing your APIs in a single location from many locations, it is also rethinking where your APIs are deployed, leveraging a multi-cloud reality and using all the top cloud provider, while also making API deployment by region a priority.</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of what APIMetrics is doing with the API performance visualizations and mapping. However, I think their approach to using HTTPbin is a significant part of this approach to monitoring and visualizing API performance at the multi-cloud level, while also making much of the process and data behind it all public. I want to put some more thought into how they are using HTTPbin behind this approach to multi-cloud API performance monitoring. I feel like there is potential her for applying this beyond just API performance, and think about other testing, security, and critical aspects of reliability and doing business online with APIs today.</p>

<p>After thinking where else this HTTPbin approach to data gathering could be applied, I want to think more about how the data behind APIMetrics cloud location latency map can be injected into other conversations, when it comes where we are deploying APIs, and running our API tests. Eventually I would like to see this type of multi-cloud API performance data alongside data for security and privacy compliance data, and even the regulations of each country as they apply to specific industries. Think about a time when we can deploy our APIs exactly where we want them based upon performance, privacy, security, regulations, and other critical aspects of doing business in the Internet age.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/real-time-bidding-transparency-via-ads-txt/">I was learning about real-time bidding transparency using Ads.txt from Lukasz Olejnik</a>. The mission of the ads.txt project is to “<a href="https://iabtechlab.com/ads-txt/">increase transparency in the programmatic advertising ecosystem. Ads.txt stands for Authorized Digital Sellers and is a simple, flexible and secure method that publishers and distributors can use to publicly declare the companies they authorize to sell their digital inventory.</a>” While Ads.txt isn’t an API, it is an open, machine readable definition that is working to make advertising more transparent and observable to everyone, not just people in the ad-tech space.</p>

<p>Ads.txt works similar to robots.txt, and is a simple text file that lives in the root of a domain, listing the companies that have permission to sell advertising. The format is new, so there isn’t a lot of adoption yet, but <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/ads.txt">you can see one in action over at the Washington Post</a>. Helping make platforms observable is why I perform as the API Evangelist. I see them as one of the important tools we have for making systems, algorithms, and platforms more observable, and less of a black box. I see ads.txt having similar potential for the world of advertising, and something that eventually could have an API, for helping make sense of the very distributed, brokered, and often dark world of online advertising.</p>

<p>Honestly, I know almost nothing about online advertising. I have a basic level of understanding of Google Analytics, Adwords, and Adsense, as well as reading the blogs, and documentation for many advertising APIs I come across in my regular monitoring of the API space. I am just interested in ads.txt as an agent of observability, and pulling back the current on who is buying and selling our digital bits online. I am adding ads.txt to <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">my API definitions research</a>. This will allow me to keep an eye on the project, see where it goes, and think about the API level for aggregation of the ad network data, on maybe Github or something–caching ads.txt on a daily basis. Who knows where it will go. I’ll just keep learning, and playing around until it comes into a little more focus.</p>

<p>I’m guessing that not all companies will want to be transparent like this. Folks who have the upper hand, or are just doing shady things, rarely like to have the curtain pulled back. I’ll keep an eye ads.txt adoption, and also spend some time thinking thinking about transparency and observability at the API monetization and plans level, going beyond just advertising, which is the staple of the web, and think about how we can keep things open when it comes to API business models.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2017</span>
        <p>I am taking a deeper look at Open311, as part of some wider municipal level API research and development I am doing. I am going to be helping evolve an OpenAPI for the project, as well as JSON schema for the API and underlying data model. As I’m working my way through the Open311 portal reacquainting myself with the open format for reporting of non-emergency issues within cities, I came across the list of cities who have implemented Open311, and get a glimpse at what the future of APIs at the city level can be.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2/Servers/">When you land on the Open311 GeoReport v2 Servers listing page you get a table of the twenty-one cities who have published an Open311 API</a>, with the name, country, API discovery document, API key request location, documentation, production and sandbox environment URLs. Twenty-one separate cities, twenty-one separate APIs for reporting non-emergency issues, all using the same API definition. This is the way that all APIs at the city, county, state, and federal levels should work. They should leverage common schema and API definition, providing a federated list of resources that can be integrated into any application.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2/Servers/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/open311/open311-api-list.png" width="80%" style="padding: 15px;" align="center" /></a></p>

<p>Imagine when all cities have a common 311 API for reporting of non-emergency issues, as well as a 211 API for finding human services within a city. Imagine when the entire stack of city services all use common API definition(s), and schema across all API requests and responses. In this environment any city will be able take existing SDKs, or open source application, tools, or plugin, and put to work for a new city, with little or no changes. This is the way city, county, state, and federal agency software and application development should work. There should be a buffet of open source solutions for each layer of government operations.</p>

<p>When it comes to this level of API operations within cities, Open311 is the furthest along down the road in the journey. This is why I want to help them further develop the OpenAPI, and supporting JSON schemas, take a look at their overall portal, and operations, to see where else I can lend a hand, and contribute to their momentum. I am looking to bring Open311 alignment with the work I am doing on the Open Referral Human Services Data API, which is essentially Open211. It’s gonna take me a few weeks to get up to speed on everything going on with Open311, and find the bandwidth to work on the OpenAPI, and JSON schema, alongside <a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">my Human Services API work</a>, but I am invested in seeing both these open government API standards move forward, and enjoy wider adoption by cities around the world, so I will find the time somewhere.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.runscope.com/docs/api-testing/integrations"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/runscope/runscope-connected-services.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px; " /></a></p>
<p>I am continuing <a href="http://ipaas.apievangelist.com/">my integration platform as a service research</a>, and spending a little bit of time trying to understand how API providers are offering up integrations with other APIs. Along the way, I also wanted to look at how API service providers are doing it as well, opening themselves up to other stops along n API lifecycle. To understand how API service providers are allowing their users to easily connect to other services I’m taking a look at how my partners are handling this, starting with <a href="https://www.runscope.com/docs/api-testing/integrations">connected services at Runscope</a>.</p>

<p>Runscope provides ready to go integration of their API monitoring and testing services with twenty other platforms, delivering a pretty interesting Venn diagram of services along the API lifecycle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Slack - Slack to receive notifications from Runscope API test results and Traffic Alerts.</li>
  <li>Datadog  - Datadog to create events and metrics from Runscope API test results.</li>
  <li>Splunk Cloud  - Splunk Cloud to create events for API test results.</li>
  <li>PagerDuty  - A PagerDuty service to trigger and resolve incidents based on Runscope API test results or Traffic Alerts.</li>
  <li>Amazon Web Services   - Amazon Web Services to import tests from API Gateway definitions.</li>
  <li>Ghost Inspector  - Ghost Inspector to run UI tests from within your Runscope API tests.</li>
  <li>New Relic Insights - New Relic Insights to create events from Runscope API test results.</li>
  <li>Microsoft Teams  - Microsoft Teams to receive notifications from Runscope API test results.</li>
  <li>HipChat  - HipChat to receive notifications from Runscope API test results and Traffic Alerts.</li>
  <li>StatusPage.io - StatusPage.io to create metrics from Runscope API test results.</li>
  <li>Big Panda - Big Panda to create alerts from Runscope API test results.</li>
  <li>Keen IO - Keen IO to create events from Runscope API test results.</li>
  <li>VictorOps - A VictorOps service to trigger and resolve incidents based on Runscope API test results or Traffic Alerts.</li>
  <li>Flowdock - Flowdock to receive notifications from Runscope API test results and Traffic Alerts.</li>
  <li>AWS CodePipeline - Integrate your Runscope API tests into AWS CodePipeline.</li>
  <li>Jenkins  - Trigger a test run on every build with the Jenkins Runscope plugin.</li>
  <li>Zapier - integrate with 250+ services like HipChat, Asana, BitBucket, Jira, Trello and more.</li>
  <li>OpsGenie - OpsGenie to send alerts from Runscope API test results.</li>
  <li>Grove  - Grove to send messages to your IRC channels from Runscope API test results and Traffic Alerts.</li>
  <li>CircleCI  - Run your API tests after a completed CircleCI build.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone can integrate <a href="https://www.runscope.com/docs/api">API monitoring and testing into operation using the Runscope API</a>, but these twenty services are available by default to any user, immediately opening up several important layers of our API operations. Immediately you see the messaging, notifications, chat, and other support layers. Then you see the continuous integration / deployment, code, and SDK layers. Then you come across Zapier, which opens up a whole other world of endless integration possibilities. I see <a href="https://www.runscope.com">Runscope</a> owning the monitoring, testing, and performance stops along the API lifecycle, but their connected services puts other stops like deployment, management, logging, analysis, and many others also within reach.</p>

<p>I am working on a way to track the integrations between API providers, and API service providers. I’d like to be able to visualize the relationships between providers, helping me see the integrations that are most important to different groups of end users. I’m a big advocate for API providers to put iPaaS services like <a href="https://zapier.com/app/explore">Zapier</a> and <a href="https://github.com/DataFire">DataFire</a> to work, opening up a whole world of integrations to their developers and end users. I also encourage API service providers to work to understand how Zapier can open up other stops along the API lifecycle. Next, everyone should be thinking about deeper integrations like Runscope is doing with their connected services, and make sure you always publish a public page showcasing integrations, making it part of documentation, SDKs, and other aspects of your API service platform.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/07/10/opportunity-to-develop-a-threat-intelligence-apis-json/">I wrote about the opportunity around developing an aggregate threat information API</a>, and got some interest in both creating, as well as investing in some of the resulting products and services that would be derived from this security API work. As part of the feedback and interest on that post, I was pointed in the direction of the <a href="https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/">Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX)</a>, a structured language for cyber threat intelligence, and <a href="https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/">Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII)</a>, and transport mechanism for sharing cyber threat intelligence.</p>

<p>This is why I write about my projects openly like this, so that my readers can help me identify existing approaches for tackling whatever I am focusing on. I prefer to never reinvent the wheel, and build on top of any existing work that is already available. I’m thinking the next step is to craft an OpenAPI fo TAXII, and STIX. Creating a machine readable blueprint for deploying, managing, and documenting a threat intelligence API. I couldn’t find any existing work on an OpenAPI definition, so this seems like a logical place to begin working to build on, and augment the work of <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti">the Cyber Threat Intelligence Technical Committee</a>. Clearly, the working group has created a robust set of specifications, but I’d like to help move it closer to implementation with an OpenAPI.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/threat-intelligence">I have created a Github organization to help organize any work on this project</a>. I have forked the project for STIX and TAXII there, as well as started <a href="https://github.com/threat-intelligence/planning">a planning repository</a> to coordinate any work I’m contributing to the conversation. I have also created a repository for working on and publishing the OpenAPI that will define the project. Once we have this, I’d like to start thinking about the development of a handful of server side implementations in maybe Node.js, Python, PHP, or other common programming language. Here are the next steps I’d like to see occur around this project:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>OpenAPI</strong> - Create an OpenAPI for STIX and TAXII to provide a single representation of a threat intelligence sharing API.</li>
  <li><strong>Threat List</strong> - Take the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/07/10/opportunity-to-develop-a-threat-intelligence-apis-json/">threat intelligence list I originally published</a>, and identify how any of the sources would map to OpenAPI.</li>
  <li><strong>Storytelling</strong> - Tell stories throughout the process to attract the attention of other players, contributors, and investors, so that this project can live on.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not looking to own this project 100%. I just don’t have the time and resources. However I do want to see an OpenAPI move forward, as well as a wealth of open source resources for deploying, integrating, and aggregating around threat intelligence sharing. This work is bigger than any single player, and is something that needs to be open, spanning thousands of providers, not controlled by a handful of gatekeepers. Players in the threat intelligence sharing game need to be able to decide who they consume and share threat intelligence with, something that will require a federated world of APIs that all speak in a common language. <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti">The Cyber Threat Intelligence Technical Committee</a> is off to a great start. I just want to contribute with some cycles to help bring their work in alignment with what is going on in the mainstream world of APIs, while also beating a drum so that I can bring more attention to any work going on in this important area. Our world is going to need significant investment in the area of threat intelligence sharing if we are going to be successful online in coming years.</p>

<p>I was looking through a number of federal government API implementations last week in preparation of a talk I did in Washington DC. The result of research like this is always a notebook full of interesting stories to tell about what federal agencies are up to with APIs. Today’s story is out of the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), with <a href="https://www.eia.gov/opendata/excel/">their Excel Data Add-In and Google Add-On tooling</a> which allows you to download energy data from <a href="https://www.eia.gov/opendata/">EIA’s data API</a> and economic data from <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/">the St. Louis Federal Reserve’s Economic Data (FRED) API</a> directly into your spreadsheet(s).</p>

<p>I’m regularly looking out for innovative uses of spreadsheets when it comes to deploying, as well as consuming APIs, because I believe it is the best way we have to turn average business users into API consumers, by piping in data into the environment they are already using each day. EIA’s data API contains 1.6 million energy series, and the St. Louis Federal Reserve’s API contains 240,000 economic series. Making valuable federal agency maintained data available within spreadsheets like this using APIs is something ALL other agencies should be emulating. First, agencies need to be doing public APIs, then they need to make sure they are also investing in spreadsheet tooling like the EIA is.</p>

<p>I’m adding this example of using Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets as an API client for not just federal government, but also for such valuable commerce and energy data, to <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com/">my APIs and spreadsheets research</a>. I’m also going to be on the hunt for open source solutions for delivering spreadsheet API connectivity like this. There should be a wealth of open source tooling that federal agencies can put to work when it comes to delivering data to spreadsheets, both internally, and externally with private sector partners. In a time where it is easy to get pretty depressed on a daily basis about APIs in the federal government, it makes me happy to find shining examples of APIs being put to work in such meaningful, and useful ways.</p>

<p>I have been watching <a href="https://www.versioneye.com/">VersionEye</a> for a while now. If you aren’t familiar, they provide a service that will notify you of security vulnerabilities, license violations and out-dated dependencies in your Git repositories. I wanted to craft a story specifically about their licensing notification services, which can check all your open source dependencies against a license white list, then notify you of violations, and changes at the SDK licensing level.</p>

<p>The first thing I like here, is the notion of an API SDK licensing whitelist. The idea that there is a service that could potentially let you know which API providers have SDKs that are licensed in a way that meets your integration requirements. I think it helps developers who are building applications on top of APIs understand which APIs they should or shouldn’t be using based upon SDK licensing, while also providing an incentive for API providers to get their SDKs organized, including the licensing–you’d be surprised at how many API providers do not have their SDK house in order.</p>

<p>VersionEye also provides CI/CD integration, so that you can stop a build based on a licensing violation. Injecting the politics of API operations, from an API consumers perspective, into the application lifecycle. I’m interested in VersionEye’s CI/CD, as well as security vulnerabilities, but I wanted to make sure this approach to keeping an eye on SDK licensing was included in my <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com">SDK</a>, <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com">monitoring</a>, and <a href="http://licensing.apievangelist.com">licensing</a> research, influencing my storytelling across these areas. Some day all API providers will have a wide variety of SDKs available, each complete with clear licensing, published on Github, and indexed as part of an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. We just aren’t quite there yet, and we need more services like VersionEye to help build awareness at the API SDK licensing level to get us closer to this reality.</p>

<p>I recently wrote about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/07/10/opportunity-to-develop-a-threat-intelligence-apis-json/">the opportunity around developing an aggregate threat information API</a>, and got some interest in both creating, as well as investing in some of the resulting products and services that would be derived from this security API work. As part of the feedback and interest on that post, I was pointed in the direction of <a href="https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/">the Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII)</a>, as one possible approach to defining a common set of API definitions and tooling for the exchange of threat intelligence.</p>

<p>The description of TAXII from the project website describes it well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII) is an application layer protocol for the communication of cyber threat information in a simple and scalable manner. TAXII is a protocol used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI) over HTTPS. TAXII enables organizations to share CTI by defining an API that aligns with common sharing models. TAXII is specifically designed to support the exchange of CTI represented in STIX.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I breezed through <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eyhS3-fOlRkDB6N39Md6KZbvbCe3CjQlampiZPg-5u4/edit#heading=h.4do73o99e2l7">the documentation for TAXII version 2.0</a>, and it looks pretty robust, and a project that has made some significant inroads towards accomplishing what I’d like to see out there for sharing threat intelligence. I’m still understanding the overlap of TAXII, the transport mechanism for sharing cyber threat intelligence, and STIX, the structured language for cyber threat intelligence, but it looks like a robust, existing approach defining the schema and an API for sharing threat intelligence.</p>

<p>Next, I am going to gather my thoughts around both of these existing definitions, and look at establishing an OpenAPI that represents STIX and TAXII, providing a machine readable definition for sharing threat intelligence. I think having an OpenAPI will provide a blueprint that can be used to define a handful of server side implementations in a variety of programming languages. I was happy to be directed to this existing work, saving me significant time and energy when it comes to this conversation. Now I don’t have to jumpstart it, I just have to contribute to, and augment the work that is already going on.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Jul 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/06/14/gsa-api-standards-with-working-prototype-api-and-portal/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/gsa/gsa-prototype-api-portal.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I wrote about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/06/14/gsa-api-standards-with-working-prototype-api-and-portal/">the GSA API prototype the other day</a>. It is an API prototype developed by the GSA, providing an API that is designed in alignment with <a href="https://tech.gsa.gov/guides/API_standards/">GSA API design guidelines</a>, complete with an API portal for delivering documentation, and other essential resources any API deployment will need. The GSA provides us with an important approach to delivering open source blueprints that other federal agencies can fork, reverse engineer and deploy as their own custom API implementation.</p>

<p>We need more of this in the private sector. We need a whole buffet of APIs that do a variety of different things, in every language, and platform or stack that we can imagine. Need a contact directory API, or maybe a document storage API, URL shortener API–here is a forkable, downloadable, open source solution you can put to work immediately. We need the WordPress for APIs. Not the CMS interface WordPress is known for, just a simple API that is open source, and can be easily deployed by anyone in any common hosting, and serverless environments. Making the deployment of common API patterns a no-brainer, and something anyone can do, anywhere in the cloud, on-premise, or on-device.</p>

<p>Even though these little bundles of API deployment joy would be open source, there would be a significant amount of opportunity routing folks to other add-on, and premium services on top of any open source API deployment, as well as providing cloud deployment opportunities for developers–similar to the separation between WordPress.com and WordPress.org. I could see a variety of service providers emerge that could cater to the API deployment needs of various industries. Some could focus on more data specific solutions, while others could focus on content, or even more algorithmic, machine learning-focused API deployment solutions.</p>

<p>If linked data, hypermedia, gRPC, and GraphQL practitioners want to see more adoption in their chosen protocol, they should be publishing, evolving, and maintaining robust, reverse engineer-able, forkable, open source examples of the APIs they think companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies should be deploying. People emulate what they know, and see out there. From what I can tell, many API developers are pretty lazy, and aren’t always looking to craft the perfect API, but if they had a working example, tailored for exactly their use case (or close enough), I bet they would put it to work. I track on a lot of open source API frameworks, I am going to see if I can find more examples like the GSA prototype out there, where providers aren’t just delivering an API, they are delivering a complete package including API design, deployment, management, and a functional portal to act as the front door for API operations.</p>

<p>Delivering professional API deployment templates could prove to be a pretty interesting way to develop new customers who would also be looking for other API services that target other stops along the API lifecycle like API monitoring, testing, and continuous integration and deployment. I’ll keep my eye out for open source API deployment templates that fit the professional definition I’m talking about. I will also give a little nudge to some API service providers, consulting groups, and agencies I know who are targeting the API space, and see if I can’t stimulate the creation of some professional API deployment templates for some interesting use cases.</p>

<p>I have been immersed in how APIs are being done in the federal government for the last week or so, looking for positive API behavior I can showcase and focus on in my storytelling. I was walking through each step of my API lifecycle, sizing up the federal government for each area I track the private sector on when it comes to APIs. I was taking a look at the areas of microservices, containerization, and serverless. You know the modularization of IT infrastructure in government? I couldn’t find much rubber meeting the road when it comes to microservices or containerization in my research, but I did see hints of modularizing the business aspects of doing APIs in the federal government.</p>

<p><a href="https://modularcontracting.18f.gov/modular-procurement/">Over at 18F you can find some interesting discussion around micro-procurement</a>, “a procurement model that breaks what would traditionally be a large, monolithic contract into several shorter-term, lower dollar amount contracts.” I feel that breaking down the business of defining, designing, deploying, managing, and even testing your APIs into small projects is an important first step for many companies, organizations, institutions, and agencies. While not all organizations will be the same, many will need to break down the business of procuring API design, deployment, and management services, before they can even getting to work breaking down the technical components of what is needing to be delivered.</p>

<p>I have been working with <a href="https://skylight.digital/">my partners at Skylight</a> on our approach to breaking down and delivering API projects, discussing the technical, business, and political aspects of doing things in as modular, bite-size chunks as we possibly can. This involves exploring the other side of the micro-procurement coin, with <a href="https://fcw.com/blogs/lectern/2017/07/kelman-microconsulting.aspx">micro-consulting</a>, providing API related services in small, modular projects. I’m exploring the delivery of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/07/24/first-handful-of-lessons-using-my-google-sheet-github-approach/">API training and curriculum</a>, as well as white paper, guide, and other content-centric services using a micro-consulting approach–keeping engagements small, focused, and delivering additional services that support one or many individual API implementations.</p>

<p>Micro procurement and consulting isn’t a fit for every scenario, but I can see it working well when it comes to helping companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies thinking about how they can break projects down into smaller chunks, which will often involve delivering services across numerous stops along the API life cycle, from design to deprecation. Designing and deploying an API under a micro project approach limits the scope of what I’m able to deliver, easily keeping each API doing one thing, and (hopefully) doing it well. Making it easier for me to deliver microservices, complete with definitions, design guides, container, deployment, management layer, documentation, testing, and other essential elements for delivering APIs.</p>

<p>Someone asked me on Twitter recently how I deal the duplicate work required to manage a large volume of OpenAPIs. All the same things you have to do when crafting the headers, parameters, responses, and schema across every OpenAPI you are crafting. My response was that I don’t see these things as repetitive or duplicate work, I see these things as common patterns across the resources I am making available. They main reason I think they seem repetitive is the tooling we are currently using needs to play catch up, and help us better apply common patterns across all our APIs–dealing with the duplicate, repetitive work for us.</p>

<p>I’m confident that open source API design tooling like <a href="http://www.apicur.io/">Apicurio</a> are going to help us better manage the common patterns we should be applying across our OpenAPIs. I’m also hopeful that <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md">OpenAPI 3.0</a> contributes to reuse of parameters, schema, errors, and other common building blocks across the request and response surface of our API. I’m counting on OpenAPI + Apicurio as well as other API definition and design tooling to step up and do the hard work wen it comes to helping us manage the common patterns across our APIs, and make the reuse of common patterns across our APIs a good thing, and never a burden.</p>

<p>This reuse shouldn’t just being within any company, and we should be reusing and sharing patterns from across the space, including common web concepts and standards. The fact that you use ISO 8601 for all your dates, while employing a handful of date field names over and over across your systems isn’t repetition or duplicate work, that is consistency, and sensible reuse of common API patterns. It is the job of API design service and tooling providers to help us get over this hump, and craft notebooks, catalogs, collections, dictionaries, and stores of the common patterns we will need to be applying (over and over again) across our API definitions–OpenAPI.</p>

<p>I enjoy these regular reminders regarding how differently folks see the API space. I also enjoy the focus on the role that API specification formats and tooling will play in helping carry the load enough so folks don’t see detailed API definitions as a burden. I regularly come across OpenAPIs that you can tell are incomplete because someone was just doing the minimum amount of work they needed to deliver documentation for an API. It should be a no-brainer for API designers and developers to make sure there is always a robust, complete, and detailed OpenAPI for any existing API–while ensuring common patterns are applied at every turn.</p>

<p>APIs aren’t good, or bad, nor are they neutral. APIs do the bidding of their providers, and sometimes their consumers. In my experience APIs are more often used for bad than they are ever used for good, something I try to be as vocal as I can about, while working hard to shine a light on the good that is possible. After many years of trying to help folks understand APIs, one of the biggest challenges I face involves the unrealistic rhetoric of startups. The overoptimistic vision and promises of what APIs will do, coupled with an an often limiting awareness of the challenges and complexity of industries where APIs are targeting, making for a pretty toxic, non-cooperative environment for actually getting anything done.</p>

<p>I work hard to keep APIs alive in a variety of industries that have seen multiple waves of startups trumpeting their disruption and change horns, while also often belittling and underestimating the people within the industry. <a href="http://www.dcvelocity.com/articles/20170725-capital-amnesia/">I recently came across a post recently that captures the challenge we all face when we are looking to make change within established, and often entrenched industries using APIs</a>. I feel this paragraph captures it well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new players, and the venture capital/private equity money backing them, think they are entering a world full of Luddites. Yet the brokers we’ve talked to—and we know it’s not everybody—are quite IT-oriented. In a world where visibility is paramount, they are keenly aware of technology’s role in keeping them competitive. They are investing in IT and will continue to do so as prices drop. Meanwhile, many bring vast experience in mastering the physical part of the solution that the startups can’t touch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is interesting to come across this friction in the freight brokerage industry. It is something I’ve seen in industry after industry, and with each wave of startups doing APIs. In some spaces startups will find success, but in others they will find themselves stopped cold by the entrenched positions some technical groups possess. I have experience developing trucking and shipping web applications, and predict there will be endless waves of automation that impact the freight brokerage space in coming years. However, I think startups will do much better if they focus on partnering with folks already in the space, investing in the existing expertise, rather than just going with the classic disruption rhetoric we’ve seen.</p>

<p>I am fascinated by how APIs can lay the groundwork for collaboration and better access to resources, or they can also lead to the introduction of significant friction and disruption within a sector. I’m just glad there is discussion about the role funding plays when it comes to each players motivation within a particular industry, acknowledging the legacy debt owned by the entire sector, as well as the disruptive nature of upstarts when they don’t partner with, or leverage the existing domain expertise within a space. I’ll keep an eye on what is going on in the freight brokerage sector, and see if I can better understand how APIs are becoming the solution, or contributing to friction going down the road.</p>
