{% include JB/setup %}<p>Nike is working on a new API as part of their Nike Better World initative.The API provides access to a materials sustainability index, which evaluates the environmental impact of materials used by manufacturers.The scoring system evaluates the environmental impacts of materials used in products using a combination of materials-specific data, covering areas such as Chemistry, Energy and Greenhouse Gas Intensity, Water and Land Use Intensity, and Waste.The Nike Materials Sustainability Index API is only in alpha stage right now, and is undergoing for a peer review process with Duke University.You can follow their Nike Makerâ€™s Blog to get more information on the initiative and get notified when the API will be available to the public.</p>
