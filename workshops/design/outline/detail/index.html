					<h2 style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px;">API Design</h2>
			<p>API design is almost always considered to be solely about a RESTful approach to delivering APIs. While this is definitely the base of any API effort, and focusing on providing access to APIs using the web is critical, API design can also be about much more than just HTTP 1.1, and can include many other building blocks that should be considered as part of a larger API strategy, and standardized for easy training, adoption, and governance across teams.</p>

				<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Using definitions as the center of the API design process, developing an OpenAPI contract for moving things through the design phase, iterating, evolving, and making sure the definitions drive the business goals behind each service. Leveraging many different artifacts across the life cycle, but ultimately pushing to standardize, mature, and strengthen API definitions as proven business contracts.</p>

				<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">Conclusion</h3>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">As we conclude this newly emerged and evolving stop along the API lifecycle, there should be no code actually written for any API, that we are "designing". The goal with this area of the API lifecycle is to refine the machine, and human readable contract for each service we offer. Leaving us with the documentation, virtualization, assertions, scenarios, and machine readable OpenAPI contract to begin realizing this service as part of the development area of the lifecycle.</p>
