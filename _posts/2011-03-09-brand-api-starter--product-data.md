<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/brand-food.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" />I have been thinking about[Adam Kleinbergs][1] recent posts,[Why Every Brand Needs an Open API for Developers][2] and[Digging deeper on Brand APIs][3].

He's right. The pace of API development skyrocketed in 2010, and will continue in 2011.

Brands that don't have an API will be left behind.

Where does a company start? Start with what you know. Your products.

Make your product data available via a [RESTful][4] API. Provide the basics: Names, Descriptions, and Images.

Allow developers to sign up, and register for a key.

Provide simple documentation describing how to make calls against your API, sample code in PHP, Ruby, and Python.

Setup an [FAQ page][5], [blog][6], [forum][7], and support contact form.

Establish a clear [terms and conditions][8] page, with clear [brand guidelines][9] regarding how users can use your product data.

Brands should start simple, start with delivering basic information about your products through a RESTful API.

You never know what you'll learn!
