{% include JB/setup %}<p>I spend a lot of time looking through various APIs.One common problem I see, are with, what on the surface appear to be public APIs, but once I start looking to get access as a developer, I get walls thrown up.Often times, information about the API is public.I can browse the documentation, code samples and more, but when I want to play with the API I have to ask for access and wait for approval.This is different than a private API, where you just want to give API access to a private audience.</p>
