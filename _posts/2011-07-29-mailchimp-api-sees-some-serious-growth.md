In 3 � years a little over 144K users have accessed the [Mailchimp API][3], driving up to 10 million API calls daily.

About 3 � years ago, right before the launch Mailchimp v3.0, the powers that be decided they wanted to heavily invest in an API.

Three versions later, users that access the API have grown substantially with each version:

  * November 2007 @ v1.0 - 102 users
  * August 2008 @ v1.1 - 4,156 users
  * May 2009 @ v1.2 - 128,121 users
  * November 2010 @ v1.3 - 56,413 users

Back at the beginning of 2010 they were seeing about 3.5k users per day accessing the API, and with solid growth over the last year they are consistently seeing over 25k users per day.

In the [MailChimp Connect][5] directory, there are almost 150 listed integrations ranging from widgets, to full-on integrations with various CMS and E-Commerce platforms, to multiple SaaS partners.

The Mailchimp API is not quite in the [billionaires club][6], but it shows that some solid investment and hard work around your API can really pay off.
