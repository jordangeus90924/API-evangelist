<p>As some of you may have heard, I joined Postman as their Chief Evangelist last week. What does this mean? It means I will be telling a LOT of stories about my journey with the Postman team. Abhinav and team understand who I am and what I do, so not a whole lot will change, but like many phases of the last decade, my stories will be heavily focused on what I&rsquo;m doing with Postman. If you know my style, you know it won&rsquo;t be the usual product marketing storytelling you will find on an API service provider blog, it will be relevant stories about what I&rsquo;m doing and seeing as I do my research. Postman gets the value of me doing my research, and the importance of it remaining generic enough that you can apply outside the Postman ecosystem, but because Postman is such a versatile Swiss army knife af an API development environment (ADE), much of my storytelling will involve Postman. My goal is to always keep the stories I tell interesting, valuable, and relevant enough that people want to read them, and hopefully I do not lose my soul within the storytelling process. <br /><br />With that said, I am beyond excited to be diving into the Postman wormhole. If you&rsquo;ve followed my storytelling over the years, you know I can crank out the content when I&rsquo;m researching any topic, and when it comes to the core API lifecycle Postman is looking to dominate, I&rsquo;m confident I will be fully engaged. When I am fully engaged with a topic I care about, I can easily crank things up to OCD levels, and reach real-time levels of narration here on the blog regarding whatever I am working on within the moment. Every idea in my head gets written down, and the "best" of it gets fleshed out here on the blog, providing me with dizzying levels of momentum when it comes to moving ideas forward, refining them, and helping me better articulate myself in conversations I&rsquo;m having in person and online. When hitting my stride I can easily publish five posts a day on the blog, and craft one or two long form pieces a week on relevant topics I&rdquo;m immersed in.<br /><br />With that said, I&rsquo;d like to preemptively issue an apology for the volume of content I&rsquo;m about to produce. I&rsquo;m trusting you know how to rate limit your information intake, and you won&rsquo;t drown in my renewed excitement in the API space. Just remember that the blog here is my workbench, and I&rsquo;m hammering out my ideas in a very public way, while striving for more polished and honed work to be shared via other channels, and ultimately as part of my in-person speaking and conversations. From my experience, most people do not read my blog in a linear way via RSS anymore, and they depend on the algorithmically curated social timelines of Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and others to be expose to my work. So the five stories I publish each day do not just get eyeballs one after another in a queue, it is spread across a one to two week period, some of which will also live on an enjoy an evergreen existence as part of my search engine optimization (SEO).<br /><br />I could not think of a more relevant tool than Postman to help guide my research and storytelling. The number of stops along the API lifecycle that you can service using Postman exceeds any other API service or tools out there. No other tools I use is more developer-centric, and I&rsquo;d say developer-lead, than Postman is. I couldn&rsquo;t have found a more rich API wormhole to dive into than the Postman community. My notebook is already full of story ideas after attending POSTCON last week, and crafting a pretty robust Postman Collection of NASA APIs this weekend. So before I cranked up the music and began writing I just wanted to give you fair warning of what is about to come down the pipes, and make sure you have fair warning to turn up or down the volume, or even reach out with your own API lifecycle and Postman stories, joining me in this next portion of my API journey while I explore what is possible using Postman.</p>
