{% include JB/setup %}<p>I read a post over at Cloud Ave today by Martijn Linssen, Why API’s suck, and what they lack. Ill start by saying, everything he says about APIs, can be true for some APIs, but the post has more to do with the state of tech blogging, than anything to do with APIs.To Linssens points: First of all, API’s aren’t open - True many APIs use this term, without it being true.But those of in the industry who get it, call these public APIs and have stopped using the term open.Open has been used by a few bad marketing seeds, and perpetuated by the blogosphere.</p>
