			<p><em>01 May 2013</em></p>
			<p>I don't personally use Parse or any other backend as a service (BaaS) provider to build mobile applications. I'm just playing role as analyst when it comes to the backend as a service space, but I am a developer so I can tell when any technology provider is speaking to developers or just marketing and hock'n their wares. Each week I monitor the tech blogosphere, the API space and where it has expanded into the backend as a service space and driving mobile development. I pull 300 + feeds from random blogs and 700+ feeds from APIs providers. I see the contrast between what Techrunch, GigaOm and NextWeb produce alongside what API and BaaS providers publish to their blogs. Day after day you can really start smelling the bullshit. The positive side is that this high profile bullshit really makes good quality posts, that are actually about solving problems, stand out. I see a lot of posts come out of BaaS providers, and day after day, Parse is producing high quality posts, such as&nbsp;Versioning and Verification for your AWS Security Group Configuration and Six Creative Ways to Use Push Notification Marketing in Your Mobile App. When you read their blog, it is mostly posts that are about solving problems that developers are facing, and goes beyond just using Parse. There are a number of reasons Parse was an attractive investment for Facebook, but I think the Parse blog is a very positive signal that Parse is more than just about building a company for acquisition--Parse is building a platform that solves developers problems. Another important aspect of this, is they tell the story of how they do this in real-time. &nbsp;Without telling the story, you can be doing some amazing things and nobody will know about it--Parse gets this. Another sign of Parse's conviction, is the blog post rhythm hasn't changed since the acquisition of Facebook. I get the feeling that I will continue showcasing...[<a href="/2013/05/01/parse-is-successful-by-truly-solving-problems-for-mobile-developers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>Listening to an episode of Traffic and Weather yesterday, renewed a concept that John Sheehan(@johnsheehan), founder of Runscope made in an article he wrote for NextWeb back in March. In the post, John walks us through his &ldquo;Three Commandments for Using Someone Else&rsquo;s API&rdquo;, which, after listening to him talk about his story on Episode 8 of Traffic and Weather, I couldn't stop thinking about commandment #2: Thou Shalt Not Forego Talking to a Person An open API is a great way to test drive an integration, but it does not absolve you from the responsibility of building a relationship with the provider. If you can&rsquo;t reach someone, that should be all the reason you need not to use that API. This commandment comes out of Johns unique experience which spans: Twilio - Experience managing large, successful developer ecosystem IFTTT - Experience being consumer of not just one, but many APIs Runscope - Providing tools that make API developers lives easier This experiences is what make John&rsquo;s perspective unique. He doesn&rsquo;t just understand delivering APIs and managing developers, he knows what it is like to be a developer and consumer of APIs. Which I think makes him either just the right balance or he&rsquo;s his own worst enemy, not sure--could be both. Anyways, regarding John&rsquo;s commandment: Thou Shalt Not Forego Talking to a Person. In the past I have put a lot of pressure on API providers to consider different potential layers of their API ecosystem, and work hard to have a consistent approach to communicating, supporting and engaging with your developer ecosystem. While this all holds true, and API owners should focus on healthy developer outreach, it is a two sided coin, in which developers are accountable too. The target audience for API Evangelist is API owners, so I guess my point is that as an API owner you have to craft a healthy communication and support framework, but also explain to developers when...[<a href="/2013/04/30/api-commandment-thou-shalt-not-forego-talking-to-a-person/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>Have you taken a moment and looked at the APIs AT&amp;T is offering through their developer program lately? I think it is an interesting spread of API resources for a leading telco to offer, and is very telling about their strategy. This is one thing I like about my API monitoring platform, is that I'm forced to dive deeper into companies that are ubiquitous in the space, and make sure I'm kep in tune with where they are actually going. I thought AT&amp;T's API catalog was interesting in its current state: &nbsp; Advertising - Create a new revenue stream through the use of customized advertising. The Advertising API allows you to incorporate a simple, easy-to-use solution that supports revednue share-based monetization of your apps through the placement of paid advertising. Call Management - Pick a virtual telephone number and add real time, cross-carrier voice, and SMS communications to your app. Device Capabilities - Returns important information about a device&mdash;allowing you to customize your apps accordingly. In-app Messaging - Drive further engagement with your customers by allowing them to share information with friends and family directly from within your app. Location - Quickly and accurately pinpoint the location of an AT&amp;T mobile device. mHealth Platform - AT&amp;T mHealth Solutions for healthcare combines mobility technologies, devices, connectivity, and apps to help minimize medical costs and deliver better patient outcomes. MMS - Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) greatly enhances the power of your communications by moving beyond the text only capabilities of text based messaging. Notary Management - Add the capability to digitally sign content or data payloads to your app. Payment - Give your customers the convenience and security of having their in-app purchases charged directly to their AT&amp;T bill. SMS - Short Message Service (SMS) enables your application or service to reliably send and receive secure, targeted text messages and alerts to your AT&amp;T mobility subscribers.

			<h3><a href="/2013/04/28/api-priorities/">API Priorities</a></h3>
			<p><em>28 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>I spend a lot of time on API Evangelist getting excited about APIs.  Going on three years doing this, I'm getting a little more hardened in my view on what is "good" in the API space.  Along with that evolution, I'm getting my priorities in order.

While I may get excited about cloud computing APIs or quantified self APIs, there are other areas I think are straight up priorities--ones that we can't ignore.  To support this I'm launching several research projects into areas I have labeled as API priorities:

Federal Government
City Government
Education
Healthcare
Libraries
Universities

These represent areas I'm actively doing research in, looking for the best APIs, tools, services, building blocks and news while also generating as much analysis and white papers as I can to help define what is going on.
As with all of the API Evangelist network of research projects, everything is a work in progress and represents what I have time to dive into.  If you see anything missing, or feel some priority areas are not represented, let me know.

			<p><em>27 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>I'm always looking for easy, dead simple approaches to explaining APIs to people. Having real world examples, that folks can relate with, go along way in helping people wrap their heads around the very abstract concepts that are APIs. While going for a walk today I was thinking back when I use to build technology for my parents trucking company, when one of the fuel expenses was for Commercial Fueling Network (CFN), which is a self-service commercial fueling station. Whether your a long haul trucker or local contractor, you can use CFN to get at an essential resource for your business, whatever the application. Any business can apply and join CFN, get a "key" to access fuel resources in a self-service way. APIs are the same approach to selling any "virtual" online resource, as CFN is to selling a "physical" fuel resource. CFN doesn't just put free gas alongside the road for anyone to take. They have a portal where you know to go to get your resources, providing you with a key to access the fuel resources you need. CFN then bills you for the usage of their resource. You can be sure CFN has extensive data on how much fuel they sell and who it was sold to. With virtual resources, whether you are a iPhone developer or website developer you can use APIs to get at essential resources you will need for your business, whatever the type of applications you are developing. &nbsp;Any developer can apply to use an API, and get a "key" to access the resources in a self-service way. The best part about the online approach is you can turn ANYTHING into a resource. Your resource can be data in a database, specialized code you've developed or interact with anything in the physical world. This example works well for helping people to understand how APIs work, by using a real world example they may have experience with.

			<p><em>27 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>As the universe of APIs expands, I&rsquo;m working to find new ways that I can discover, educate myself, then organize information around the most meaningful areas in the API space. As part of this effort I&rsquo;m reorganizing API Evangelist site into a network of small story groups, so that I can focus on a specific piece of this expanding API universe. Each portion of API Evangelist will run using what I call my Hacker Storytelling format, where I use Github Page, Jekyll along with a variety of JSON driven widgets that tell a story around a specific topic. The first story group I&rsquo;m tackling is redefining two of my main sections which I had called &ldquo;service provider&rdquo; and &ldquo;tools&rdquo;. My original intent was to find resources people could use to deploy APIs, and if it was an online service I put it in service providers and if you could download and install, it went under tools. I&rsquo;m abandoning this approach and dismantling these sections and breaking them into goal oriented stories: Design Deployment Management Evangelism Monetization Discovery Consumption I don't have evangelism, monetization or consumption ready to go yet, but design, deployment, management and discovery are coming together nicely. You will be able to get at news, analysis, services and tools within these areas, as well as some overall thoughts about each area of the API universe. I'm doing this to help me focus on each aspect of the API space, allowing me to see just the news and the best of the companies who are active in that area. This approach really helps me curate and write very focused stories and white papers that serve each topic. I hope it offers similar value for you. My objective is to allow people to find information from two main areas, either using APIs or providing APIs. You can then navigate to individual areas within those two goal areas, with some overlap between them.

			<p><em>26 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>It is has been a while since I updated any of my research around APIs &amp; the Federal Government. In May 2012, I started monitoring the progress of the White House Digital Strategy, where I setup a monitoring system that pings all 246 agencies to see if they have published their digital strategy yet. As we approach the one year anniversary, I expect we'll see a lot more news emerge around what various agencies are doing as part of the original mandate by the White House. As of today there are now 23 federal agencies who have published their Digital Strategy at their domain. I have published all of my research around my APIs &amp; the Federal Government research at a permanent Github repository. I will continue pushing all my research, curated stories and analysis there in real-time. I have also published a handful of JSON data sets I have generated as part of the research: Publish List of Federal Agencies Publish List of Federal Agencies w/ Social Publish List of Federal Agencies w/ Digital Strategy Publish List of Federal Agencies w/ Digital Strategy &amp; Social You can find the JSON data for these areas, along with the PHP script I used to harvest, store and publish this data using the JSON version of each agencies Digital Strategy. While you can pull a list of federal agencies via from the&nbsp;Federal Agency Directory API, and each agencies social data using the&nbsp;Federal Social Media Registry API, the logos included with each agency is something I hand-rolled, so you won't find it anywhere other than here. &nbsp;I gave the data to the GSA, and I hope they incorporate the agency logos into the Federal Agency Directory API. My Federal Government Github project will be a permanent, living place for me to publish stories, news, data and the scripts I create around my research in the area.

			<p><em>25 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>There was a lot of buzz in the API space over the last two weeks. I'm not a big on being first with news from the world of APIs, I leave this approach to the tech blogs like Techcrunch, RWW, GigaOm, The Next Web and others. I'd rather simmer on things for a bit, think beyond the press release, and craft a post that offers value beyond the initial announcement and the churnalism. To get everyone up to speed, four major things happened in the API space over the last two weeks: Intel Buys Mashery Computer Associates Buys Layer 7 Technologies MuleSoft Acquires ProgrammableWeb 3Scale gets $4.2M in Funding There is no arguing that these are some pretty significant signs the API industry is picking up the pace, especially when you have companies like Intel and Computer Associates taking notice and making investments. I've been tracking on the space for 3 years now, with round-ups of API service providers in 2011 and 2012. For 2010, 2011 it was all an uphill battle, but in 2012 I started seeing things heat up with the introduction of several new API service providers,&nbsp;then really stepping up in November 2012 with the acquisition of Vordel by Axway. But, the last couple of weeks are pretty outstanding, with not just acquisition of two separate API service providers, but also the fact that one of them is API pioneer Mashery, being purchased by chipmaker Intel. Love or hate Mashery, they help define the space and have been at it a while a while, and we all have an industry, partly due to their work. VC Cycles More Than API Cycles Personally I feel the recent acquisitions are indeed positive signals for the industry, but I think they are also just part of the natural cycle that is set in motion by the types of businesses, companies like Mashery and Layer 7 are looking to build. These are companies that are designed...[<a href="/2013/04/25/after-last-couple-of-weeks-it039s-clear-there-is-big-opportunity-in-the-api-space/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>18 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>Intel is reportedly buying API service provider Mashery for &ldquo;a range of $120 million to $180 million&rdquo;, according to ReadWrite(Web). As I reflect on this, two main questions come to mind: Was it a smart acquisition for Intel, and worth their money? Is this a logical move for Intel since they are a chip maker? Was Intel&rsquo;s acquisition smart for Intel? If they are serious about playing in the API game, which all signals I&rsquo;ve seen say yes, I think it was smart. They didn&rsquo;t buy Mashery for their tech, although their tech was a nice add-on to Intel's existing API Gateway.&nbsp;They bought Mashery to buy their market share. Is the acquisition worth 120-180M? I&rsquo;m not sure about that. I don&rsquo;t think Masherys current market share is worth all that, so I think this is an investment in the past and the future more than current market share. Mashery is the pioneer of the API space, owning that history has value, if you can deliver on the future of the API space. Which I think Intel is more capable of than Mashery was all by itself. Next is this a logical move for Intel? They are maker of physical things like motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphic chips, embedded processors, not of things virtual like APIs. Intel is known for making the thing essential ingredients &ldquo;inside&rdquo; our PCs, laptops, servers, smart phones and digital devices. They have been the driving force of &ldquo;compute&rdquo; for the last 40 years, basically my entire life. I&rsquo;ve heard lots of chatter today that Intel moving from building the physical ingredients, to virtual APIs is too big of a switch for Intel, and they will fail. Obviously I don&rsquo;t know shit about chip manufacturing, but if Intel wants to be the leader in the next 40 years of computing, moving from central processing units (CPU) to distributed processing units (DPU) makes sense.

			<p><em>17 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>On a regular basis I review my API consumption to evaluate how I&rsquo;m using various APIs, and what I&rsquo;m paying for them. I depend on around 20 APIs to make API Evangelist work, and I need to make sure I&rsquo;m using them to their fullest potential while also being mindful of budget. As a part of my regular review, I am looking at the differences in pricing between three key services: FullContact API - I use FullContact for all my company and individual contact intelligence. I go through phases of light or heavy use depending on research projects I have going on. Full Contact provides me with per API call rates depending on the endpoint and call volume, and they limit me between four packages Trying It out (Free), Getting Started ($19/month), Gaining Traction ($99/month) and Rolling ($499/month) Alchemy API - I use Alchemy API to primarily pull text content from blog posts, so I can use it internally for indexing. With Alchemy I get access to three packages Free, Small Business ($250.00) and Basic ($800.00) AWS APIs - I use AWS for all my computer, storage, database and DNS API services. With AWS I pay by the resource, bandwidth transfer and storage and the other parts and pieces or specific actions in cloud computing. There are no packages, just modular API resources I use and get billed for. I&rsquo;m just one use case, but figured I&rsquo;d share my thoughts on how I use these three API resources within my little world. For Full Contact the jump from $19/month to $99/month isn&rsquo;t too bad. I&rsquo;ll lump all my processing together into a single month and get lots of work done. So I tend to toggle each month between these two tiers based upon my needs. For Alchemy API I operate within the free tier and stick with the rate limit of 1,000 API calls per day. If a blog post doesn&rsquo;t get pulled because I...[<a href="/2013/04/17/i-like-individually-priced-api-resources-that-flex-and-scale/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m a walking conflict most of the time. You should try being me, it can be tense about 40% of the time. I&rsquo;ll give you a couple of example of what I mean to help bring you a little closer to what I experience each day. I&rsquo;ll start with what I consider to be the 2nd most important API of all time (#1 being AWS), Twitter. I love / hate Twitter. They really deliver on everything around their API except in regards to: Rate Limits - Their rate limits suck! Competition - They don&rsquo;t approach potential competition sensibly Communication - They aren&rsquo;t good communicators Other than those three "simple areas", Twitter delivers a damn good API. I find it very hard to criticize what they do, except for the fact that having suffocating rate limits, and shutting off access for integrations you view as competitive, can well, be a pretty quick downer. An example of Twitter in action is with their recent post about Symbols entities for Tweets. I love this idea, I&rsquo;m working through thoughts that are similar, when it comes to markup APIs or what I&rsquo;m calling dictionary APIs. I think that a dictionary, symbol or other lookup functionality around an API is cool and has a lot of potential...right up until the point you realize they are have been sharecropping a lot of this innovation from the Twitter Ecosystem. In the end, I just have to live at odds with the way I feel about Twitter. I can&rsquo;t stop showcasing the cool stuff they are doing, just because I do not agree with their approach to API rate limits, communication, competition and sharecropping (or is it cropdusting?) Another similar conflict in my life is around the Pearson API. As a company I&rsquo;m not 100% in agreement with what Pearson is up to, but from an API perspective, I am a big fan of the companies approach. They follow what I consider to...[<a href="/2013/04/17/conflicting-emotions-about-api-providers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Obligatory spider web photo, because Jim and Audrey did too! The ability for me to own kinlane.com, point it at a server, host a website and a blog has been an critical part of my online world and professional career for over 12 years now. My blog goes back to June of 2007, but I have had a site and portfolio up there since around 2000. Having control over my domain has enabled me to store years of my writing, research and projects in a central location that I have control over, allowing me to land jobs, contracts or evolve into entirely new domains that have expanded my audience in ways I never imagined, like with&nbsp;API Evangelist. Anytime I can teach this approach to someone else and empower them to own their own domain, I&rsquo;ve jumped at the chance, resulting in numerous individuals who have their own thriving domains--including my girlfriend Audrey Watters with her blog Hack Education. Understanding what is necessary to purchase, own and manage your domain, servers, sites, applications and other portions of our digital lives is something everyone should do! But be careful, you just might change the world, and make a significant impact like Audrey (@audrewyatters) has. Last weekend while at MIT, I had a chance to work on a project that takes this concept of owning your domain and looks to make it an educational resource anyone can take advantage of. I ended up at the MIT Media Lab after being summoned for an&nbsp;open learning hackathon&nbsp;by MIT and Phillip Schmidt (@schmidtphi) of&nbsp;P2PU. &nbsp;During the event&nbsp;I had the pleasure of plotting and scheming with infamous technology educator Jim Groom (@jimgroom) and education rabble rouser Audrey Watters on an&nbsp;idea Jim brought with him, that was born out of the University of Mary Washington Domain of One's Own Project.

			<p>I wrote yesterday&rsquo;s piece on API education with Codecademy back in February. I didn&rsquo;t publish because I wanted to do more research on suggested areas of improvement for the Codecademy team to balance my criticism. The point of yesterday's post was not to bash Codecademy, it is to incentivize them to make their platform better. Until then, I can't really recommend as an API building block. The publishing of my post yesterday was triggered after seeing an example of what is possible after seeing another learn to code platform called Studio Sketchpad by Ari Bader-Natal (@studiosketchpad). Studio Sketchpad is an open studio platform for creating beautiful code, aiming to be a open studio for individuals learning to sketch beautiful code on the web canvas--built on a mashup of the Sketch from Processing and the Pad from EtherPad. Studio Sketchpad, while still a work in progress has many of the essential elements I feel should be part of any learn to code with API tool. Learn By Yourself - You can select lessons and learn online at your own pace Learn With Instructor - You can learn in real-time with the assistance of instructor Create Lessons - Instructors can build and record lessons and publish to a gallery, providing code walkthrough, with audio (using SoundCloud), complete with playback Cloning - You can clone a sketch (lesson) and tweek, edit and make learning more hands on Versioning - You can see the, interact and fork sketches at any point in the evolution of the script Embeddable - You can embed the sketch within your site, allowing for use on your site Render - All code renders so you can see the results of the lesson and your modifications Share - Allow you to share to your social networks Export - You can export code lessons to use outside of Studio Sketchpad Licensing - Sketches are openly licensed allowing for reuse, remix and learning I found nine additional...[<a href="/2013/04/10/some-suggested-elements-for-online-api-education-platforms/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>09 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Last week Twitter expanded its Twitter Cards initiative to allow 3rd party app developers to include links to download apps within Tweets, opening up new opportunities for app discovery via Twitter.  Yay, for app developers...
I won&rsquo;t try to explain the history of Twitter's approach to their ecosystem, their tight fisted approach to Twitter Cards, and how it affects this latest app discovery announcement.  Matthew Ingram does an amazing job (as always) of capturing the essence with Twitter plays its platform hand, and it is the one holding all the Cards.
My point is, their announcement isn&rsquo;t that exciting. Could you imagine what would be possible if Twitter decide to actually use an open standard like Open Graph, and allowed developers to innovate within Tweets using Twitter Cards?
I fully understand Twitter wants control over their platform, and I don&rsquo;t deny any platform the right to assert control.  And yes, Twitter allows their approved partners to play in this arena.  But that isn&rsquo;t open! &nbsp;And, it isn&rsquo;t part of the OG vision that Twitter was built on.
In my opinion, Twitter is missing out on soooo much opportunity for innovation in the space that exists within a Tweet.  Sure, not every developer idea would be good or even viable, but without opening it up, we will never know what is possible, and what end-users would want and embrace. &nbsp;It is all up to Twitter.&nbsp;
So much missed opportunity for innovation, in the name of control. :-(
Correction:&nbsp;I call Open Graph a Standard. &nbsp;I should have said protocol. &nbsp;I will leave as is, and just admit my error.

			<p><em>09 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>How To Get Your Grandma, Mother, Daughter and Sister to Understand APIs? You stop using gendered approaches when explaining what an API is.  I&rsquo;m not going to cite any of the past or recent examples of this (you know who you are). And I don&rsquo;t care "how you didn&rsquo;t even mean to do this", when you wrote your API example.  There really isn&rsquo;t a line between sexism and ignorant sexism.
If you really want everyone to understand what an API is, provide well written, plain english examples, that are framed around solving a problem your grandma, mother, daughter or or sister will understand--using problems they truly face in their lives.
It really is that simple.  As long as you are using gendered terms to describe what we are doing, you are raising the barrier to entry. &nbsp;And when you do this, you are talking down to a person and making them feel small, stupid and all the other power trips that go with sexism.  And yes, those thing are still there even if you "didn&rsquo;t mean to do it".
So let &lsquo;s make sure and keep API examples about solving problems and putting the valuable API resources to use, and not about gender, and get EVERYONE on board.
End of story! And if ever step over this line, call me out. I welcome it, cause I'm not perfect or exempt.

			<p><em>09 Apr 2013</em></p>
			<p>As I do with many of my stories, I&rsquo;ve been stewing on the news that online education platform Codecademy started offering API programming lessons for popular APIs like Twilio and NPR back in January. While at first glance this seems like an important evolution in API education, I wanted to really think through all the details of API on-boarding before I passed judgement. Codecademy&rsquo;s claim to fame is a pretty slick code view where you can edit your code and then a view window, which will process and run your code, letting you know if you&rsquo;ve done it right or not. Each class is broken into several lessons, allowing you to finish at your pace, with a accompanying Q&amp;A forum, glossary and scratch pad--with a badge showing you passed the course. Codecademy offers API classes for YouTube, SoundCloud, Parse, Twilio, SendGrid, NPR, Sunlight Foundation, Bitly, PlaceKitten and Stripe APIs and handful of others, with each class using Python, Ruby or JavaScript as the programming language. &nbsp; I think Codecademy is a novel idea for helping existing developers understand the ins and outs of learning a new programming language or learning an API, using their wizard driven, code tutorials. But it shouldn&rsquo;t be the only tool in your toolbox for helping people understand your API. First I don&rsquo;t think people (especially non-developers) want to &ldquo;learn a programming language&rdquo; or want to &ldquo;learn an API&rdquo;. In my opinion, APIs are about opening up access to resources that anyone can take advantage of, even non-developers. Because many APIs are built on HTTP and use simple key authentication, it makes them extremely hackable and something that anyone can put to use. I don&rsquo;t think we need to require people to be programmers to use APIs, we can allow varying grades of coders, scripters and hackers to put APIs to use to solve problems they face in their everyday worlds. When looking to educate your potential consumers about your API,...[<a href="/2013/04/09/api-education-with-codecademy/">Read More</a>]</p>

The first #APIStrat video is here!
For those of you who couldn't make it to the APIStrat in New York last February, or in case you missed some of the sessions, the videos are finally starting to come out.
The first video is from Laura Merling (@magicmerl), VP Ecosystems and Solutions at AT&amp;T, from her talk 3 Things You Need to Turn Your Enterprise Into A Platform.
All the sessions were recorded and are being edited, and they will ALL be gradually posted during the next following weeks. Publishing order will be the same as in the original program, with the only exception of the keynotes being published first.
We will be linking the videos available from our website, on the sessions page. &nbsp;You can also find all the videos and slides on InfoQ API Strategy &amp; Practice page.
Thank you InfoQ for taking care of the filming, editing and publishing.

			<p>I get a lot of inquiries from API owners about how they should price their API access in a way that will make sense to developers, but also help them generate revenue from their valuable API resources. As most of us are still trying to figure out sensible pricing for our new APIs, or better understand how to adjust and evolve pricing to better suit existing developers--Amazon is busy reducing their cloud API pricing. &nbsp; I got a simple email from Amazon today: Dear Amazon S3 Customer, We are excited to announce that we are reducing&nbsp;Amazon S3 request prices&nbsp;in all nine of our regions. We are lowering the prices for GET requests by 60% and the prices for PUT, LIST, COPY, and POST requests by 50%. For example, in the US Standard Region, we are reducing the price of every 1,000 PUT requests from $0.01 to $0.005 and the price of every 10,000 GET requests from $0.01 to $0.004. We are happy to pass along these savings to you as we continue to drive down our costs. The new lower prices for all regions can be found on the&nbsp;Amazon S3 pricing page. New prices are effective April 1st and will be applied to your bill for all requests on or after this date. Sincerely,The Amazon S3 Team These price reductions are becoming more frequent across the numerous AWS APIs I depend on like S3, EC2 and RDS. &nbsp;I have been an S3 user since 2006 and EC2 since 2008, and I didn't see price reductions at all in the early days, but they seem to be a common part of doing business in the cloud today. The obvious explanation is that competition in the cloud space is heating up, especially with Google stepping up their game, but I think there are other lessons for API owners here. That spending the time to initially develop a sensible pricing model for your API is important, but also...[<a href="/2013/04/03/moving-beyond-api-pricing-to-api-price-reduction/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been programming professionally since 1988, so I&rsquo;ve been around quite a few developers in my career. There seems to be a lot of moments lately that cause me to look back at this career, reassess what I've learned, and adjust the direction I'm going with this mined wisdom. &nbsp;This week I&rsquo;m reflecting on the recent insanity around Adria Richards, my role as the API Evangelist, and spending time thinking about the tech space's inclusiveness as I&rsquo;m hanging out with my 12 year old daughter for spring break. Throughout my career, in just about every position I&rsquo;ve taken, whether as a programmer, manager, lead, architect and VP, I&rsquo;ve encountered developers who are challenged by me, my role, skills and approach to tech. I can remember 3 separate roles I&rsquo;ve had where one of my first assigned tasks was to fire a developer who had made everyone&rsquo;s lives miserable, because before I came along they couldn&rsquo;t fire them (him), because they were dependent on them for their skills. Quality technical talent is hard to find, and many companies can&rsquo;t afford to lose the talent they already have. No matter what the personality defects or the workplace issues might be. Many developers know this and work it to their advantage, taking advantage of power they possess for their own selfish goals. This power struggle does not just exist between developers and non-developers. As a programmer I encounter developers who always have to one up you, and make you feel stupid for what you don&rsquo;t know. It might be a programming language, database platform, technical library or just the fact you use Windows vs Mac. Some programmers can co-exist, but many feel the need to challenge others, while assuming a defensive position around their established fiefdom. Outside the corporate firewall I see this behavior extended to online interactions, where programmers make non-developers feel insignificant for what they do not know, and belittle other developers for what skills they...[<a href="/2013/03/30/usually-when-developers-are-mean-it-is-about-power/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
I read your Terms of Service is one of the biggest lies on the Internet.  We agree to terms of service for each and every service we use online, without ever reading and understanding exactly what we are agreeing to.
This is one of the most damaging aspects of online life, as through this process we are giving away our rights, ownership of our data and allowing for our privacy to be compromised each and every day.  While not all services are abusing this, there are many online services that use this to their advantage, in an effort to maximize the amount of value they extract from their platform and end users.
Service providers have to go further in educating users about the terms of service they are agreeing to.  There is a great example of this in action, via an article in NextWeb called &ldquo;now THIS is how to write your startup&rsquo;s Terms of Service&rdquo;.  The post showcases how real-time sharing platform Heello has provided plain english descriptions, next to each &ldquo;legaleze&rdquo; paragraph in their terms of service.

This is nothing new. You see it with other providers like Tumblr.  But I think it is a very simple enhancement to API terms of service that can have a huge effect, and begin leading us in a more healthy direction when it comes to educating end-users about the TOS they are bound to.  While companies need the protection of a legal terms of service, there is no reason you can't provide your end users with a translated, plain english version. &nbsp;It doesn't take much work, and really sets you apart from other API service providers.
Do you know of any other examples of online services going above and beyond to help educate end users about terms of service?

Direct from The Noun Project about page: Humans have been using symbols to communicate for over 17,000 years because they are the one language everyone can understand. Symbols can transcend cultural and language barriers and deliver concise information effortlessly and instantaneously. They allow people to communicate quickly, effectively, and intuitively. And for the first time ever, this language is being combined with technology to create a social language that unites the world. The Noun Project wants our feedback on what a Noun Project API might look like and what we would use it for. &nbsp;So, I wanted to take a moment and share my thoughts, about what I would use The Noun Project API for, and some thoughts about what the endpoints might look like. Embeddable Normally an embeddable strategy for an API is in the background, relinquished to just one of the tools in the toolbox. With the Noun Project I think a healthy embeddable strategy would be front and center, providing a wide array of buttons, badges, widgets and other items users could syndicate across the web. The library of embeddable tools should be open for submission, much like the core of the Noun Project. Designers could generate custom button sets, badges and other embeddables for users to choose from. The Noun Project's embeddable strategy would make the Noun Project API accessible to everyone, even non-developers. Builders and IDE A Noun Project API would enable a next generation of mobile and web application apps, as well as other visualization and big data analysis tools to integrate consistent imagery.

When it comes to the IT decisions for API Evangelist, I carefully evaluate what services I use. &nbsp;If I begin to depend on an account, after 6 months I need to start paying a fee to secure some sort of quality of service (QOS). &nbsp;This is how I roll.
Not all platorms allow for this. &nbsp;In my opinion, all FREE platforms should have relief valves for users like me, who want to move to some sort of paid account, assuring me some sort of service level agreement (SLA) or I'll move away.
For example: Once I started using Evernote regularly, I moved to the premium level. &nbsp;I bought into Pinboard at an early rate, once I was hooked. &nbsp;Inversely, I can't pay for Twitter, Facebook and some Google services. &nbsp;Today it is about IFTT.
In light of me losing Google Reader I'm taking a hard look at all my services. &nbsp;IFTT is on the chopping block.
I have about 20-30 jobs running at IFTTT, moving data around between my cloud services, in a way I depend on. &nbsp;I need to move this into the realm of premium or paid services. &nbsp;
What are your thoughts? &nbsp;Sell me on your service.

			<p><em>26 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>I spent some time drinking IPAs and talking education technology with Audrey (@audreywatters) and a friend of ours Adam Wendt (@skinnyblimp), the COO of&nbsp;Iris Educational Media last week. IRIS Educational Media is a behavioral research and development company that provides educational resources for parents, parent educators, K-12 school staff, including teachers, administrators, paraprofessionals, and direct support employees. During our discussion, Adam was describing how he wanted to make Iris Media resources available for people to use on any platform, by providing valuable embeddable tools and resources for organizations and professionals to use on their own sites and portals. As Adam was talking, of course I&rsquo;m thinking API. An API would not just a way to drive their own line of embeddable tools, but would also allow for other 3rd party developers to build specialized tools and widgets for other platforms that Iris Media might not have awareness, time or resources to focus on. Wanting to be available on numerous platforms is easy, but actually delivering on them can be costly and time consuming--APIs are a way to share this load with a 3rd party community. An API could power Iris Media&rsquo;s syndication similar to Youtube. The Youtube API, plus a robust embeddable tool strategy is behind the massive syndication and growth of the popular video platform. Iris Media could go further with its own API, by integrating a partner layer within their API platform, and provide developers, organizations and educational professionals the ability to earn revenue by syndicating or developing widgets and applications on top of the Iris Media API. This revenue could go a long way in ensuring some of these essential educational professionals organizations stay in operation and continue making an impact. Engaging with people like Adam, who are truly making a difference in priority areas like education, is why I continue doing API Evangelist. APIs can help Iris Media be more successful in reaching its audience, but also empower the huge number...[<a href="/2013/03/26/embeddable-api-conversations-with-adam-of-iris-media/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>26 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
A roadmap is an essential part of a healthy API ecosystem.  The transparency and communication that come with providing a roadmap for your API and open data initiative will go a long way in building trust with your community.
The City of Philadelphia is sharing its roadmap of data sets that it intends to open in the coming months, by providing a release calendar using cloud project management service Trello. In addition to seeing the datasets the city intends to release, you can also see any data sets that have already been published.
According to the open data roadmap, Philadelphia is releasing data on street closures, energy consumption, evacuation routes, campaign finance, bike racks, budgets, expenditures and city employee salaries to name just a few.

This type of transparency doesn&rsquo;t just build trust with citizens and developers, it provides an incentive for the city government to deliver high quality public data, in a meaningful and timely manner.    There is still a lot of work to be done once this data is available, in order to develop quality analysis, visualizations, other APIs and tools that can be used in mobile and web applications. But what Philly is doing is a great start.
The City of Philadelphia&rsquo;s approach to its open data roadmap is good to see.  It is something all cities should have, as well as all API owners.  Your roadmap will set expectations within your community, guide your own initiatives and provide a healthy blueprint for moving your efforts forward.

			<p>
NASA has a pretty cool challenge going on, to create an API for SkyMorph, a database of optical images and catalogs generated by the Near Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) program.  According to the NASA description, SkyMorph provides:
access to imagery by time and position or searching by specific asteroid or other moving object. The time dimension, unique to SkyMorph, allows users to discover changes in the intensities of stars, e.g. supernovae, or to discover moving objects, e.g. comets
NASA is challenging us to help build a RESTful interface that would enable developers and citizen scientist to access SkyMorph imagery, lowering the barrier of access to the data and encouraging innovation around the program.
Ok, how cool is that!  APIs that enable everyone to help track on and understand objects in the sky, along with NASA.  It is projects like the SkyMorph API Challenge that keep me excited about APIs.

			<p><em>21 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>It is becoming more common for API providers to deliver documentation using what's known as interactive API documentation, instead of the usual static API documentation. Understanding how to use an API can be tough sometimes, and rather than just reading about it how it works, interactive API documentation allows you make real calls against an API, while learning about the interface. While there are several approaches to delivering interactive API documentation, my personal favorite is using Swagger. Swagger comes built in with 3Scale, which is the API management platform I use for the API Evangelist API, but Swagger is available for anyone to use as an open source project. Interactive API documentation using Swagger starts with a Swagger definition, which is a JSON representation of an API endpoint. In this case, the endpoint is for accessing my blog posts: This JSON describes everything about my very basic endpoint, which allows users to query almost 3 years of API Evangelist blog posts. Using this definition, Swagger generates the following API documentation automatically: As someone learning about the API Evangelist Analysis API, this describes the endpoint, which fields are required to make an API call, but it doesn&rsquo;t just describe this with text, it provides an interactive interface in which I can enter my API keys, provide a query value and actually make a request against the API: So I don&rsquo;t just learn about the API endpoint. I learn about what keys are needed and fields are present that allow me to request different information of the API endpoint. It allows me to actually see the request to the API, the resulting body of my API request. This type of hands on learning is essential to onboarding new users with your API. I can read your API documentation and not see the value, but when I am walked through how to build a request, and actually see the value returned in real-time, it changes the game.

All it would have taken is a humble apology from those gentleman in response to the Tweet, then some healthy discussion about why what they said was wrong, and move on kids. &nbsp;
I sure hope the hacker news crowd steps up and defends every woman that is shamed by guys now, as they seem to be a defender of this now. So if you Tweet out shaming a woman in a career changing way, know hacker news will be all over you...right? &nbsp;Right?

			<p><em>21 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>I'm tracking on a new wave of application frameworks and API centric architecture patterns, that are not just helping deliver the next wave of web &amp; mobile apps, but also bridging, aggregating and providing interoperability and transformations between APIs platforms. One company I've been watching closely is Seabourne. The Seabourne team has an approach to application development that follows a very interesting set of principles: Information Flows Instead of Pipelines - Information operates in &lsquo;flows&rsquo; where inputs and outputs are flexible and happen at any point. Flows are fluid and flexible, unlike structured, point-to-point pipelines Data has Multiple Owners - Information flows are composed of multiple streams of data owned by different partners and vendors. Any process must accommodate multiple canonical sources for different information Use APIs to Move Information - By using APIs to move information around, we decouple the data from the underlying technology and vendor, and make it possible to combine information from different technologies. APIs provide a flexible, low cost base to grow the system and meet changing needs Integrate Data Across Systems - Information lives on multiple systems inside and outside the organization. There is tremendous value to be had from combining multiple data sources together into a single information stream Translation Rather Than Standardization - Information is stored in multiple structures and formats. Any effort to manage information should focus on translating between structures rather than trying to develop a common schema I think that pretty much describes the challenges we face building web and mobile apps today, and Seabourne's approach isn&rsquo;t just about building apps, it is about organizing resources from multiple providers to build the best app you can. To see it in action you have to check out the project they just implemented using their approach called GovInfo. Using GovInfo, anyone can sign up to receive alerts from more than 100 different federal agency websites. GovInfo gets its information from a large number of sources ranging...[<a href="/2013/03/21/app-design-with-an-acquire-process-publish-api-architecture/">Read More</a>]</p>

It was inevitable.  API Evangelist now has its own API.  I had a couple partners ask for more sophisticated access than provided by RSS or JSON dumps out of my platform. &nbsp;So I launched a handful of API endpoints, allowing you to get at information from my world.
I currently have 13 endpoints providing access to the core of my platform, in 8 key areas:

APIs - Name, logo and description of the 2K APIs I'm activtely monitoring
API Stack - Access to my weekly and monthly API stacks
Analysis (Blog) - Access to my entire blog catalog
Service Providers - Access to all API service providers I track
Tools - A full catalog of all the API tools I've found
Curated News - Title and links of news that I personally curate from my 2K+ feeds
Notes - Notes I make during my daily and weekly curation
Building Blocks - The common building blocks I've identified after looking at 2K top APIs

There is a lot more data behind my firewall that I want to open up.  I do a lot of research on top APIs like Twitter and Google as well as trending areas like aggregation,&nbsp;backend, reciprocity and real-time service providers.
I will also be opening up API endpoints into the site traffic for apievangelist.com, apivoice.com and my other properties.  And toying with opening up some collections of my personal data like calendar, projects, checkins and other aspects of my world.
Currently I&rsquo;m only issuing keys to API Evangelist subscribers and partners, but let me know if you are interested in getting at any of my data.  Eventually I&rsquo;ll make much of it openly available, but I&rsquo;m still formulating my approach, and playing with different service compositions--so things will change.

			<p><em>19 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>I had a demo of a new data extraction service today called Import.io. The service allows you to harvest or scrape data from websites and then output in machine readable formats like JSON. This is very similar to Needlebase, a popular scraping tool that was acquired and then shut down by Google early in 2012. Except I&rsquo;d say Import.io represents a simpler, yet at the same time a more sophisticated approach to harvesting of web data and publishing than Needlebase. ExtractUsing Import.io you can target web pages, where the content resides that you wish to harvest, define the rows of data, label and associate them with columns in table you where the system will ultimately put your data, then extract the data complete with querying, filtering, pagination and other aspects of browsing the web you will need to get at all the data you desire. ConnectAfter defining the data that will be extracted, and how it will be store you can stop and use the data as is, or you can setup a more ongoing, real-time connection with the data you are harvesting. Using Import.io connectors you pull the data regularly, identify when it changes, merge from multiple sources and remix data as needed. Put The Data To WorkUsing Import.io you can immediately extract the data you need and get to work, or establish an ongoing connection with your sources of data and use via the Import.io web app or you can manage and access via the&nbsp;Import.io API--giving you full control over your web harvesting connections, and the resulting data. When getting to work using Import.io, you have the option to build your own connectors or explore a marketplace of existing data connectors, tailored to pull from some common sources like the Guardian or ESPN. The Import.io marketplace of connectors is a huge opportunity for data consumers as well as data scraping junkies (like me) to put their talents to use building unique and desireable...[<a href="/2013/03/19/web-harvesting-to-api-with-import-io/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
I wrote about the web to API service Import.io&nbsp;earlier today, and before I close the Evernote for this story, I wanted to highlight something else I thought they did interesting, on their pricing page. &nbsp;
I thought they provide a very honest peak into how they are pricing their services. &nbsp;First off, they admit that they are a young company, which is cool, but they also lay out some pretty interesting points around their business philosophy::

We are a free service. We will always provide a free-to-use tool
We will introduce premium features. Some of these you may have to pay for
We will always provide you with a tool to export your connectors
We will let you know if we are going to change anything that may impact your usage of import.io
We are currently in Developer Preview. Some things might not work as expected
Free accounts may be volume-limited as we move from Developer Preview to production
We will never spam you or share your details with any third parties

All of these points are something I feel ALL startups should commit to as part of their services to their users. One thing I'd also like to see from startups, is some mention of their exit strategy. &nbsp;What is the end goal? &nbsp;I think this is a relevant question for all startups, as is also good one for Import.io after the Google acquisition and shut-down of a similar service called Needlebase, back in 2012. &nbsp;&nbsp;
My goal isn't to pick on Import.io, but along with the other items they outline, I think all API startups should be openly discussing everything listed above.

			<p><em>19 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Last week Mozilla launched their new Open Badges platform, as an open standard to recognize and verify learning.  I immediately started thinking about how it could be applied to APIs for incentivizing developer participation and success.
I&rsquo;ve come across other badge programs, but Mozilla is the first open approach I&rsquo;ve seen, providing free software and an open technical standard, that any organization can use to create, issue and verify digital badges.
So I was thinking, as an API owner, you could use Open Badges to structure a series of rewards for developers who reach important milestones integrating with your API, and engaging with your ecosystem.
Some examples badge-worthy milestones might be:

Achieve X amount of API calls
Published application to showcase
Published open source code library
Developed more than one application
Revenue generated from application
Supporting the forum and conversations

It would take a bit of planning to developer the right approach to badging for each API, as goals would be different for each provider. But, providing badges could provide an incentive for developers to work towards meaningful goals you have tied to important KPIs for your API strategy, While also providing an easy way to track your most knowledgable and potentially trusted developers.

If API providers start issuing sensible and consistent badges for API knowledge it would also provide additional ways to measure the size and overall health of the API developer community.  I could envision badges that would serve specific business sectors or even around city, state and federal government APIs and civic efforts.
I will add Mozilla Open Badges to my list of API building blocks and explore other ideas about how an API provider can establish badge programs to incentivize and reward healthy API developer activity.

Google launched a Realtime API for the Google Drive Platform today.  It is the API version of the same functionality available on Google Drive, that allows for you and other collaborators to type, edit, annote and chat with each other within a Google Doc.
To use the Google Drive Realtime API you add the Google Realtime Javascript library, then you can give any local object on an HTML page realtime behavior.  The JavaScript library and Realtime API handle network communication, storage, presence, conflict resolution and sync changes using what they call a CollaborativeString object.
The Realtime API isn&rsquo;t just for documents, it can be used for productivity apps, games, entertainment and much more.  The only limitation is a developers imagination within their own applications.
Google gives a quick start, documentation and other resources to get you going, and they provide a pretty cool realtime playground for building stuff with the API in a hands-on, interactive environment.
There are other players in the realtime space already, like Firebase and Pusher.  Google&rsquo;s entry into the arena is a signal that there is developer demand for realtime tools and provides validation for the other startups.   I&rsquo;ll play with Google Drive Realtime API some more and talk with the folks at Pusher and Firebase and see what their thoughts are and how it compares.

You heard it here first. &mdash; blprnt (@blprnt) March 18, 2013 The API's ability to bridge platforms/devices/languages is almost inherently interventionist. &mdash; blprnt (@blprnt) March 18, 2013 What a fascinating thought. It is so close to how I see APIs in my minds eye. A single API design can hold so much beauty, information, expression and emotion. Imagine if you hung the API design for each iteration of the Twitter API on a wall. There is so much to interpret. It expresses the vision of Twitter founders and employees, it is in direct response to a million developers and the needs of 500 million users around the globe. &nbsp;What an impression!!! While JSON might be the only way we have to visually describe an API, each web, mobile app and data visualization could also be considered an artistic representation of the Twitter API. You could fill an entire gallery with JSON representations of each endpoint and each of its versions, applications, and visualizations. Creating interactive art exhibition of the Twitter ecosystem. I remember back in 8th grade(1984) I was in my social studies class with Ms. Schuler. She brought in some fractal prints, she said were created by her mathematician boyfriend.

			<p><em>18 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I would say the most common path to an API is from your company's database.  This makes database to API connectors, tools and services a pretty valuable area of the API space.  While there will always be high profile APIs dominating the tech blogosphere, most APIs will be launched quietly from small companies, by connecting them to various internal data sources.
During API Strategy &amp; Practice, I met a new API service provider, called SlashDB, that focuses on just delivering APIs from your database.  Once installed on any web server, SlashDB connects your internal databases and constructs a REST/HTTP web service, easily making database content accessible by URLs for getting, updating, inserting and deleting in a secure way.
SlashDB provides connectors for Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostGreSQL, IBM DB2 and Sybase--covering the top 5 databases you will find in the enterprise or small to medium businesses.
I notice that SlashDB also has Microsoft Excel connectors.  I will have to investigate this further and do another story on API deployment from Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  I know this will sound insane to the RESTafarians, but I think much of the worlds data is locked up in spreadsheets, on individual computers, throughout companies around the globe.
I've added SlashDB to my list of next generation API service providers like EmergentOne, API Spark and API Engine. &nbsp;Check it out, and let me know what you think.

			<p>This post is more rant, and about me working through my thoughts on this subject, which is why its on kinlane.com and not apievangelist.com or apivoice.com. &nbsp;This post is an aggregation of ongoing thoughts I'm having around my role in the API space, a diagram I drew the other day while enjoying an IPA, and inescapable thoughts fueled up by a post by&nbsp;Patrick Meir over at iRevolution, called Crisis Mapping, Neogeography and the Delusion of Democratization. &nbsp; Meir kicks up a bunch of thoughts related to how I perceive my role in the API space, which I believe is to help keep a certain amount of oxygen (aka open) present in the space, which I believe is the key ingredient in why the expirement we know as APIs is working. &nbsp;At first glance, API Evangelist looks like just a blog, but in reality it is a pretty complex system of data stores, API connectors, jobs and curation that I'm using to help draw a map of the API space that I can follow. Currently it looks something like this: The way I see the space, is there are a shitload of resources, awaiting to be exposed via APIs that are both public and private resources. The stewards of these resources have the ability to select from tools and resources to deploy their API resources, using various building blocks for accomplishing this. API as a ServiceAdditional to standing up your own API, there is the phenonmenon known as BaaS, PaaS and SaaS. &nbsp;Many of these platforms can actually help you deploy API resources, while also consuming and deploying resources of their own. &nbsp;For example, Kinvey allows you to deploy generic APIs from data stores you setup on their BaaS platform, bt they also consume API resources and makes available to you from eBay, and other places, while also providing you with their own API resources that you can use to rapidly deploy mobile apps.

			<p>Audrey came to me last night and said she had a project that she wanted to tackle, using the CrunchBase API. She wanted to pull a list of education startups that were founded in 2010-2012, showing their investments, CEO, founders and other related company information. A couple weeks ago, I helped Audrey download a PHP Twitter bot, reverse engineer and make it work for an objective she had around Tweeting random responses to a certain type of tweet. I figured she was ready to see what it took to hack on an API and get the research data she needed. Audrey wanted to pull a list of startups that were educated related. We started with the /search endpoint, using the query keyword &ldquo;education&rdquo;. The query parameter appears to search the title, tags and overview of each Crunchbase entry, pulling way more than what we needed, 5700 in total. Each search returned 10 startups, with a handful of fields for each company, not nearly enough information. To prove we could get what we needed, we took the first startup returned, grabbed the name and used it to perform a company /entity search, returning a wealth of information. We had what we were looking for including date founded, amount raised, CEO, founders as well as description, logos, addresses and other vital company information. Back to the /search endpoint. Each search only returned 10 results, when there were actually 5,700. I looked at the documentation and the only parameter listed, was &ldquo;query&rdquo;. No way to control how many results returned, paginate or otherwise. So I start guessing, appending page=, and max=, maxrows=, anything to get more results. Eventually I was able to change the page, so I was able to write logic to loop through each page, getting at all the results required. For each returned result from the /search endpoint, I would take the company name and perform a company search on the /entity endpoint.

			<p><em>16 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Next generation payment provider Braintree just launched a new JavaScript library that helps  merchants reduce their PCI scope in a flexible and testable way, which they are calling appropriately&nbsp;Braintree.js.  According to Braintree, the library:
...uses asymmetric encryption to prevent raw credit card data from passing through merchants' servers. It intercepts a form submit in the browser that contains sensitive data, encrypts that data with a public key provided to merchants by Braintree and then submits the form with the encrypted data to the server. Braintree retains the private key of the key pair so that merchants are unable to decrypt the encrypted fields server-side. Any string field in Braintree's API can be encrypted and encrypted values can be transparently dropped into any API call
I&rsquo;m a big supporter of what I call a healthy embeddable strategy, which includes buttons, badges, widgets and other tools you can build on top of an API or to support API integration.
With the rise in populartiy of JavaScript, and the growth of platforms like Node.js, I predict that providing your API developers with standardized JS libraries that extend the value of your API will become commonplace.
I&rsquo;m going to add a section to my embeddable building blocks, for JavaScript libraries. I&rsquo;m seeing more API providers doing cool stuff in this area.  I will try and record as much of it as I can during my industry monitoring each week and provide resources for you to follow.
I&rsquo;ve talked about the potential of markup APIs and scripting platforms&nbsp;in the past, which I think is a related example to what Braintree is doing--in which you can build JS libraries for your API users and extend not just the reach of the value generated by your APIs, but the expertise of your team.

This story comes from Phil Leggetter (@leggetter) over at Pusher.  Its about a client of theirs, cisimple, which provides continuous delivery services for mobile developers.  cisimple just released a new API, which gives mobile developers more control over the build processes for their mobile applications.
Using the cisimple API you can kick off new builds and download artifacts from your mobile dev process.  cisimple is a very interesting API resource, that I will definitely be watching, and I&rsquo;m sure I will be writing about in the near future.  But what I really think is interesting is that cisimple is allowing clients to register for real-time updates via Pusher channels, using API tokens.
This means that when you use cisimple to manage your mobile development, you now have a real-time push system that will send notifications when builds start, pass, fail, etc.  This opens up a whole world of human integration with the build process via desktop and mobile notifications, but also can be used in other systems that play a role in your dev cycles.
The weaving of a Pusher real-time notification layer into the cisimple API is pretty innovative. Something I&rsquo;m sure will deliver huge value to their customers.   But think of the potential as a standard approach for all API owners?  You could offer developers real-time notifications about their own usage of your API, providing them with an intimate view of how their application(s) are using an API.  Addiitionally it seems like you could set up a pretty interesting system wide notification layer that would let you, as the API owner, establish notification channels regarding overall API usage, thresholds and other important signals from your platform.
As I continue to dive into the world of real-time APIs, I&rsquo;m surprised at the multiple ways in which we can truly deliver real-time value using APIs.  cisimple API + Pusher is in interesting addition.

			<p>Maciej Ceglowskiis, the founder of popular social bookmarking platform Pinboard,made an interesting proposal over on the Pinboard Google Group: I've been thinking about imposing an API tax, the proceeds of which would go into improving API infrastructure and offsetting operating costs, structured along these lines: API free to use for your own Pinboard account Every API client making requests on behalf of someone else must register an app identifier $20/year tax if your app makes requests for over 100 Pinboard accounts $100/year tax if your app makes requests for over 1000 Pinboard accounts Possibly additional price levels to waive certain rate limits Think of it as a road tax that then pays for further construction, repair, and people in orange vests. I&rsquo;m guessing that Maciej has a lot of experience to back his proposal, watching how developers use Pinboard for their own purposes, or on behalf of a user via a client. I heavily depend on Pinboard for my curation at API Evangelist, so API access would remain free for me. I&rsquo;m not sure how I would feel if I was building a client. On the forum, there is very interesting feedback from Matt Schmidt, developer of PinDroid, the leading Pinboard client for Android: I'm very much against this. Why would you tax the makers of the apps that help drive use of your product, rather than the users themselves? To extend your road use tax analogy, this is like taxing the car companies for their customer's use of the roads. I offer PinDroid as a free, open source app and have no interest in making money off it, but I also have no interest in losing money on it. Why not offer api access as a premium account feature (like archiving) for an extra buck instead? To be clear, if such a "tax" were to be implemented, I will have to stop developing and supporting PinDroid and take it off the market.

			<p><em>15 Mar 2013</em></p>

In May 2011 I released a book called the Business of APIs. The book was intended to be an introductory walkthrough for non-technical people, to the world of APIs. I wanted to educate business, organizational and governmental leaders about the space, and the important role of APIs in having a healthy digital strategy.
Its coming up on two years later, and I'm finally getting around to updating the Business of APIs. After a nice long walk on the strand with @audreywatters, we have the outline for the next version:

What is an API?
What are APIs used for?
The history of APIs
What goes into an API?
Do you need an API?
How do you get an API??
What are the common building blocks of an API?
What are possible business models for an API?
How do you evangelize and support an API?
Where have some APIs stumbled?
APIs, a new way of doing business

The goal of the Business of APIs is the same. Help anyone, from any company, organization or the government understand what an API is, and why they are important. &nbsp;You don't have to be a developer to put APIs to use, this book is for everyone.
Look for an updated version of the Business of APIs by June. I'll still keep it a simple guide to the space, but provide a whole lot more information that will help you understand the Business of APIs.

I ended up at the Punfork API today for some reason. Full disclosure: "Punchfork has been acquired by Pinterest! Read the announcement. Site shutdown: March 31st, 2013".  Just getting that out of the way. While at the site, I ended up at the Goodies page, which I think represents a nice set of basic embeddable tools for an API.
First using Punchfork Badges, you can customize a badge, then copy and paste the embed code onto your blog's sidebar, or anywhere else you want it to appear:

Then you can download a Punchfork logo (ok, its just one, but it gets point across):

Last, you can enter your address and request a Punchfork sticker to be sent to you:

These are all three, simple examples of a good approach to providing embeddable tools for users.  Badges are pretty straightforward, and it is sensible to provide logos and other images as part of a healthy branding strategy.  But the request for a sticker is something I haven't added to my listing of embeddable building blocks. After thinking about it, stickers are the OG embeddable tool.  Something your users can take offline, and embed anywhere.
At some point I will do a roundup of all the embeddable building blocks, since I've been adding some new ones like sticker request form.

I see a lot of new API platforms emerge, and often times you see them deploying their own solutions to problems that are actively solved by top API platforms, and are already adopted by common mobile and web app users.
The best example of this is with authentication.  Its growing more and more common that you don&rsquo;t build your own login, you use Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google or Github oAuth.
It seems to me that when it comes to other common resources, the same could be applied.  So I&rsquo;m exploring what my essential stack of API driven resources might look like:
Messages



















Photos












Documents








Videos











Notes







Bookmarks








Blog











Contacts











Checkins








Audio







Calendar







Payments












Advertising















URL Shortener







I could do quite a bit with this assembled as a single backend stack, if it included a regular datastore, key-value store, user management and other essentials for building apps.
It seems to me that new platforms shouldn&rsquo;t always create new silos, but bridge the existing ones that we depend on already.

			<p>
Node.js, the server-side software system designed for writing scalable Internet applications in JavaScript, seems to be getting more attention lately from top API providers because of its event-driven, asynchronous I/O that can minimizeoverhead and maximize scalability.
Last week Google released an official Node.js client library for accessing Google APIs that supports authorization and authentication using OAuth 2.0.  Then earlier this week, Amazon Web Services announced that AWS Elastic Beanstalk, their PaaS solution now supports Node.js applications.
While Google&rsquo;s deployment is a client, and AWS&rsquo;s is an application platform, they both have the same objective--enabling developers to build highly reliable, scalable, and cost-effective applications using APIs.
Both Google and AWS recognize the potential for selling developers their valuable API driven resources, by providing them with Node.js solutions.  JavaScript is the number one language on Github, with Node dominating most starred and most forked overall categories, according to Github trends.
I think that AWS and Github both send a good signal to other API owners, that they need to step up the availablity of Node.js resources for their API developer communities.

			<p>One of the best aspects of being the API Evangelist, is I get to hang out with smart folks, doing gaming changing things across all business sectors. Last week I was able to make it to the API Social, an event held in Berkeley by a group of API savvy faculty members. This is my third one, and the group is up to some very interesting things. I had a conversation with one UC Berkeley analyst about a problem that isn&rsquo;t just unique to a university, but they are working on an innovative solution for. The problem: UCB Developers are creating Web Services that provide access to sensitive data (e.g. grades, transcripts, current enrollments) but only trusted applications are typically allowed to access these Web Services to prevent misuse of the sensitive data. Expanding access to these services, while preserving the confidentiality of the data, could provide student and third party developers with opportunities to create new applications that provide UCB students with enhanced services. The solution: Wrapping untrusted applications in a "Proxied Facade Service" framework that passes anonymous tickets through the &ldquo;untrusted&rdquo; application to underlying services that can independently extract the necessary personal information provides a secure way of allowing an application to retrieve a Web User&rsquo;s Business data (e.g. their current course enrollments) WITHOUT exposing any identifying information about the user to the untrusted application. I find their problem and solution fascinating, I also think it is something that could have huge potential. When data leaves any school, healthcare provider, financial services or government office, the presence of sensitive data is always a concern. More data will be leaving these trusted systems, for use in not just apps, but also for analysis and visualizations, and the need to scrub personally identifiable information will only grow. I&rsquo;m still processing everything the team at UC Berkeley is doing, but want to write about as I&rsquo;m wrapping my head around it.

			<p>
It looks like the HTML5 document embedding platform Crocodoc is starting to plan the next version of their API.  The are being very transparent about the process (which I like), and putting out the word looking for some new team members to help them get the job one.
Over the next couple weeks they want build an API that is simple and easy to use, but also capable of handling tens of millions of document conversations a month.  To help get the job done they are looking for:

Sales Engineers - Boots on the ground to let them know what people want and to help us engage the developer community
JavaScript Engineers - Help them open source the demos we build and design our client-side libraries
DevOps Engineers - Help them build the infrastructure we use to convert millions of documents each month

I found the Crocodoc posting on Hacker News, but I&rsquo;m writing about because I appreciate API owner sending out signals that they are planning the next version of their API.  This type of transparancy is not just important in helping you find talent to make it happen, it sends a signal to the community that you are beginning a planning cycle and can encourage community feedback and involvement. &nbsp;&nbsp;
The Crocodoc API reworking sounds like a pretty innovative project to work on, and the Crocodoc team looks like a pretty smart team to get a chance to work with.

			<p><em>12 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>Netflix has entered the final stages of shuttering its public API last week. Its been coming for a while now, starting in June of 2012, and now is official with the platform no longer accepting new API registrations. After reading about the changes to the Netflix Public API program on their blog, and hearing much of the news in response, everyone seems to file this away, along with the Twitter API--just another API platform screwing over its developers. As I do, I wanted to take a step back, look at the bigger picture and try understand what happened. &nbsp;On October 1st 2008, Netflix launched their public API, and they appear to have done everything right. They had a blog, solicited code samples from developers, accepted application submissions and even showcased the developers apps in the gallery. Netflix would even help promote your app to Netflix subscribers and threw hackathons. The Netflix API team worked to improve API performance, communicate regularly, but really nothing that amazing happened. There were applications like InstaWatcher and WhichFlicks&nbsp;(among others)&nbsp;developed on the API, but as Daniel Jacobson puts it, a thousand flowers didn&rsquo;t bloom. In these situations its easy to blame the API provider, but developers didn&rsquo;t really step up and build anything that innovative and cool. So is this a failure of Netflix? A failure of developers to innovate? Or could it possibly be a third: failure of the API vision? I would say the demise of the Netflix public API is equal part Netflix and the developer, and just the nature of the industry it exists in. It didn&rsquo;t take me long to look through the Netflix API blog, so I can tell they didn&rsquo;t put alot into evangelizing the API. But I really can&rsquo;t find any innovation that occurred by developers as part of it, so I think us devs have to share some of the responsibility as well.

When it came to API focused events, the only conference there was to attend was the Business of APIs Conference, from Mashery.  They have been putting on the conference(correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong) since 2007.  There wasn&rsquo;t much of an "API Industry" back then, and Mashery was definitely the pioneer in the space, getting the word out and along with ProgrammableWeb, has done a lot to define the API space.
Fast forward five years, and after the successful API Strategy &amp; Practice in February (originally scheduled for November), there are now five API event series going on:



















It is exciting to see the explosion of events, and I&rsquo;m hopeful regarding how much progress will occur in 2013 with this many conversations going on.  It is also promising to see the international growth, with Nordic APIs happening in Scandinavia, API Days coming from France, Business of APIs in London and API Summit spreading the conversation from United States and Australia.
With this amount of buzz, APIs will definitely continue its spread to the mainstream.  My only hope is that all the events make sure and represent the space well by being interoperable and sharing content, speakers and ideas openly so that the entire industry benefits.

			<h3><a href="/2013/03/10/soa-vs-api-the-humans-win/">SOA vs API - The Humans Win</a></h3>
			<p><em>10 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>As the API movement marches forward, it continues to grind against the enterprise and its legacy of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), which increases the frequency at which people ask me, What is the difference between API and SOA? This is not a technical explanation of the differences, but a philosophical one that many will argue does not apply, but in my opinion is the dark matter around the technological and business approach of SOA, that makes API work. Many say that a web API is just one component in an SOA toolbox. This is true. Using HTTP for an API is not that novel in itself. That is until it jumped out of the enterprise petri dish, got a little oxygen to grow, allowing the introduction of some new aspects that the industry and technology overlords of SOA would never have introduced on their own. While reading the Nation Building in the Age of APIs, by Matt McLarty (@MattMcLartyBC) of Layer7 today, he reminded me that: "Every paradigm shift in technology has been driven by both innovation&mdash;the new technology itself&mdash;and application&mdash;how that technology can be used. In other words, there is a machine side and a people side to every technology change. The technologists responsible for implementing these changes often bias towards their comfort zone&mdash;the machine side&mdash;and overlook the people side." He is right. &nbsp;APIs moves us closer to the people side of the equation, outside the technologists comfort zone, but I would also add that it moves it outside the business and industry leaderships comfort zone, introducing more balance that has the potential to make online communities, platforms and ecosystem thrive. Matt continues to say: "Ultimately, the success of a company&rsquo;s API will depend on the creation of a diverse community for that API&mdash;end users, partners, developers, and more&mdash;as well as the adoption of a business model that allows the API to contribute to the company&rsquo;s bottom line." SOA does a damn fine job...[<a href="/2013/03/10/soa-vs-api-the-humans-win/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
As the API Evangelist, I&rsquo;ve made it my mission to go outside of the Silicon Valley bubble and educate the &ldquo;normals&rdquo; about the potential of APIs.  In doing this I have conversations with a wide range of folks from new startups, to the GSA in Washington DC.  One growing trend I&rsquo;m seeing is the number of VC and angel investors reaching out, to have me help them understand the API space and how it applies to their investments.
I have a couple VC&rsquo;s I talk to on a regular basis, but I have a growing number of new ones who are investing more and more in technology companies and need to get a grip on this API world.  As a Terry Kearns from Oxford Strategic Advisors, LLC,&nbsp;put it yesterday:
"I wanna let you know I appreciate all the work you've done here. For a guy who is not a tech guy. You really help me out with a lot, your articles and information help me get my arms around this whole API world"
That is my mission.  This is what I do.  Nobody pays me to educate people like this about the APIs space, but it is so critical that the folks who are investing in the next generation of healthcare, education, manufacturing and other business sectors, understand APIs, at least at a basic level.
APIs are part of fundamental change in how we conduct business, not just in technology sector, but EVERY aspect of our government, business and even our personal lives.  Let me know how I can answer questions about your existing investment portfolio or regarding business sectors you are looking to invest in.
Make sure your companies truly understand APIs, and you are making educated investments.

			<p><em>07 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Are you ready for more discussions about APIs?  I know I am. :) This time its from our Scandinavian friends, with four events in 2013.  Nordic APIs is a series of conferences and events held across Scandinavia which provides knowledge and information about APIs.
API Evangelist is a supporter of Nordic APIs, and you will find me speaking at the 2 day event in Stockholm in September.  I will be speaking with Adam DuVander(@adamd) and John Musser(@johnusser) of ProgrammableWeb, Jacob Ideskog (@jacobideskog) and Travis Spencer (@travisspencer) of Twobo Technologies, as well as the notorious Andreas Krohn (@andreaskrohn).
I feel an awakening happening around APIs, and its not just a Silicon Valley thing.  People around the globe are becoming more aware of the potential of APIs.  I'm getting more and more requests from Europe and South America for API education, resources and tools.
We need to support as many of these open, vendor neutral conversations about APIs as we can.  The Nordic APIs series is looking for sponsors and support.  If your company is looking to break into Scandinavia, you should be supporting Nordic APIs, because its guaraneed to be a couple hundred of the smartest folks across the Scandanavian API space assembled in one building.
Head over to Nordic APIs site and contact them directly to see how you can support the conversations that will be occurring across Scandavia, and I look forward to seeing you there.

			<p><em>06 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m working through lists of APIs and API service providers who I&rsquo;ve rated pretty highly because of their work in the past, but red flags have gone up because I&rsquo;ve haven&rsquo;t seen a blog post, tweet or commit from them lately. One of the service providers I&rsquo;m reviewing is Zypr, which providers voice enabled architecture built on popular APIs. Zypr fits in with my vision of where APIs are going, because Zypr is doing the same thing as aggregation, automation and other trending service providers, but the end goal is this use case is voice. In Zyprs own words: Zypr aggregates proprietary 3rd party APIs, categorizes their functions, and then presents those functions through a single, normalized API. By aggregating and normalizing 3rd party APIs, Zypr creates a stable access point for devices and apps to access those services without concern for service and API changes. That sounds exactly like what Singly is doing, but with voice as the vehicle for making valuable API resources avilable on apps running via mobile phones, tablets and in our cars and homes. I really like the Zypr graphic. I will have to create a similar version to articulate some the API trends I&rsquo;m seeing. I hope Zypr is just heads down, working hard on their platform. According to my API stack rank, there aren&rsquo;t very many positive signals coming out of the platform: Last Blog Post - 09/28/2012 Last Tweet - 01/30/2013 Last Commit - 10 months ago What Zypr is doing is important--I hope they have enough runway to make happen. &nbsp;If they need to cut corners, they shouldn't replicate the service or client adapter portion of their platform, they could just partner with an existing API aggregators&nbsp;like Singly for these layers, as well as reciprocity providers like Elastic.io or Foxweave to migrate and tranform data. &nbsp;In my opinion Zypr should focus on how their engine works, and partner and generate open source to build the rest....[<a href="/2013/03/06/api-driven-voice-architecture/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>05 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
It was interesting to see Amazon step up in the advertising game with the beta release of the Amazon Mobile Ads API this week.  I wouldn&rsquo;t want Amazon getting into my space, when it comes to any API resource, especially advertising.  On the other hand, one can say that the space needs disruption with the dominance of Google with their multiple offerings:


Google Mobile
Google Adwords
DoubleClick
DoubleClick Ad Exchange
AdMob
Adwords
Youtube

I think we can expect some intense competition when it comes to advertising and specifically around mobile advertising APIs--battling for your eyeballs on smart phones and tablets in 2013.
Another layer that will add to the competititiveness with advertising APIs is the fact that all three social media and networking giants have their own advertising APIs now as well:


Facebook
Twitter
LinkedIn

With Google and Amazon both having devices in the game (Android and Kindle), it will be interesting how they partner with Facebook, Twitter or Linkedin for the social layer, and where all of this leaves Apple.
Let&rsquo;s not forget about the  me too category with Bing Advertising APIs and Yahoo Advertising Central, or the potentially over 100 other advertising APIs available via ProgrammableWeb.
Any way you look at it, 2013 will prove to be a very competitive landscape when it comes to web and mobile advertising, with so many heavyweight contenders with their own devices and API driven advertising platforms.  I think an advertising API roundup is in order, in the near future.
I just hope that we start thinking beyond advertising when it comes to APIs and the monetization of web and mobile apps in 2013.

			<p><em>05 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m a little behind in working through my list of new APIs to review.  So I&rsquo;m spending about 3 hours each day going through my list of new APIs accumulated from ProgrammableWeb, Tweets, Bookmarks, Google Alerts and other ways I have for discovering new APIs.
After looking&nbsp;through a couple hundred APIs, I&nbsp;wanted to share some things that stand out, and make me feel someone really doesn't give a shit when they hit publish on their API:

Your entire developer area is a PDF
Really long, incoherent URL for dev area
Dev area is just a page in your help directory
You put google ads on every page of your API documentation
No communication, support or contact information at all
Sign up form that pops up in my face as soon as page loads
Require an NDA before I register

These are just a handful of things that make me give an API a C or D grade, which means you probably aren&rsquo;t on my radar. &nbsp;But then again if you don't have active blog or twitter or developers aren't talking about you, your API won't register on the radar even with a B grade.
With tools like 3Scale, APIHub and Mashape out there, it isn&rsquo;t hard to hang your API in a professional way, with minimal amount of effort and resources.
After looking through hundreds of APIs I leave with the same feeling:  that there tons of good ideas out there, but 80% of them are just executed very poorly.

			<p><em>05 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m looking at new and innovative ways companies are building analytics and visualizations on top of APIs, and one of the new tools I&rsquo;ve come across is ImpactStory.  ImpactStory aggregates altmetrics:  diverse impacts from your articles, datasets, blog posts, and more.  But this post isn&rsquo;t about ImpactStory, I&rsquo;ll crunch what they do and write about in another post.

This post is about their usage of feedback, helpdesk, and knowledge base management tool&nbsp;UserVoice, which is a service I always recommend to API owners looking to support different aspects of their API community.
ImpactStory simply has a &ldquo;BETA - Send us Your Feedback&rdquo; image in the top right corner of their site.  When you click on the logo, you are presented with a simple UserVoice form for submitting your ideas of where you think ImpactStory should take their platform.

I think this is a pretty dead simple way of soliciting feedback from your community. Involving your users in your roadmap planning can go a long way in building goodwill with them, and encouraging participation and innovation in other ways.
After I spend more time playing with ImpactStory, I&rsquo;ll do another post on what else they are up to, but at first glance its a pretty interesting approach to developing tracking analytics, visualization and other embeddable goodness using APIs.

			<p><em>04 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve been following the great coverage by Paul MIller over at Cloud Ave about whether Infochimps running from the Data Market business, and Discussing Data Markets in New York City. He&rsquo;s touched on any interesting topic around the viability of data markets as a business, and the fate of several of the most high profile players in the space. In 2011, when it comes to data API marketplaces and providers I tended to showcase players like Factual, Kasabi, DataMarket and InfoChimps. In 2013, we&rsquo;ve watched Kasabi disappear, and the migration of InfoChimps from an open data market, to a enterprise data platform. While Factual and Datamarket appear to be going strong. I think this reflects a common, lack of imagination by Silicon Valley because they are so focused on making money, they miss the need to support critical aspects of industries, that are required to allow for the growth they want to see. While I feel there is money to be made off data marketplaces, however right now I think it is critical that we invest in people standing up and exposing data, not just focusing on making money off this process at levels that VC&rsquo;s deem adequate. I make the same argument with API providers, its not that there isn&rsquo;t money in standing up APIs, but we need to heavily invest in the education of potential API owners and the healthy standing up of APIs. &nbsp; There will be plenty of money down the road from APIs and data marketplaces, but by always looking at it through a Silicon Valley perspective, we are going to stifle the oxygen necessary for a truly healthy, vibrant space. I&rsquo;m spending time looking through the API service provider space, and last week I noticed the big gap in there being API deployment services vs. API management services. This imbalance is due to a gold rush by heavily VC funded API service providers looking to capitalize on the enterprise...[<a href="/2013/03/04/short-sighted-silicon-valley-limits-potential-of-data-markets/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>API driven analytics and visualizations is one of the new areas&nbsp;of API usage I'm tracking on. There are many &ldquo;big data&rdquo; platforms emerging these days, but I&rsquo;m looking for dead simple tools and services anyone can use to generate analytics and visualizations via APIs. Think of reciprocity providers like IFTT, Zapier and Elastic.io. These new API driven service providers, make it easy to migrate data between cloud services, using a simple set of source API, triggers, actions and target APIs--with a dead simple icon and wizard based UI, allowing any user to put the platform to work. I want this approach for embeddable analytics, visualizations and other widgets that are easily generated via APIs. Last week I came across a new platform called Ducksboard, which allows you to easily generate some pretty sophisticated analytical widgets from common API sources. The platform even comes with a marketplace where you can find other widgets. The only problem is that Duckboards is meant to generate dashboards, and not really open and portable widgets. &nbsp;We'll keep an eye on this platform, see where it goes. Then last night I came across Keen IO, an analytics Backend as a Service (BaaS) platform that lets developers build analytics features directly into their apps, from common API services. Keen IO provides a pretty sophisticated workbench for building embeddable charts, metrics and other analytics or visualizations that you can render anywhere, using iOS, Android, JavaScript, Ruby, Python and Java libraries they provide. At first glance, this space can feel just like earlier waves of widget building platforms of the Web 1.0 &amp; 2.0 worlds. But I think we hadn&rsquo;t reached critical mass, in the number of available API resources, as well as an awareness of APIs in general, in order to realize the true potential of widgets. I think we are getting closer in 2013. I&rsquo;m optistic that a new breed of API driven analytics and visualization tools will emerge making dead simple,...[<a href="/2013/03/04/next-generation-of-api-driven-analytics-and-visualizations/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Hands on, interactive tools are proving to be the most useful way to learn about an API--empowering users to see it in action, and witness the value it delivers.  Many companies are doing this by providing API explorers, consoles, interactive documentation and other hands-on tools that allow you to see how any API actually functions and learn about the API in realtime.
One of the latest companies to do this is MMS API provider Mogreet, which has stepped into the API explorer game with their own API tester allowing anyone to visually build an API call that sends multimedia messages, as well as take advantage of the 25 other methods available via the API platform.

The API tester is available for all users via the developer dashboard, providing a hands on way to learn about the Mogreet API, all available endpoints, understand which parameters are required or optional, experiment with alternatives and quickly make the calls and see the result, understanding the value and operations before you get to work coding around the API.
While I think using an API explorer like Apigee&rsquo;s can provide value, but I also recommend rolling your own toolkits that might speak specifically to your target audience.  I think a standard API console or explorer can help developers understand the operations of an API, but I think the right GUI tool can help any user understand the potential your API offers.  Which might make the difference between an integration project getting funded or not, with decision makers properly understanding how your API can be put to use.
Nice work Mogreet team!

			<p><em>04 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>How to structure pricing for an API is one of the top 5 questions I get from people who are currently planning their API strategy. In my opinion, there is, and never will be a one size fits all API pricing strategy. What you charge for your API resources should reflect their value and how they are accessed and used by your target consumers. The Backend as a Service (BaaS) space is working hard to differentiate themselves in 2013 with different approaches to pricing of mobile backend resources. Amazon is still shaking up the API space with new services, pricing models and the price reduction of API resources at a dizzying pace. I had the pleasure of meeting the Apicultur team while in Paris for API Days&nbsp;last October. Apicultur is a linguistics API platform, that is pushing the boundaries of what is an API platform as well as how you price language API resources. Apicultur recently shared some of the thinking behind the current version of their platform pricing&nbsp;where they&nbsp;structure the price depending on three factors: Complexity of the API - Some APIs perform a very simple task (like removing commas from a text) while others deal with more complex task (like extracting if the opinion expressed in a particular text is positive or negative)--the "bigger" the API, the pricier it gets Speed - The max speed by default is one call per second. In order to get more calls per second, Apicultur ask for a prepayment that is discounted from the final price at the end of the month (i.e., is not an extra price, is just a prepayment as a commitment). In addition, there's a discount at the end of the month for users for those who get a speed limit feature Support -&nbsp;The basic support offered is the community support. For more support, special fees are offered Apicultur feels that by keeping the everything priced at 10,000 API calls, keeps things easy...[<a href="/2013/03/04/api-pricing-on-complexity-speed-and-support-at-apicultur/">Read More</a>]</p>

I stumbled across the Twitter Counter API in my monitoring for the API Stack this morning.  The Twitter Counter API allows you to retrieve key metrics on any Twitter account like username, url and avatar. &nbsp;All data you can get via the Twitter API, but with Twitter Counter API you get additional information like account growth statistics and ranking, that Twitter doesn't provide at all.
I find it fascinating that someone can build an API to augment an existing API, which is why I keep talking about it, I guess :) We are seeing a more standardized version of this with API aggregation providers like Singly and Adigami, where they not only aggregate APIs from a variety of sources, they also build entirely new APIs based the added value that is created after they are brought together.
Thinking about if further, it would be cool if you could submit your API to be listed in your parent API providers API area.   Think of APIhub and Mashape, but every API area would have its own 3rd API marketplace.  API providers often allow 3rd party developers to submit code libraries and samples to be listed as resources, as well as applications for listing in an application showcase. So it makes sense to potetially allow for your developers to submit APIs for validation and publishing into a designated area.
It seems to me that we shouldn&rsquo;t exist as islands, we should be able to invite in other API resources built on top of our APIs, or that compliment our APIs.  We should also have terms of use and pricing models that invite others to take our API resources and deploy in other ecosystem, building the next wave of BaaS providers that will be delivering specialized stacks of resources for developers to efficiently build mobile and web apps.

			<p><em>02 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>I feel we have done a good job explaining what is an API, why people need APIs, and providing services to manage APIs, but we are falling short on delivering information, tools and services for deploying APIs. First I want to acknowledge that many companies have established IT resources, in the form of technology talent, and internal systems they can put to use when deploying APIs. This post isn&rsquo;t for you. This is about individual problem owners looking to deploy APIs, who most likely have little or no access to traditional IT resources for a variety of reasons. You want to deploy an API, because you havplease some data, content or other resources you need to make accessible to partners or the public, allowing for integration into other systems or be used in the development of web or mobile applications or possibly even data analysis and visualizations. Machine Readable As much as I love APIs, I suggest everyone consider your overall objective behind launching an API. You may not need an API, you may just need to make your information machine readable and available on the open Internet. Technically, this isn&rsquo;t an API, but publishing your data or content in a machine readable format like XML or JSON can accomplish many of the same goals of an API, without the overhead of an API. Many tools you use every day like Microsoft Office, Google Apps, Salesforce provide tools for publishing data and content in machine readable formats like CSV, XML or JSON, much like publishing or printing as a PDF. Not everyone needs an API, but everyone needs to understand the how-to, and the benefits of making machine readable a default in all business, organization, government and even individual processes. PDF made data and content portable, for humans. But a PDF does very little good for other machines, websites and mobile apps.

			<p><em>01 Mar 2013</em></p>
			<p>There are numerous companies, with existing IT infrastructure, who are looking to deploy APIs in 2013. These companies will be deploying APIs using their existing technology teams, or depending on one of the 17 API management service providers available. This market is ripe for the 3Scale's of the world to provide valuable services to, but for many companies, organizations and government agencies who need to deploy APIs this year, API deployment will be about taking an existing database or multiple databases, and open them up to the public, partners, 3rd party developers or possibly just provide access to a remote department or branch of their company in the easiest way possible. Not all companies will have the resources, or the need to deploy full blown API programs. &nbsp;They just need a dead simple database to API solution that will quickly expose their data over the web in a secure way. Until recently this solution wasn&rsquo;t available in the cloud, but a new API service provider called Emergent One has stepped up to fill in the gap. Emergent One is a cloud service that allows you to connect to your company's MySQL, PostgreSQL or Amazon RDS databases, then generate a REST API from your existing data stores. Using Emergent One you can define a new API, connect to your database using an agent or direct connection, then define your API resources complete with meta data, sub-resources, in-line resources, fields and computed fields. Pretty much all you will need to make a clean web API from a database. Once you have your API resources defined, Emergent One provides you with a developer portal around these APIs, and the ability to provide developer registration, then issue keys they can use to access your data--providing the openness you desire, while keeping things secure and within your control. The developer portal is complete with documentation, explorer console and code libraries for iOS, Android and in Ruby.

			<p>Photo Credit: AVnet I try to keep API Evangelist a place where API newbies and API experts can both find what they are looking for. To meet this demand I&rsquo;m constantly moving the site around, trying to uncover more information, in a logical way that speaks to everyone. To change things up a little I moved a couple of the most important trends in APIs out of the trends section, and put them on the right hand menu, making them accessible from any page. There are four trends I think are important to how APIs are being used right now: Aggregation - Merging various APIs together into not just meaningful new stacks of resources, but entirely new resources, as a result of merging BaaS - The promise of Backend as a Service is to bundle together resources developers need to build mobile apps more efficiently. &nbsp;Some providers are rolling their own stacks, while others are using a hybrid approach with wise use of 3rd party API resources Reciprocity - The integration, interoperability, automation and transformation of data between cloud services, in a way that respects the relationshiop between user and platform, that uses APIs. Realtime - A realtime flow of data and resources using APIs and web technologies, meeting the demand of the API economy. I feel these areas will represent a shift in how APIs are deployed and consumed to meet the growing demand for the data and resources driving web and mobile applications. While the API should exist on its own, these areas represent an evolution in how APIs are bundled together into more meaningful stacks, new mashups of resources and providing the integration, interoperability, automation and real-time needs of businesses in the API economy. In addition to these four trends, I&rsquo;m looking at several other ways APIs are being used in new and potentially powerful ways: Voice - With the ubiquitous nature of mobile devices, voice is the next generation of discovering...[<a href="/2013/03/01/api-trends-i-am-watching/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>APIs are all the rage, anyone should be able launch an API from CSV, Microsoft Excel, Google Spreadsheet or the common databases such as MySQL, PostGres, Amazon RDS, Microsoft SQL Server. Right? I&rsquo;ve been watching API service providers evolve for the last three years, helping companies be successful in managing their APIs. But when you actually going through the list of service providers, looking for someone to help you deploy an API, there are very few options out of the box. The list of API Players coming from the enterprise: These enterprise players assume you will have existing infrastructure to publish web services, files and other message systems that they can connect with, to deploy your new APIs that you will manage. The most recent generation of API service providers: Are pretty much the same. While they may provide how to guides for deploying APIs on AWS, like 3Scale, the deployment of API endpoint is still your responsiblity. You need to have existing infrastructure that will do it, or find the REST framework of your choice--both requiring you have the appropriate talent and resources. Next up you can, deploy one of the open source API solutions, to proxy and manage your APIs: But again, you need the resources and know how to implement, and they are generally management tools, so you still need to &ldquo;launch&rdquo; your own API endpoint. When you start looking at the next generation of API service providers like Apiary.io, you can really maximize the design, planning, documentation and deployment cycle, but you still need to code up your actual API. After Apiary.io we start to get to the service providers who can deliver on my vision of APIs for the masses: It seems like we are getting closer, albeit its not as easy as I think it should be. We need a variety of service providers and open source solutions in this space, so there are numerous, dead simple cloud options...[<a href="/2013/03/01/api-deployment-as-a-service/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>I spent time this week looking at 20, of what I&rsquo;m calling API reciprocity providers, who are providing a new generation of what is historically known as ETL in the enterprise, to connect, transfer, transform and push data and content between the cloud services we are increasingly growing dependent on. With more and more of our lives existing in the cloud and via mobile devices, the need to migrate data and content between services will only grow more urgent. While ETL has all the necessary tools to accomplish the job, the cloud democratized IT resources, and the same will occur to ETL, making these tools accessible by the masses. There are quite a few ETL solutions, but I feel there are 3 solutions that are starting to make a migration towards an easier to understand and implement vision of ETL: &nbsp; These providers are more robust, and provide much of the classic ETL tools the enterprise is used to, but also have the new emphasis on API driven services. But there are 10 new service providers I&rsquo;m calling reciprocity platforms, that demonstrate the potential with offering very simple tasks, triggers and actions that can provide interaction between two or more API services: I consider reciprocity an evolution of ETL, because of three significant approaches: Simplicity - Simple, meaningful connections with transfer and tranformations that are meaningful to end users, not just a wide array of ETL building blocks an IT architect has to implement API - Reciprocity platforms expose meaningful connections users have the cloud services they depend on. While you can still migrate from databases or file locations as with classic ETL, reciprocity platforms focus on APIs, while maintaining the value for end-users as well as the originating or target platforms Value - Reciprocity focus on not just transmitting data and content, but identifying the value of the payload itself and the relationships, and emotions in play between users and the platforms they depend...[<a href="/2013/02/28/from-etl-to-api-reciprocity-looking-at-20-service-providers/">Read More</a>]</p>

Making onboarding with an API as frictionless as possible is one thing I like to study and educate my readers about. While I was studying what I call the API reciprocity space currently, which is an evolution of what is known in the enterprise as ETL, I came across a company called FoxWeave.
FoxWeave is a service that can migrate and synchronize data across all your cloud and on-premise apps and databases.  When I went to &ldquo;try it now&rdquo; at FoxWeave, I was told &ldquo;no signup needed&rdquo;.  But I didnt&rsquo; think much about it until I saw the temporary guest account popup.

What a powerful concept.  Evolving the freemium concept into the world of anonymity, allowing me to play with and understand your service before having to commit in any way.  One less piece of friction when I&rsquo;m trying to understad a new tool or service.
Nice work FoxWeave.  Way to make interoperability and automation using APIs as frictionless as possible.

			<p><em>27 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>There is a great post by Lorinda Brandon (@lindybrandon) of SmartBear on ProgrammableWeb today called&nbsp;Governance vs Innovation: Do They Have to be Enemies?. &nbsp;She continues a conversation, from API Strategy &amp; Practice around the word "governance", and how in the API space, this is often considered a bad word. &nbsp; I was moderating the questions for Alistair Farquharson (@afarqu)&nbsp;CTO of&nbsp;SOA Software, when&nbsp;Irakli Nadareishvili (@inadarei) of&nbsp;NPR actually agreed that it is a bad word and asked if we need to evolve beyond it and not embrace it. &nbsp;I totally agree with Lorinda's approach to walking the line between governance and innovation, and look forward to more discussion around how to analyze API vs SOA principles within the enterprise--striking a balance that works for each individual approach. To help stimulate this conversation I wanted to break down the word, governance. &nbsp;In the context of IT, governance is: a concept used for activities related to exercising control over services in a service-oriented architecture (SOA). The definitions of SOA governance agree in its purpose of exercising control, but differ in the responsibilities it should have. Some narrow definitions focus on imposing policies and monitoring services, while other definitions use a broader business-oriented perspective With general definitions being: the persons who make up a body for the purpose of administering something the act of governing; exercising authority I think the illness around the word, when it is applied to APIs becomes clear when you start looking at the synonyms: Governance - administration, authority, bureaucracy, command, control, direction, domination, dominion, empire, execution, executive, guidance, influence, jurisdiction, law, ministry, patronage, political practice, politics, polity, power, powers-that-be, predominanc Management - administration, care, charge, command, conduct, control, direction, governance , government, guidance, handling, intendance, manipulation, operation, oversight, rule, superintendence, superintendency, supervision Regulation - adjustment, administration, arrangement, classification, codification, control, coordination, direction, governance , governing, government, guidance, handling, management, moderation, modulation, reconciliation, regimentation, reorganization, settlement, standardization, superintendence, supervision, systematization, tuning Let's separate the potentially bad...[<a href="/2013/02/27/what-is-a-better-word-for-governance-when-it-comes-to-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>While I&rsquo;m wading through dictionaries and thesauruses in an effort to find a more appropriate term &ldquo;governance&rdquo;, when looking at SOA governance through the API lense--I figured I&rsquo;d flush out another area I&rsquo;m working to define a term that appropriately describes automation and interoperability using APIs. Yesterday I took a look at 31 backend as a service (BaaS) providers, in hopes of understanding more about what value they provide. Today I'm diving into the automation section of my new API trends area. While reviewing, I noticed the exact same companies that were under automation were also in interoperability. So I set out to find a new word to apply to this next generation of ETL providers that are building bridges between cloud platforms using APIs, as well as legacy data connections. I have settled on the word reciprocity. The dictionary defines reciprocity as: the quality or state of being reciprocal : mutual dependence, action, or influence a mutual exchange of privileges; specifically : a recognition by one of two countries or institutions of the validity of licenses or privileges granted by the other When you look in the thesaurus, reciprocity has a definition of "interchange" with synonyms of cooperation, exchange, mutuality and reciprocation. Reciprocity is also a synonym of connection with a definition of &ldquo;person who aids another in achieving goal&rdquo;. With synonyms being acquaintance, agent, ally, associate, association, contact, friend, go-between, intermediary, kin, kindred, kinship, mentor, messenger, network, reciprocity, relation, relative and sponsor. &nbsp;(i love that "kin" is a synonym too) All of these terms apply to what I&rsquo;m seeing unfold with this new generation of ETL providers. ETL is moving into the clouds, and out from behind the firewall, using the open web, cloud platforms and APIs, and now we have to rethink ETL, and make it accessible to the masses. Put it within reach of the everday problem owners. What I really like about reciprocity is it describes the mutual relationship between...[<a href="/2013/02/27/merging-api-automation-and-interoperability-into-api-reciprocity/">Read More</a>]</p>

One of the questions I asked the group was, which of the three OAuth Legs is the most important? &nbsp; To provide a quick primer for the portion of my audience that aren&rsquo;t OAuth geeks: OAuth is an open standard for authorization that provides a method for clients to access server resources on behalf of a resource owner Ok, what does that mean? Think Twitter. Twitter is server. You are the owner of your tweet resources. When you authenticate anywhere using your Twitter ID, that website or app uses OAuth to get access to your tweets, via the Twitter platform. If you login to your Twitter account, click on settings and select apps from the left menu--these are apps and sites that have requested OAuth access your Twitter resources. OAuth is a relationship between you, your platform provider and various sites and apps that want to access your data via the API. Sometimes these apps and your platform provider are one and the same, but the beauty of OAuth&nbsp;is that anyone can request access from you--access that you can revoke when you choose. Back to the panel at API Strategy &amp; Practice. Every panelist, except for Asif Rahman of Newscred said that the most important leg of oAuth is the end user. This made me happy because it shows that, at least at #APIstrat, people are concerned with the interest of the end user. This is healthy. In reality, I worry that when platform discussions do occur, the conversation leans too much in favor of platform, then the developer, with very little to no involvement of the end user.

			<p><em>26 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer in the power of the freemium model when it comes to APIs. Nothing is as it seems when you are deploying managing or consuming APIs. You have to have room to innovate and iterate without signing contracts or paying too much, before you find exactly the right integration or deployment that works. This freemium approach to APIs is one of the biggest reasons I&rsquo;ve been supporting 3Scale since early days of API Evangelist. 3Scale was the original API service provider to offer a truly freemium tier for anyone wanting to deploy an API, and remains passionate about this to this day. During the API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in NYC last week, I had the pleasure of meeting the SmartBear team, who share a similar perspective of the space, resulting in them launching a new suite of free tools that will help you develop, test and monitor while building API driven software. SmartBear has published four new free tools for testing and development: SoapUI is a free and open source cross-platform Functional Testing solution. With an easy-to-use graphical interface, SoapUI allows you to easily and rapidly create and execute automated functional, regression, compliance, and load tests. LoadUI is a free, open source, Web Services load testing solution. With a visual, drag-and-drop interface, it allows you to create, configure and redistribute your load tests interactively and in real-time. LoadUI supports all the standard protocols and technologies. D&eacute;j&agrave;Click is an easy-to-use and powerful addition to your web browser for web macro recording that turns multi-step web interactions into one-click super-bookmarks. Markup and annotate web pages, run web performance tests, and share recordings. Leverage those scripts with AlertSite to measure, diagnose, notify and report on web performance and user experience from an end-user perspective. Deliver fast, feel-good customer experiences from your online store. The AlertSite for Magento extension enables webstore owners to quickly see at a glance the current availability of their ecommerce site...[<a href="/2013/02/26/freemium-api-tools-can-drive-experimentation-and-innovation/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>26 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Backend as a Service (BaaS) provider QuickBlox announced new pricing plans, which includes a free tier up to 10GB in traffic and storage, with unlimited API calls and push notifications.
The BaaS space is heating up with lots of discussion about whether you should charge developers by active user, features, storage or API call--with each provider being pretty vocal about where they stand.  Quickblox is approach similar to StackMob, who refuses to charge based upon API call, atributing it to a sucess tax. But Quickblox is somewhat different, as they still charge for hard costs like bandwidth and storage--Stackmob only charges by feature.
I'm trying to understand all the approaches to BaaS pricing, which was also a panel discussion last week at API Strategy &amp; Practice between Parse, Stackmob, Kinvey, Kii, Cloudmine and Firebase.  I don't think there is a one size fits all strategy here, but I predict the conversation around BaaS pricing will continue to heat up in 2013 as the market continues to define itself.

			<h3><a href="/2013/02/26/api-transparency-report-as-essential-building-block/">API Transparency Report as Essential Building Block</a></h3>
			<p><em>26 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>After reading about Google&rsquo;s release of their transparency report last month, I decided I would be addding API transparency reports to my list of essential building blocks for API owners. Since I wrote that, I&rsquo;ve had a great post from EFF also stating that its time for transparency reports to become the new normal. &nbsp;Where the EFF outlines the illness in our current approach: When you use the Internet, you entrust your thoughts, experiences, photos, and location data to intermediaries &mdash; companies like AT&amp;T, Google, and Facebook. But when the government requests that data, users are usually left in the dark. In the United States, companies are not required by law to alert their users when they receive a government request for their data, and in some circumstances, they are explicitly prohibited from doing so. So it is up to us, the users to join organizations like the EFF and let all online service providers understand the importance of transparency reports becoming default operating procedure. Currently, we are only seeing transparency reports from providers like Google, DropBox, LinkedIn, Twitter and a handful of other service providers. While I feel that all companies that run on users data should provide transparency reports, I&rsquo;m going to focus on making sure it is standard operating procedures with companies that deliver APIs. As a starting point for my API transparency report building block, I&rsquo;m using the letter that was drafted by concerned privacy advocates who are calling for Microsoft to issue a transparency report on Skype, which it purchased in 2011 for $8.5 billion. This letter states that: Skype is a voice, video and chat communications platform with over 600 million users worldwide, effectively making it one of the world&rsquo;s largest telecommunications companies. Many of its users rely on Skype for secure communications&mdash;whether they are activists operating in countries governed by authoritarian regimes, journalists communicating with sensitive sources, or users who wish to talk privately in confidence with business...[<a href="/2013/02/26/api-transparency-report-as-essential-building-block/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m currently tracking on 31 backend as a service providers, in an effort to better understand how this new breed of platforms are helping developers build web and mobile apps. After looking at all the BaaS providers, there are 13 clear leaders: Then there are another 18 other players, trying to play catch up in a space that is working hard to define itself in 2013: My goal is to better understand what features are offered across these 31 BaaS providers. To accomplish this, I spent no more than an hour per provider looking through their sites and playing with their products to get at least a basic understanding of their offerings. When looking for features I tried to standardize the best I could, but it is difficult when there are different approaches to the deployment of resources on each platform. I found about 75 distinct features being offered across the 31 BaaS providers. I&rsquo;m sure there are other features, and vital details missing, but I wanted to start somewhere.

			<p><em>25 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>One of the lively discussions at the API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in NYC last week was the backend as a service (BaaS) panel I moderated towards the end of the first day. We brought together Ilya Sukhar (@ilyasu) of&nbsp;Parse, Morgan Bickle (@morganbickle) of&nbsp;Kinvey, Marc Weil (@marcweil) of&nbsp;Cloudmine, Miko Matasumura (@mikojava) of&nbsp;Kii, Ty Amell (@tyamell) of&nbsp;StackMob&nbsp;James Tamplin (@jamestamplin) of&nbsp;Firebase to talk about the fast growing BaaS space. I kicked things off with some pretty standard stuff, by having each person introduce themselves and explain what they do. Next I asked them to explain what differentiates themselves from the other folks on the couch. After that, things started heating up when I brought up a discussion about BaaS pricing, from an earlier online discussion about the mertits of user, feature or pricing base upon number of API calls. The common approach is user or api based pricing, with Stackmob focused on feature based BaaS pricing. BaaS panel is actually really really interesting. Great line up. #apistrat &mdash; Ilya Bagrak (@ibagrak) February 21, 2013 The conversation was definitely lead by Ty Amell of StackMob, with pointed rebuttals from Ilya Sukhar of Parse, with Miko Matasumura of Kii in between, being very diplomatic while also throwing some jabs of his own. Morgan Bickle of Kinvey, Marc Weil of Cloudmine and James Tamplin of Firebase held their own, but it things were definitely overshadowed by the discussion by Ty and Ilya. Super interesting trust issue: &ldquo;[What happens if your BaaS gets acquired and pulls a Posterous?]&rdquo; #apistrat &mdash; r. kevin nelson (@rknLA) February 21, 2013 Next the panel moved the discussion to the future of Baas, with direct questions about what potential exit strategies are for each of the platforms. At times the panel seemed like a reality show from the BaaS world or a daytime talk show featuring the leaders in the BaaS space. The Backend as a Service panel really showed the personalities behind the leading companies...[<a href="/2013/02/25/the-baas-reality-tv-show-panel-at-apistrat/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>25 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>
I see a lot of dead simple, yet meaningful uses of APIs come across my desk (I don&rsquo;t have a desk, why do I keep saying this?) each day.  One I saw today is something every school, whether K-12, college or university should have.
Using the UC Berkeley API, you can get a list of all departments:
_curl -v -X GET "https://apis-dev.berkeley.edu/cxf/asws/department?departmentCode=a&amp;app_id=309fe68e&amp;app_key=51b9d67dc4f0501eed763822a641b17b"_
Then with the proper department code you can pull a list of classes:
_curl -v -X GET "https://apis-dev.berkeley.edu/cxf/asws/classoffering?departmentCode=ARCH&amp;app_id=your-id&amp;app_key=your-key"_
With the proper keys, anyone can easily pull relevant UC Berkeley department and class data to use in website or app, or even populate a Google Spreadsheet for other purposes.

The UC Berkeley API Management Portal is brand new, I&rsquo;m still working on separate story regarding their approach, but I wanted to talk about how good it is to see such straightforward, valuable uses of an API at a leading university.
This simple example is something you should be able to do by default at all schools across the country.
The best part is that the API team is actively communicating these uses of the API on Google+, which is how I came across the story.

			<p>Its the Monday morning after the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference. The conference went off without a hitch, and was exactly the conference I envisioned when 3Scale first contacted me seven months ago about the idea of putting on the event. &nbsp;In July of 2012 Steve Willmott the CEO and founder of 3Scale sent me an email stating: ..we're thinking of finally getting round to organizing an API focused event (conference) which tries to help spread knowledge about API, promote good practice and broaden the API tent beyond what it is today. The aim would be an event which combined both "business and practice" - meaning one element which tackles critical topics such as business models, strategy, success stories etc. and another which is about "what can be done with APIs" and "how to make it happen technically". Closing with: The final important thing is we'd like it to be a very open event - with a range of supporters, speakers and attendees and - while vendors might sponsor - it wouldn't be a "vendor" event. To which I responded with: Sounds like a great idea to me. I'm in, and willing to help in any way I can. Of course I would be in. I&rsquo;ve wanted this type of conference to occur for a while now, and what better way to make sure it happens right, than doing it yourself! It was an amazing opportunity for me--there was no ignoring it. As many of you know the original conference was scheduled for November 1st and 2nd in New York, City. But due to hurricane Sandy, we had to postpone the conference and we ended up rescheduling it for last Thursday and Friday, February 21st and 22nd at the same venue--the Westin Grand Central in NYC. In the end, the conference ended up with about 350 registered (SOLD OUT),with about what appears to be about 275-325 floating around each day, coming and going listening to...[<a href="/2013/02/25/exactly-the-api-strategy-amp-practice-conference-i-envisioned/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
Salesforce has a pretty cool Code Share&nbsp;area within the DeveloperForce ecosystem, which allows developers to share code snippets with the rest of the community.
Its a pretty cool way for anyone to share their techniques as code samples in a variety of languages, then letting the community vet the code, fork larger projects, and collaborate to improve the code for the greater good.
Acknowledging that they don't have the internal resources to fully support the process, Salesforce has halted code samples submission, announcing plans to migrate the Code Sharing program to Github.
Github is already the largest code sharing platform, providing social tools that developers are used to.  Salesforce's publiclackowledgement that they don't have the internal resources to operate, the fact they identify the importance of such a program, and the decision to migrate to Github are all very savvy moves by the API pioneer.
Github is one of the most important platforms you can use to support your API.  Using Github to host all your API code samples and SDKs, whether they are generated internally or by your developers community is becoming more than a novelty, but an essential part of API operations.

I was checking out the updates to the AWS Reference Architecture, where they provide blueprints for how you can use AWS. In this version AWS provides an e-commerce architecture reference--providing a system overview, a detailed architectural diagram, and a list of the AWS services used in the architectural approach.
The AWS e-commerce architecture reference provides three separate areas:

Web Frontend - This is a reference architecture for the web frontend of an e-commerce site. It makes use of Route 53, CloudFront, Elastic Beanstalk, S3, ElastiCache, DynamoDB and CloudSearch
Checkout Pipeline - This is a reference architecture for a secure and highly available checkout pipeline service for an e-commerce site. It uses the Virtual Private Cloud, the Simple Workflow Service, Elastic Beanstalk, the Relational Database Service, and the Simple Email Service
Marketing &amp; Recommendations Service - This is a reference architecture for a marketing and recommendation service for an e-commerce site. It uses Elastic MapReduce, S3, Elastic Beanstalk, the Relational Database Service, DynamoDB, and the Simple Email Service

Beyond providing the detailed reference card, AWS provides more information on a three-day course in AWS Architecture Training that will be held in numerous U.S. cities this spring.
I will add API architecture references as a building block for API owners to consider when planning and managing an API.  If you can provide clear blueprints for developers to follow, you can increase the chances developers will be successful with integration of an API into their application or systems.

The API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference is happening next week in NYC. I have had so much fun pulling together the schedule of keynotes, panels, sessions and the talks on the 429 - Too Many Requests stage. &nbsp;
The number of requests we've received for sponsoring, speaking and attending has been overhelming. &nbsp;Resulting in a sold out conference, and an amazing lineup of speakers. &nbsp;I was spending some time tidying up the speakers page and sponsor page today, and was so impressed with the companies involved, I had to share.
There are 72 companies represented at API Strategy &amp; Practice:




























































































































































































































I don't know about you, but I'm pretty blown away by the list of companies that will be attendance. &nbsp;I'm stoked we were able to pull together such an awesome lineup. &nbsp;I wish I could publish a list of companies who are attending, because that list would equally blow your mind. &nbsp;

Palo Alto has opened up city data, including operational data about the Palo Alto City Library.  Using the Palo Alto City open data portal you can access machine-readable data sets about various aspects of library operations including visitor count, checkouts by type of materia, information and circulation services, programs attendance, website visitors count and how library funds are spent.
The Palo Alto open data portal provides widgets with data grids and charts derived from data.  But you can also&nbsp;request data sets and access data via the City of Palo Alto's API.

			<p><em>12 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>The Backend as a Service (BaaS) space is picking up momentum in 2013. I&rsquo;m tracking on 20 BaaS providers, in hopes of better understanding what is being offered in this space. Today I came across an interesting new, open source BaaS platform, being developed in the European Union called OPENi. The project describes itself as: OPENi is a European Union ICT Framework Programme (FP7) Information and communications technology (ICT) Collaborative project. Over the 30 month project duration we aim to deliver an open-source, cloud based platform for integrating mobile services. With a mission to: Our mission is to inspire innovation in the European mobile applications industry, by radically improving the interoperability of cloud-based services and trust in personal cloud storage through the development of a consumer-centric, open source mobile cloud applications platform. With the following objective: OPENi&rsquo;s objective is to directly address the lack of interoperability between cloud based services and enable applications to access and use a broad spectrum of existing cloud based functionality and content, consistently across different devices and platforms, in a way that enables a user-centric application experience. Targeting the needs of Application Developers, Services Providers and Consumers, OPENi will realize its vision for user-centric, cloud-connected, mobile applications. OPENi is a 30 month project, we will have to wait and see what comes out of the iniative. With the EU approach to open data and data privacy, I think there is a lot of potential to deploy and consume APIs, as well as delivering API automation, interoperability and backend platforms that have a healthy, consumer-centric approach--which I believe will be good for business, because its good for ender users. In early 2013 the OPENi team will release software for the BaaS platform as an open-source project on github.com. When released I will evaluate it side by side with the other BaaS providers I&rdquo;m tracking on.

			<p>
Facebook launched a new video channel last week, dedicated to keeping developers up to date on the latest news, tutorials, speaking sessions from the Facebook developer ecosystem.
Facebook is going to provide content for web and mobile developers, with attention in other specialty areas like gaming and information for publishers.
The first edition of the channel will be recorded live on February 19th, with Director of Product Doug Purdy, with the top 3 things every mobile developer needs to know.
I'm adding a video channel to my list of API building blocks.  I don't think you have to be a Facebook before you have your own channel.  Using Google Hangouts + Youtube is an easy way for any API owner to start their own video channel to support developers.

			<p><em>10 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time lately thinking about emerging trends in API usage. One area I&rsquo;m tracking on, is around companies that are offering simple services that provide interoperability and automation between cloud platforms, using APIs. The best known examples are from companies like If This Then That (IFTTT) and Zapier, who provide end users with simple icon based tools for defining tasks that move data between SaaS platforms. Its tough to define this space, which in enterprise speak is really just Extract Transform Load (ETL), which is historically a process to migrate information between systems in an enterprise, using data sources and web services. But with the popularity of web APIs, we need to rethink ETL in the context of the cloud and update how we approach interoperability between the growing number of API driven platforms. Mike Reich of Seabourne, and I were discussing this last time I was in Washington D.C., and he currently has a great blog post on rethinking ETL for the API age. If you don&rsquo;t know Seabourne, they are behind high profile government projects like MyFCC and GovInfo. They have been doing a lot of thinking about how to acquire, process and publish content with APIs. To better help me&nbsp;better understand the space, I&rsquo;m watching 12 service providers that I&rsquo;m putting in a bucket of what I consider the next generation of ETL providers: Cloudwork - Cloudwork is a service that allows users to automate tasks between Google Apps, Salesforce, Evernote, Zoho, Twitter, Freshbooks, MailChimp, Zendesk, Dropbox, WordPress and others. &nbsp; &nbsp; Elastic.io - elastic.io helps you to automate routine operations and connect multiple cloud APIs. &nbsp; &nbsp; Foxweave - FoxWeave is a Cloud-Based Data Integration Platform that lets you easily migrate and synchronize data across all your Cloud and On-Premise applications and databases, without having to write any code. &nbsp; &nbsp; If This Then That (IFTTT) - IFTTT is a service that enables customers to connect channels...[<a href="/2013/02/10/bringing-etl-to-the-masses-with-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been processing a conversation over at Branch, that was triggered by a story in TechCrunch by Sarah Perez(@sarahintampa) called, &ldquo;StackMob Ratchets Up The Competition: Makes API Calls Free, Launches A Marketplace For Third-Party Mobile Services&rdquo;. There are several layers to the convSteersation, the part I&rsquo;m focusing on is about how BaaS providers are structuring their pricing, in which Sarah Perez writes: StackMob is now making API calls free. This latter news will impact the competitive landscape, which includes startups like Parse, Kinvey and others, all of which have traditionally charged developers as API calls increase alongside an app&rsquo;s popularity. Making the argument that: Today, developers have to have an understanding of how many API calls they make, and if an app becomes really successful, developers are penalized for that with increased pricing. Sarah quotes StackMob CEO Ty Amell, saying that: &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t really all that fair, explaining that it doesn&rsquo;t matter to StackMob how many API calls the app makes &ndash; the cost to them doesn&rsquo;t really go up. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter to us whether someone&rsquo;s making a million API calls or 20 million API calls &ndash; the cost is fairly manageable on our parts. So we felt like this was a blocker to innovation on the developer&rsquo;s side,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;And we feel like API calls are starting to become a commodity, where it&rsquo;s really how can you provide value beyond that?&rdquo; The conversation immediately begins on Twitter, with: Steve Gershnik(@StackMobSteve) of Stackmob - @stackmob doesn't charge for 'active users' either. No success tax for you. Joe Chernov (@jchernov) of Kinvey - but you charge for features. In the end, everyone charges for something. It's business! After this, the conversation moves to Branch. I&rsquo;m not including full comments, because there is a lot of banter back and forth, discussing various claims BaaS providers make, that I feel are irrelevant to the more important, pricing story.

			<p><em>05 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>
There is an interesting post on the Parse blog about instaDM, which is a service built using Parse, the BaaS platform, that provides private messaging in the Instagram ecosystem.
This is a very interesting approach to externally developing features for another platform or service.  I think Parse says it well:
Even the hottest new apps, however, aren&rsquo;t perfect and that&rsquo;s where clever innovators can fill in the gaps with a great idea. Parse-powered instaDM is one such innovation.
On one hand, this approach is a gamble.  All Instagram has to do is copy what you've done, put it in the roadmap, and your done. &nbsp;Finished.
On the other hand, I think this is a very realistic way of pushing a platform forward, by external developers, using APIs.  If an API provider is smart, when you have someone in your ecosystem roll out a valuable feature like this, you invest in their success.
Building features that augment web or mobile apps like this demonstrate that API ecosystems offer a lot potential for innovation, and I have to say it is even more interesting that this is being built on Parse--probably a whole other story in itself.
I don&rsquo;t think every idea that comes out of Silicon Valley should be VC size. APIs allow more lots of smaller, more sustainable features to emerge, that don't need large scale investment. instaDM is an example of this potential.

			<p>
Salesforce talked a little bit about its strategy around the development and release strategy around the Salesforce Eclipse plug-in. &nbsp;Providing a little transparency into how they stagger its API releases as well as waiting to release their Eclipse plug-in, until API release is complete.
I&rsquo;m more interested in this story from an API building block perspective.  An eclipse plug-in seems like a building block for only the most mature APIs out there, and especially ones targeting the enterprise.  An eclipse plug-in is not for every API, but I think I will add it as a building block to consider.
It also seems like something a 3rd party provider could step up and find success with as well, by building a single or suite of Eclipse plug-ins that provide integrated API developer tools across popular or high value web APIs for Eclipse users.
I believe IDE plug-ins for APIs will be one way we can provide API discovery solutions for developers, by bringing valuable, qualified API resources into their development environments.

			<p><em>04 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>
Google is adjusting their pricing model for the Adwords API, acknowledging that having a free usage tier is important. &nbsp;Making the API easier to access, while also ensuring a certain QOS.
Google has opted to go with two levels of API access:

Basic - Basic access is provided by default and allows up to 10,000 operations per day
Standard - Standard access is available to qualified developers and has no daily limit on operations

With both basic or standard access, there are no charges for AdWords API usage.  Google is just looking to maintain quality over which developers can hammer on the API, while acknowledging a free tier allows for experimentation and innovation. &nbsp;All you have to do is apply to be part of the standard level, if you reach limits of basic tier.
This is a good model for even a totally open data of free resource APIs.  While you want your data and resources to be open, you also want to be able to offer a certain quality of service, and keep infrastructure costs to a minimum.
To do this, you will need to to secure the API interface to some degree.

			<p>I did a presentation at the DC API Meetup, when I was in Washington DC last week. My talk was some of my usual material around the history, business and politics of APIs, but included a section on trends, where I covered some of the newer aggregation providers like Singly, BaaS providers like Parse and automation tools like IFTTT. At the end of the meetup, we did a QA panel session, and Javaun Moradi (@javaun), product manager at NPR digital, made a great point about the reliability and stability of this new generation of third party platforms building aggregate, backend, automation or other types of providers who are in turn, dependent on other API providers. Javaun questioned the reliability of this new generation of startups, who are newly funded, most likely not yet profitable, dependent on other APIs, and are most likely going to be acquired later on down the road, or go out of business when funding runs out. Javaun felt that established players like Salesforce and Google are here to stay, you know they aren&rsquo;t going anywhere--where a new startup has greater potential for service disruption and instability. If you are building your app, and depending on an aggregate API service like Singly, or backend as a service (BaaS) platform like Cloudmine or reliant on a automation platform like Zapier, you want to know the company is going to be around in a year. Right? In my opinion, the number one way these new breed of startups can alleviate these concerns, is by solving developer problems, delivering value (which every company I&rsquo;ve mentioned is doing) and have a clear business model. Success is the best solution, right? Another way these startups can instill confidence in the developers who are building apps around around their services is to also offer open source options.

			<p><em>03 Feb 2013</em></p>
			<p>For the longest time I would get asked, "Which API service provider should I use to deploy my APIs?". This was a tough question, because historically the API management providers don't help you deploy your APIs, they only help you manage them. Deploying your APIs was up to you. Generally you already had some sort of internal system that you would use to generate RESTful interfaces or you'd go find your own open source API framework and deploy. Then you'd proxy or connect your API to one of the API service providers. These lines are now blurred by providers like Intel with their enterprise API gateway, and through API deployment resources from 3Scale. 3Scale is investing in open source server technology for NGINX, and blueprints for API deployment using Amazon Web Services. 3Scale recently published a quickstart tutorial on how to deploy an API on Amazon EC2 for Amazon Web Services (AWS), and manage it using 3Scale API management. My favorite part is that everything in this tutorial is completely FREE. A critical element to experimenting with APIs. The 3Scale, AWS walk-though provides details for: Creating and configuring EC2 Instance Preparing Instance for Deployment Deploying a demo API solution Enabling API Management with 3Scale Implementing an Nginx Proxy for Access Control There are several important things going on here, beyond being able to do this for free with an entry level AWS and 3Scale accounts. But I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough, the value of this being free and allowing you to explore, experiment and iterate with your API--without spending a fortune! This is critical to not just your API initiative, but contributes to a more healthy API space in general. After being free, you are using proven open source technology like Ubuntu for server OS and NGINX for your web server. 3Scale has invested in tools for NGINX, rather than building their own proprietary solutions, because NGINX has been proven to deliver at scale and has...[<a href="/2013/02/03/deploy-and-manage-api-on-amazon-web-services-aws/">Read More</a>]</p>

I was listening to Did You Hear That? I Think It Was The Sound Of A Walrus, on NPR this morning.  It is about the Macaulay Library, which is:
...the world's largest and oldest scientific archive of biodiversity audio and video recordings. Our mission is to collect and preserve recordings of each species' behavior and natural history, to facilitate the ability of others to collect and preserve such recordings, and to actively promote the use of these recordings for diverse purposes spanning scientific research, education, conservation, and the arts.
The library's collection has a total of more than 7,000 hours of sounds, the result of an 80-year collaboration between the scientific community and the library's volunteer collaborators.  An amazing resource!
I couldn't help myself, and emailed them, to let them know a web API of the audio and video collection would be a great addition.  If developers could build web and mobile apps around the sounds, it would extend the reach of the catalog exponentially.
Of course you'd do it in a way that adds value to the collection and protects it as a brand and priceless asset.
The digitizing of the Macaulay Library, making it available online is a great example of the potential of open content, data and APIs.  Our world is full of rich resources like this, we just need to digitize and make accessible in sensible ways that make them available to the widest audience possible.

			<p>When I talk about API discovery, in-person at events, or on my blog(s), I notice people automatically default to thinking I mean a universal API discovery language that will work for all web APIs. I think the technologists that operate in the API space are always striving for technical perfection--resulting in the discussions that you see around REST, HATEOAS, OAuth and similarly for this one about API discovery. I&rsquo;m thankful for the passion and dedication of the technologists in this space, but when it comes to API discovery, I&rsquo;m never talking about a universal language or approach. I personally just don&rsquo;t believe there can be one definition to rule them all. When I reference API discovery, I&rsquo;m focusing on API discovery at the provider level, and providing information and resources that allow people who launch APIs to be successful. I have no interest in defining or support a world-wide or industry level definition for API discovery. I leave these conversations to all y'all tech pundits. I am a fan of supporting API providers to do something, anything! Sure, it should be a standardized as you feel necessary. I hope you use something that is already in existence like WADL, Swagger or I/O Docs (don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel), and make sure and look at the approach Google is taking with their API discovery service--as they have some experience in the field. In reality though, your motivation to develop JSON or XML definitions for your API will probably be to provide interactive documentation or allow for easy generation of code libraries for your API--not discovery. With the API discovery conversation automatically defaulting to a universal definition by the tech pundits, API providers will often avoid these discussions, leaving it a lower priority when planning and implementing an API. Much like with HATEOAS, without concrete examples of value, API providers won&rsquo;t see value in providing JSON or XML definitions of their APIs.

			<h3><a href="/2013/02/02/individual-api-deployments-will-get-smaller-and-more-numerous/">Individual API Deployments Will Get Smaller and More Numerous</a></h3>
			<p><em>02 Feb 2013</em></p>

Master API architect at Layer7 Technologies Mike Amundsen (@mamund) has a great post this week on Four Tech-Related Trends That Will Shape 2013.
One of the predictions that caught my eye was that "individual service deployments on the Web will get smaller and more numerous"--he clarifies it with:
Influenced by the existence of the many mobile apps running on a single device, Web-based services will become small, single-focused offerings that (in the words of Doug Mcllroy) &ldquo;do one thing and do it well.&rdquo; This will also explode the number of available services. The advantage of this trend will be an increase in the agility and evolvability of service offerings. The challenge will be an increased need for governance at the &ldquo;micro-service&rdquo; level.
I have to agree.  I think the smaller we can break resources down, the better.  Agility is key in the API economy.  But as Mike points out it won't come without its new set of problems, like life cycle, governance and discovery.
Much like web pages, I think we'll still try to estimate the number APIs available, but there will be so many, we will lose track in the near future.  But we'll find an organic approach to designing, deploying, managing, discovering and consuming web APIs that strikes a balance.
