<p>I’m working hard on what I consider to be my definition of a robust API deployment toolbox, and was enjoying the 100K perspective. As I explore, I wanted to share some of my thoughts about by you might expect to receive as a client in each of these scenarios.

<ul>
  <li><strong>SOAP</strong>: You get what the vendor says we can send to you in very structured way.</li>
  <li><strong>REST</strong>: Is this what you want? Let us know if it wasn’t via StackOverflow.</li>
  <li><strong>Hypermedia</strong>: We are prepared to send you whatever we want at any point in the future.</li>
  <li><strong>Microservices</strong>: You are just going get a little bit of this one thing.</li>
  <li><strong>GraphQL</strong>: You get exactly what you want, you better know what to ask for!</li>
  <li><strong>Websockets</strong>: Here you get that, and this, and that, and that…</li>
  <li><strong>PubSub</strong>: You get only the topic you wish to subscribe to.</li>
  <li><strong>Webhooks</strong>: Here you asked us to send this to you–here you go.</li>
  <li><strong>Event Architecture</strong>: You get something whenever that something happens.</li>
  <li><strong>gRPC</strong>: You get what we want really fast, and can accept what we want really fast!!</li>
</ul>

<p>It is fun to step back and think about the motivations, ideology, and pros/cons of each of these API deployment scenarios. I’d love to hear your additions or perspective on what you think the client view of the conversation might be. As I see the API universe continue to expand, I’m curious to see how others are seeing it.

<p>In coming months you’ll hear me write more about event driven architecture, gRPC, and how the pace of things are picking up when it comes to API consumption. I’m working with <a href="https://streamdata.io">Streamdata.io</a> to help try and map out this landscape, as well as some of the usual areas I focus on as the API Evangelist.
