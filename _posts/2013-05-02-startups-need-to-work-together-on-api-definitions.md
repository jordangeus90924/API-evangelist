{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am tracking on 2000 APIs that I have deemed worthy enough to pay attention, out of the 9000 on ProgrammableWeb, 13,000 in APIHub and numerous APIs in Mashapes marketplace.In addition to these APIs, Im also closely watching 30+ backend as a service providers, 20+ reciprocity providers and emerging big data, analysis, visualization and other emerging platforms who are using APIs in new ways.I was reading some of the great research coming out of OPENi, which is a Open-Source, Web-Based, Framework for Integrating Applications with Cloud-based Services and Personal Cloudlets--specifically the post on OpenI API Framework: Studying the Landscape of Cloud-Based Services.What is great about OPENi, is they are doing all this research and planning, and sharing the process with everyone publicly.Which is great for everyone, but will take some time to play out, as they study, plan and execute in the space.</p>
