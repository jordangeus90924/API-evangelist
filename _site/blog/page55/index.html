        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/12/open-source-baas-project-in-the-european-union/">Open Source BaaS Project In The European Union</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/baas/openi/openi-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The <a title="Backend as a Service" href="/trends/baas.php">Backend as a Service (BaaS)</a> space is picking up momentum in 2013.  I&rsquo;m tracking on 20 BaaS providers, in hopes of better understanding what is being offered in this space.  Today I came across an interesting new, open source BaaS platform, being developed in the European Union called <a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank">OPENi</a>.</p>
<p>The project describes itself as:</p>
<blockquote><em>OPENi is a European Union ICT Framework Programme (FP7) Information and communications technology (ICT) Collaborative project. Over the 30 month project duration we aim to deliver an open-source, cloud based platform for integrating mobile services.</em></blockquote>
<p>With a mission to:</p>
<blockquote><em>Our mission is to inspire innovation in the European mobile applications industry, by radically improving the interoperability of cloud-based services and trust in personal cloud storage through the development of a consumer-centric, open source mobile cloud applications platform.</em></blockquote>
<p>With the following objective:</p>
<blockquote><em>OPENi&rsquo;s objective is to directly address the lack of interoperability between cloud based services and enable applications to access and use a broad spectrum of existing cloud based functionality and content, consistently across different devices and platforms, in a way that enables a user-centric application experience. Targeting the needs of Application Developers, Services Providers and Consumers, OPENi will realize its vision for user-centric, cloud-connected, mobile applications.</em></blockquote>
<p>OPENi is a 30 month project, we will have to wait and see what comes out of the iniative. With the EU approach to open data and data privacy, I think there is a lot of potential to deploy and consume APIs, as well as delivering API automation, interoperability and backend platforms that have a healthy, consumer-centric approach--which I believe will be good for business, because its good for ender users.</p>
<p>In early 2013 the OPENi team will release software for the BaaS platform as an open-source project on github.com.  When released I will evaluate it side by side with the other BaaS providers I&rdquo;m tracking on.</p>

<p>Facebook is going to provide content for web and mobile developers, with attention in other specialty areas like gaming and information for publishers.</p>
<p>The first edition of the channel will be recorded live on February 19th, with Director of Product Doug Purdy, with the top 3 things every mobile developer needs to know.</p>
<p>I'm adding a video channel to my list of <a title="API building blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">API building blocks</a>.  I don't think you have to be a Facebook before you have your own channel.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/10/bringing-etl-to-the-masses-with-apis/">Bringing ETL to the Masses with APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-API-Automation.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time lately thinking about <a title="emerging trends in API usage" href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">emerging trends in API usage</a>. One area I&rsquo;m tracking on, is around companies that are offering simple services that provide interoperability and automation between cloud platforms, using APIs.   The best known examples are from companies like <a title="IFTTT" href="http://ifttt.com">If This Then That (IFTTT)</a> and <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, who provide end users with simple icon based tools for defining  tasks that move data between SaaS platforms.</p>
<p>Its tough to define this space, which in enterprise speak is really just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">Extract Transform Load (ETL)</a>, which is historically a process to migrate information between systems in an enterprise, using data sources and web services.  But with the popularity of web APIs, we need to rethink ETL in the context of the cloud and update how we approach interoperability between the growing number of API driven platforms.</p>
<p>Mike Reich of Seabourne, and I were discussing this last time I was in Washington D.C., and he currently has a great blog post on <a title="rethinking ETL in the API age" href="http://seabourneinc.com/2013/02/08/rethinking-etl-for-the-api-age/">rethinking ETL for the API age</a>.  If you don&rsquo;t know <a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/">Seabourne</a>, they are behind high profile government projects like <a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/">MyFCC</a> and <a title="GovInfo" href="http://govinfo.io/">GovInfo</a>.  They have been doing a lot of thinking about how to acquire, process and publish content with APIs.</p>
<p>To better help <span style="text-decoration: underline;">me</span>&nbsp;better understand the space, I&rsquo;m watching 12 service providers that I&rsquo;m putting in a bucket of what I consider the next generation of ETL providers:</p>

<p>I feel that this new group of ETL providers are focused sufficiently on the new world of API driven platforms, beyond just "data sources" and "web services".  There are more providers like <a href="http://apatar.com/">Apatar</a> and <a href="http://www.jitterbit.com/Solutions/etl-data-integration">Jitterbit</a>, but I feel these providers are more ETL than, than reflecting new breed of API interoperability providers (which I don&rsquo;t have proper name for yet).  One characteristic I&rsquo;m looking for is ease of use.  I think this new breed should be more for end-users, SaaS users and ultimately empowering the masses--not IT, which I feel ETL is designed for.</p>
<p>This new generation of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/interoperability.php">interoperability providers</a> should be about solving the problems average users face when operating online and in the cloud, and not just extracting, transforming and loading--making ETL something anyone can understand and put to use. &nbsp;Further democratizing IT resources, which is a common theme with SaaS, APIs, etc.</p>
<p>I think the new players like Zapier and IFTTT have to be concerned with getting too complex for everyday users, become more ETL, than being about solving end-user problems.  I think we will need very specialized, niche implementations--much like we are seeing with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/baas.php">BaaS</a> and the emergence of specialized versions like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/01/new-open-source-backend-as-a-services-platform-for-game-developers/">BaaS for gaming</a>.  Very niche versions of ETL like <a title="SortMyBox" href="http://www.sortmybox.com/">SortMyBox</a> and <a href="http://wappwolf.com/dropboxautomator/">WapWolf Dropbox Automator</a>, which focus only on solving file management problem users are facing, will be successful, because they are easy for users to understand and put to work.</p>
<p>I think there is an opportunity to quickly build the next generation ETL solutions that solve a set of automation, integration and interoperability problems for a niche audience using the simple icon based format we are seeing from providers like IFTT and <a title="Elastic.io" href="http://elastic.io/">Elastic.io</a>.  If you are considering building one of these new solutions, make sure and evaluate existing open source ETL solutions like:</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel, by rolling out your own ETL framework if at all possible.  This will allow you to focus on the specific acquire, transform and publish needs of your niche audience.  Even some of the new breed of providers are providing open source tools, like the <a href="https://github.com/rulesio/geekier/wiki">Geekier project</a> from <a href="https://rules.io/">Rules.io</a>, so do your homework. Also consider putting existing API aggregation providers like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> to use, providing faster acquire and publish API connections with popular APIs, while also standardizing the objects across all platforms.</p>
<p>I can envision video, photo, quantified-self and other niche services emerge that will empower any user to put APIs to use and acquire, transform and publish the valuable data, information and other content that are central to our increasingly fragmented online lives.  These new solutions will be framed in easy to understand terms that speak to specific audiences,  putting valuable API resources within reach of the masses.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/07/which-baas-pricing-model-is-better/">Which BaaS Pricing Model Is Better?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/baas-trends.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been processing a <a href="http://branch.com/b/apicalls-successtax">conversation over at Branch</a>, that was triggered by a story in TechCrunch by Sarah Perez(<a href="https://twitter.com/sarahintampa">@sarahintampa</a>) called, &ldquo;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/13/stackmob-ratchets-up-the-competition-makes-api-calls-free-launches-a-marketplace-for-third-party-mobile-services/">StackMob Ratchets Up The Competition: Makes API Calls Free, Launches A Marketplace For Third-Party Mobile Services</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There are several layers to the convSteersation, the part I&rsquo;m focusing on is about how BaaS providers are structuring their pricing, in which Sarah Perez writes:</p>
<blockquote><em>StackMob is now making API calls free. This latter news will impact the competitive landscape, which includes startups like Parse, Kinvey and others, all of which have traditionally charged developers as API calls increase alongside an app&rsquo;s popularity.</em></blockquote>
<p>Making the argument that:</p>
<blockquote><em>Today, developers have to have an understanding of how many API calls they make, and if an app becomes really successful, developers are penalized for that with increased pricing.</em></blockquote>
<p>Sarah quotes StackMob CEO Ty Amell, saying that:</p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t really all that fair, explaining that it doesn&rsquo;t matter to StackMob how many API calls the app makes &ndash; the cost to them doesn&rsquo;t really go up. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter to us whether someone&rsquo;s making a million API calls or 20 million API calls &ndash; the cost is fairly manageable on our parts. So we felt like this was a blocker to innovation on the developer&rsquo;s side,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;And we feel like API calls are starting to become a commodity, where it&rsquo;s really how can you provide value beyond that?&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>The conversation immediately begins on Twitter, with:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Steve <span>Gershnik</span>(<a href="https://twitter.com/StackMobSteve">@StackMobSteve</a>) of Stackmob</strong> - @stackmob doesn't charge for 'active users' either. No success tax for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Joe Chernov (<a href="https://twitter.com/jchernov">@jchernov</a>) of Kinvey </strong>- but you charge for features. In the end, everyone charges for something. It's business!</blockquote>
<p>After this, the conversation moves to Branch.  I&rsquo;m not including full comments, because there is a lot of banter back and forth, discussing various claims BaaS providers make, that I feel are irrelevant to the more important, pricing story.</p>
<p>The conversation continues:</p>
<blockquote><strong><strong>Joe Chernov (<a href="https://twitter.com/jchernov">@jchernov</a>)&nbsp;of Kinvey</strong>:</strong><br /> If a developer prefers to pay by number of users, our model may work for them; if someone would rather buy features, then StackMob may make more sense. It's all good. Everyone has their own twist on pricing. Vendors should strive to highlight their own value without misrepresenting others'. Fair?  Steve Gershnik (StackMob):<br /> We don't charge per user. We don't charge per API call. We think those are outdated and archaic pricing models.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Miko Matsumura (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikojava">@mikojava</a>) of Kii:</strong><br /> I respect what @StackMob is doing but in looking at their pricing page, isn't it just segmenting everyone into a free tier and a "custom" Enterprise tier?</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Steve Willmott(<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>)&nbsp;of 3Scale:</strong><br /> Which model is best in our experience depends a lot on what type of market you're serving - individual developers tend to like by the drop because (start cheaply and scale). Large companies tend to like predictability so they can budget properly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Box.net is a storage company - yet, for all their enterprise accounts storage is unlimited. Variable scared their customers. Instead they charge by number of seats/users - something their enterprise customers CAN predict.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Thinking more abstractly: If a developer is successful, there will be some sort of increase in volume. Unless the PAAS service is truly magical that means extra cost for the PAAS provider.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You can call this a success tax, but in my view what matters is not if there is more cost to the developer but if the unit cost goes down over time. I.e. As I succeed, I'm happy to pay you a bit more as long as you are not getting an increasing %age of the pie (and ideally if the %age is decreasing). If that %age increases I'll most likely ditch you for someone who offers me better terms at that point.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>QuickBlox(<a href="https://twitter.com/QuickBlox">@QuickBlox</a>): </strong><br /> Our pricing model is per API calls as well, we do it like that because it is clear for developers (and for our business model), also allows to create apps and prototypes that, in case they are not successful, the developers won't be charged. according to @jchernov</blockquote>
<p>Only Stackmob, Kinvey, Kii and Quickblox are represented in the <a href="http://branch.com/b/apicalls-successtax">conversation on Branch</a>.  So I wanted to see how each of the 20 BaaS providers I&rsquo;m tracking on, structure their pricing:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.apiomat.com/" target="_blank">APIOMAT</a> - Beta, can't find</li>
<li><a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/plans-pricing/" target="_blank">Appcelerator</a> - Events, Notifications, API Calls, Storage, Emails, Support</li>

<li><a href="https://parse.com/plans" target="_blank">Parse</a> - API Calls, Push Notifications, Data Storage</li>
<li><a href="http://www.proxomo.com/Pricing" target="_blank">Proxomo</a> - API Calls</li>
<li><a href="http://quickblox.com/pricing/" target="_blank">Quickblox</a> - API Calls</li>

<li><a href="https://go.urbanairship.com/accounts/register/" target="_blank">Urban Airship</a> - Push Messages</li>
</ul>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find pricing for five of the BaaS providers, because they are in beta, but pricing by API call is definitely the preferred way for the rest of them, with 11 of the 15 using this approach.  The rest of them charge based upon a mix of number of users, number of apps, data and file storage, push messages, and email messages.  With Stackmob going with pricing based upon feature, add-on or premium services, which can also be from 3rd party services via the <a href="https://marketplace.stackmob.com/">StackMob marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t think there is one approach to API or BaaS pricing.  Seems to me, that different models will work for different industries, companies and even at the application level.  But I wanted to document this conversation for my <a href="/trends/baas.php">larger research project around the BaaS space</a>--maybe I will have more opinions after I dive in deeper.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think about BaaS pricing.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/05/white-house-announces-round-two-of-the-presidential-innovation-fellows/">White House Announces Round Two of the Presidential Innovation Fellows </a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/presidential-innovation-fellows.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program, launched last year, bringing in talented individuals from the private sector, to Washington DC for 6-12 month &ldquo;tours of duty&rdquo; in the Federal Government, to develop innovative solutions to our governments most difficult problems.</p>
<p>Today the United States CTO Todd Park and CIO Steve VanRoekel&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/05/throw-your-hat-ring-round-2-presidential-innovation-fellows-program">announced round two of the Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program</a>.  The first round of PIF projects included MyUSA (formerly known as MyGov), RFP-EZ, Blue Button, Better Than Cash, and Open Data Initiatives started in August 2012 with 18 inaugural Fellows.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure to be <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/10/13/heading-to-washington-dc-to-talk-apis-with-innovation-fellows/">invited in October to spend half a day talking to a group of the fellows</a>, and help make sure they had an awareness of the API space, empowering the group to make the biggest impact possible.  Last week when I was in DC, I also got to speak with a couple of the fellows as they were finishing up their tour of duty, and beginning to think about what is next.</p>
<p>The second round of the Presidential Innovation Fellows will tackle the following initiatives:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Disaster Response &amp; Recovery</strong> - Collaboratively building and &ldquo;pre-positioning" needed tech tools ahead of future emergencies or natural disasters in order to mitigate economic damage and save lives</li>
<li><strong>MyUSA</strong> - Simplifying the process of finding and accessing information and government services that are right for you. Helping American businesses access the information and services that will help them grow, hire American workers, and export to foreign markets</li>
<li><strong>RFP-EZ and Innovative Contracting Tools </strong>- Making it easier for the government to do business with small, high-growth tech companies, and enabling the government to buy better, lower-cost tech solutions from the full range of American businesses</li>
<li><strong>Cyber-Physical Systems -</strong> Working with government and industry to create standards for a new generation of interoperable, dynamic, and efficient &ldquo;smart systems&rdquo; &ndash; an &ldquo;industrial Internet&rdquo; &ndash; that combines distributed sensing, control, and data analytics to help grow new high-value American jobs and the economy</li>
<li>MyData Initiatives - Empowering the American people with secure access to their own personal health, energy, and education data</li>
<li><strong>Innovation Toolkit </strong>- Developing an innovation toolkit that empowers our Federal workforce to respond to national priorities more quickly and more efficiently</li>
<li><strong>21st Century Financial Systems </strong>- Moving financial accounting systems of Federal agencies out of the era of unwieldy agency-specific implementations to one that favors more nimble, modular, scalable, and cost-effective approaches</li>
<li><strong>Development Innovation Ventures</strong> - Enabling the US government to identify, test, and scale breakthrough solutions to the world&rsquo;s toughest problems</li>
</ul>
<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows will also continue work on the <em><strong>Open Data Initiatives</strong></em>, which will accelerate and expand efforts to make government information resources more publicly accessible in &ldquo;computer-readable&rdquo; form and spurring the use of those data by entrepreneurs as fuel for the creation of new products, services, and jobs.  The Open Data Initiatives will continue work on existing projects including health, energy, education, finance and public safety and global development, while also tackling new data innovation efforts including Building Virtual Learning at National Scale, Digital Tools for the Smithsonian and  work on next iteration of Data.gov.</p>
<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows programs represents an agile new approach to government, mimicking the same partnership it took to build the Internet over the last 30 years, through a partnership between government and the private sector.  This approach is about tackling big problems, using open software and open data approaches to a government that is not just open, but machine readable by default.</p>
<p>Its great to see the White House not miss a beat, with kicking off the second round of PIF.  Iniatives within the program are addressing some of the most important areas of our society and economy like education and healthcare, while also paying attention to innovative areas like physical hardware systems, new approaches to financial systems and applying technology intelligently through disaster response and recovery.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to evaluate more of what was accomplished in round one, and closely track who is accepted into the program for round two.  I think the program has the potential to help fix some serious illnesses with open, transparency and lack of machine readable data from government agencies.  My only addition to the program would be another tier of volunteers called Presidential Innovation Corps, where talented individuals who did not make it as fellows could still be put to use for other smaller initiatives and crowdsourcing opportunities--this group represents a lot of excitement, passion and talent, and with the pool growing in round two it represents a large group of eager citizens not being put to use.</p>
<p>If you believe in APIs, and believe they can transform how our government operates, I encourage you to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/InnovationFellows">apply for the Presidential Innovation Fellows program</a>, and potentially participate in some serious change for our country.</p>

<p>There is an interesting <a href="http://blog.parse.com/2013/02/01/instadm-brings-private-messaging-to-instagram/" target="_blank">post on the Parse blog</a> about <a href="http://insta.dm/" target="_blank">instaDM</a>, which is a service built using Parse, the <a href="/trends/baas.php" target="_blank">BaaS platform</a>, that provides private messaging in the Instagram ecosystem.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting approach to externally developing features for another platform or service.  I think Parse says it well:</p>
<blockquote><em>Even the hottest new apps, however, aren&rsquo;t perfect and that&rsquo;s where clever innovators can fill in the gaps with a great idea. Parse-powered instaDM is one such innovation.</em></blockquote>
<p>On one hand, this approach is a gamble.  All Instagram has to do is copy what you've done, put it in the roadmap, and your done. &nbsp;Finished.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think this is a very realistic way of pushing a platform forward, by external developers, using APIs.  If an API provider is smart, when you have someone in your ecosystem roll out a valuable feature like this, you invest in their success.</p>
<p>Building features that augment web or mobile apps like this demonstrate that API ecosystems offer a lot potential for innovation, and I have to say it is even more interesting that this is being built on Parse--probably a whole other story in itself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think every idea that comes out of Silicon Valley should be VC size. APIs allow more lots of smaller, more sustainable features to emerge, that don't need large scale investment. instaDM is an example of this potential.</p>

<p>Salesforce talked a little bit about its <a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2013/02/new-eclipse-plugin-available-february-15th.html">strategy around the development and release strategy around the Salesforce Eclipse plug-in</a>. &nbsp;Providing a little transparency into how they stagger its API releases as well as waiting to release their <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> plug-in, until API release is complete.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more interested in this story from an <a href="/buildingblocks/">API building block</a> perspective.  An eclipse plug-in seems like a building block for only the most mature APIs out there, and especially ones targeting the enterprise.  An eclipse plug-in is not for every API, but I think I will add it as a building block to consider.</p>
<p>It also seems like something a 3rd party provider could step up and find success with as well, by building a single or suite of Eclipse plug-ins that provide integrated API developer tools across popular or high value web APIs for Eclipse users.</p>
<p>I believe IDE plug-ins for APIs will be one way we can provide API discovery solutions for developers, by bringing valuable, qualified API resources into their development environments.</p>

<p><a href="http://googleadsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2013/01/new-simplified-adwords-api-pricing.html" target="_blank">Google is adjusting their pricing model for the Adwords API</a>, acknowledging that having a free usage tier is important. &nbsp;Making the API easier to access, while also ensuring a certain QOS.</p>
<p>Google has opted to go with two levels of API access:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Basic</strong> - Basic access is provided by default and allows up to 10,000 operations per day</li>
<li><strong>Standard</strong> - Standard access is available to qualified developers and has no daily limit on operations</li>
</ul>
<p>With both basic or standard access, there are no charges for <a href="https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/" target="_blank">AdWords API</a> usage.  Google is just looking to maintain quality over which developers can hammer on the API, while acknowledging a free tier allows for experimentation and innovation. &nbsp;All you have to do is apply to be part of the standard level, if you reach limits of basic tier.</p>
<p>This is a good model for even a totally open data of free resource APIs.  While you want your data and resources to be open, you also want to be able to offer a certain quality of service, and keep infrastructure costs to a minimum.</p>
<p>To do this, you will need to to secure the API interface to some degree.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/platform-stability.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>I did a <a href="/2013/02/01/a-conversation-about-apis-in-washington-dc/">presentation at the DC API Meetup</a>, when I was in Washington DC last week. My talk was some of my usual material around the history, business and politics of APIs, but included a section on trends, where I covered some of the newer aggregation providers like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, BaaS providers like <a href="http://parse.com">Parse</a> and automation tools like <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the meetup, we did a QA panel session, and Javaun Moradi (<a href="https://twitter.com/javaun">@javau</a>n), product manager at NPR digital, made a great point about the reliability and stability of this new generation of third party platforms building aggregate, backend, automation or other types of providers who are in turn, dependent on other API providers.</p>
<p>Javaun questioned the reliability of this new generation of startups, who are newly funded, most likely not yet profitable, dependent on other APIs, and are most likely going to be acquired later on down the road, or go out of business when funding runs out.  Javaun felt that established players like Salesforce and Google are here to stay, you know they aren&rsquo;t going anywhere--where a new startup has greater potential for service disruption and instability.</p>
<p>If you are building your app, and depending on an aggregate API service like Singly, or backend as a service (BaaS) platform like <a href="http://cloudmine.me">Cloudmine</a> or reliant on a automation platform like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, you want to know the company is going to be around in a year.  Right?</p>
<p>In my opinion, the number one way these new breed of startups can alleviate these concerns, is by solving developer problems, delivering value (which every company I&rsquo;ve mentioned is doing) and have a clear business model. Success is the best solution, right?</p>
<p>Another way these startups can instill confidence in the developers who are building apps around around their services is to also offer open source options.  By offering API aggregation, backend and automation as a cloud service, while also as open source download and fork, this new breed of providers can do a lot to build confidence and goodwill with potential users.</p>
<p>Some good examples of this are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a></strong> - Singly AppFabric empowers you to add social login, sharing and friend finding into your mobile and web applications, and <a href="https://github.com/Singly/hallway">Singly Hallway</a> is the open source version to help developers build amazing applications combining data from many sources easily, through one API.</li>
<li><strong><a title="OpenKit" href="http://openkit.io/">OpenKit</a></strong> - Open source, cross-platform backend services for game developers.  It will be available as client and server download on Github, and no mention if it will be a cloud service</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://rules.io/">Rules.io</a></strong> - Rules.io is a rules and segmentation engine with companion <a href="https://github.com/rulesio/geekier/wiki">Geekier</a> which is part of the rules.io service as an open source framework</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just just a couple examples of how startups are emerging to provide a new approach to rapidly and efficiently building web and mobile apps across many APIs.  These platforms are all about delivering the resources developers need to efficiently build and manage web and mobile apps, without the overhead of rolling out the infrastructure on their own.  With an open option, if for any reason the startup should change or go away, app developers have the option to put the open codebase to use.</p>
<p>This approach will not be for all startups, but with the neck breaking pace in which startups are born, evolve and die, and open by default approached bundled with a healthy as a service option, looks like a positive approach for platform providers, developers, end users and the overall business sector.</p>
<p>As more providers emerge in this space, I hope they choose to adopt an open by default approach.</p>

<p>For the longest time I would get asked, "Which API service provider should I use to deploy my APIs?".  This was a tough question, because historically the API management providers don't help you deploy your APIs, they only help you manage them.</p>
<p>Deploying your APIs was up to you.  Generally you already had some sort of internal system that you would use to generate RESTful interfaces or you'd go find your own open source API framework and deploy.  Then you'd proxy or connect your API to one of the API service providers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.3scale.net/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>These lines are now blurred by providers like <a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/">Intel with their enterprise API gateway</a>, and through API deployment resources from <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>.  3Scale is investing in open source server technology for <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">NGINX</a>, and blueprints for API deployment using Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>3Scale recently published a quickstart tutorial on <a title="how to deploy an API on Amazon EC2 for Amazon Web Services" href="http://www.3scale.net/2013/02/quickstart-tutorial-on-how-to-deploy-an-api-on-amazon-ec2-for-amazon-web-services-aws-rookies/">how to deploy an API on Amazon EC2 for Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS), and manage it using 3Scale API management.  My favorite part is that everything in this tutorial is completely FREE.  A critical element to experimenting with APIs.</p>
<p>The 3Scale, AWS walk-though provides details for:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Creating and configuring EC2 Instance</li>
<li>Preparing Instance for Deployment</li>
<li>Deploying a demo API solution</li>
<li>Enabling API Management with 3Scale</li>
<li>Implementing an Nginx Proxy for Access Control</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several important things going on here, beyond being able to do this for free with an entry level AWS and 3Scale accounts.  But I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough, the value of this being free and allowing you to explore, experiment and iterate with your API--without spending a fortune!  This is critical to not just your API initiative, but contributes to a more healthy API space in general.</p>
<p>After being free, you are using proven open source technology like Ubuntu for server OS and NGINX for your web server.  <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/11/15/3scale-launches-open-source-api-proxy-build-on-ngnix/">3Scale has invested in tools for NGINX</a>, rather than building their own proprietary solutions, because NGINX has been proven to deliver at scale and has large community to support it.</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/nginx/nginx-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Third, with this solution, you retain control over your infrastructure.  You are deploying on the proven Amazon cloud (which I hope you are already using in other areas), and you are connecting to free API management services with the opportunity to buy premium services.  You are not proxying all your data and valuable API resources through a 3rd party proxy.  You are connecting to the API management services you need like rate limits, access controls and analytics without giving up control over your data and resources.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do the <a href="http://www.3scale.net/2013/02/quickstart-tutorial-on-how-to-deploy-an-api-on-amazon-ec2-for-amazon-web-services-aws-rookies/">3Scale API deployment tutorial</a>&nbsp;myself, so that I know the process inside and out, have my own AMIs ready to deploy on AWS, and be able to walk others through, when possible.</p>

<p>The library's collection has a total of more than 7,000 hours of sounds, the result of an 80-year collaboration between the scientific community and the library's volunteer collaborators.  An amazing resource!</p>
<p>I couldn't help myself, and emailed them, to let them know a web API of the audio and video collection would be a great addition.  If developers could build web and mobile apps around the sounds, it would extend the reach of the catalog exponentially.</p>
<p>Of course you'd do it in a way that adds value to the collection and <a title="protect it as a brand" href="/2013/01/29/protecting-your-brand-with-api-branding-guidelines/">protects it as a brand</a> and priceless asset.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/02/one-api-discovery-definition-to-rule-them-all/">One API Discovery Definition to Rule Them All</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">02 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/discovery/discovery-exploration.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I talk about API discovery, in-person at events, or on my blog(s), I notice people automatically default to thinking I mean a universal API discovery language that will work for all web APIs.  I think the technologists that operate in the API space are always striving for technical perfection--resulting in the discussions that you see around REST, HATEOAS, OAuth and similarly for this one about API discovery.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for the passion and dedication of the technologists in this space, but when it comes to API discovery, I&rsquo;m <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> talking about a universal language or approach.  I personally just don&rsquo;t believe there can be one definition to rule them all.  When I reference API discovery, I&rsquo;m focusing on API discovery at the provider level, and providing information and resources that allow people who launch APIs to be successful.  I have no interest in defining or support a world-wide or industry level definition for API discovery.  I leave these conversations to all y'all tech pundits.</p>
<p>I am a fan of supporting API providers to do something, anything! Sure, it should be a standardized as you feel necessary.  I hope you use something that is already in existence like <a title="WADL" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">WADL</a>, <a title="Swagger" href="http://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mashery/iodocs">I/O Docs</a> (don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel), and make sure and look at the <a href="https://developers.google.com/discovery/">approach Google is taking with their API discovery service</a>--as they have some experience in the field.</p>
<p><a href="http://swagger.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/Swagger-Screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In reality though, your motivation to develop JSON or XML definitions for your API will probably be to provide interactive documentation or allow for easy generation of code libraries for your API--not discovery.  With the API discovery conversation automatically defaulting to a universal definition by the tech pundits, API providers will often avoid these discussions, leaving it a lower priority when planning and implementing an API.  Much like with HATEOAS, without concrete examples of value, API providers won&rsquo;t see value in providing JSON or XML definitions of their APIs.  Interactive docs and auto generation of code libraries are clear value propositions, and show potential for bringing discovery back to the forefront.</p>
<p>Once you have API definitions for all of your API endpoints, its pretty easy to publish a single manifest of all of your APIs in a single JSON (or XML) file in the root of your developer area.  Sure I would love all of these definitions to be the same, but I prefer a more pragmatic approach and will accept whatever a API service provider deems suitable for their APIs, and with the resources they have available.</p>
<p>If you think about how web page discovery came together in late 1990s with Yahoo, then solutions provided by Google, and even new approaches from providers like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>.  When it comes to API search and discovery, we are in circa 1997, if we compare it with web page discovery.  You have directories like ProgrammableWeb, but you also have newer vendors emerging like <a href="http://apihub.com">APIhub</a>, who potentially bring a new perspective to the table.</p>
<p>Since APIs are about &ldquo;programmatic discovery&rdquo;, I think how developers discover API will vary, occuring via these directories and hubs, but also occur via their chosen PaaS platform like Drupal, Heroku, Salesforce or with BaaS providers like Parse or Kinvey--as well as popular IDEs like Eclipse who allow for plugins.</p>
<p><a href="http://apihub.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mulesoft/API-Hub-Screenshot-2.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It will up to PaaS, BaaS or other 3rd party platform providers to assemble resource stacks that are meaningful to their community.  They will do the legwork to find best of breed API resources, which will be made easier if API providers provider JSON or XML definitions of their API resources, but not a requirement.</p>
<p>I believe that similar to website sitemaps, API discovery will have wider definitions that some follow, with successful vendor specific implementations as well, but ultimately it will remain largely imperfect and some API providers will do well, and others will implement poorly. &nbsp;The markets will decide! (<em>cringe</em>)</p>
<p>My object is to help the average API provider hear stories of other successful approaches, and identify the benefits, in hopes that they will implement something, anything! &nbsp;Allowing us to take baby steps forward in API discovery, not defining one definition to rule them all and nobody giving a shit, and we don't move forward at all.</p>

<p>Master API architect at <a title="Layer7 Technologies" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7 Technologies</a> Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund" target="_blank">@mamund</a>) has a great post this week on <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/blogs/index.php/four-tech-related-trends-that-will-shape-2013/" target="_blank">Four Tech-Related Trends That Will Shape 2013</a>.</p>
<p>One of the predictions that caught my eye was that <em>"individual service deployments on the Web will get smaller and more numerous"</em>--he clarifies it with:</p>
<blockquote><em>Influenced by the existence of the many mobile apps running on a single device, Web-based services will become small, single-focused offerings that (in the words of Doug Mcllroy) &ldquo;do one thing and do it well.&rdquo; This will also explode the number of available services. The advantage of this trend will be an increase in the agility and evolvability of service offerings. The challenge will be an increased need for governance at the &ldquo;micro-service&rdquo; level.</em></blockquote>
<p>I have to agree.  I think the smaller we can break resources down, the better.  Agility is key in the API economy.  But as Mike points out it won't come without its new set of problems, like life cycle, governance and discovery.</p>
<p>Much like web pages, I think we'll still try to estimate the number APIs available, but there will be so many, we will lose track in the near future.  But we'll find an organic approach to designing, deploying, managing, discovering and consuming web APIs that strikes a balance.</p>

<p>One of the predictions that caught my eye was that "server mash-ups will increase but client mash-ups will decline"--he clarifies it with:</p>
<blockquote><em>The increasing popularity of languages like Node.js, Erlang and Closure will make implementing server-side mash-ups more efficient and easier to maintain than doing the same work within a client application; especially for the mobile platform. This will reduce the &ldquo;chattiness&rdquo; of client-side applications and increase the security and flexibility of server-side implementations. The result will be a perceived increase in responsiveness and a reduced use of battery power on mobile apps.</em></blockquote>
<p>As with my earlier post, <a title="individual API deployments will get smaller and more numerous" href="/2013/02/02/the-scientific-archive-of-biodiversity-audio-and-video-recordings-needs-an-api/">individual API deployments will get smaller and more numerous</a>, I agree 100%.  This is where I&rsquo;m going with my post this week on <a title="Virtual API Stacks" href="/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stacks</a>.  With so many individual resources available on the web, in the coming years we&rsquo;ll see increased &ldquo;mashing up&rdquo; or &ldquo;virtualization&rdquo; of new stacks, that are meaningful to a particular app or group of developers.</p>
<p>An example of this in the wild is&nbsp;<a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, with their API aggregation or mashup, which is available as a service, but is also <a href="https://github.com/Singly/hallway">available as open source on Github as Hallway</a>.  Another recent example is potentially the <a title="OpenKit Gaming BaaS" href="/2013/02/01/new-open-source-backend-as-a-services-platform-for-game-developers/">OpenKit Gaming BaaS</a>, which promised to be an open stack designed for game developers.</p>
<p>My predication is we&rsquo;ll see many more returns from server side API mashups, than we did during the client side mashup gold rush days! &nbsp;Especially if providers open source these stacks, while also offering as a service.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/01/traffic-and-weather-virtualized-api-stacks/">Traffic and Weather - Virtualized API Stacks</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://trafficandweather.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/traffic-and-weather/Traffic-and-Weather.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I recently added the <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather podcast</a> to the right hand menu for everyone to enjoy. What John Sheehan (<a href="http://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a><span>&nbsp;)</span> and Steve Marx (<a href="http://twitter.com/smarx">@smarx</a>) are doing on the podcast is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SO</strong></span> needed in the API space, I highly recommend subscribing to the podcast in your itunes and listening regularly.</p>
<p>I was honored to be critiqued in the podcast this week, where they &ldquo;gently&rdquo; disagreed with my post from earlier this week on my <a title="virtualized API stacks" href="/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">speculation around virtual API stacks</a>.  So I wanted to &ldquo;gently&rdquo; respond and help clarify.</p>
<p>The first 60 seconds, pretty much sum up rebuttal, where they make my argument for me by saying <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTT</a> and <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> are already doing this? Which is the whole basis for my story except I use <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and <a href="http://temboo.com">Temboo</a> as examples.  All of these providers are in the same space in my opinion, I think maybe they are just referencing what they are familiar with (as John used to work at IFTTT).</p>
<p>Second they read in that I&rsquo;m envisioning some grand discovery language?  Not sure where this comes from.  I&rsquo;m just referencing that API providers can provide JSON definitions of their APIs, which <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> happening with specs like Swagger, but not being done for discovery but for interactive documentation and code stub generation--the fact it is there is a plus for discovery.  But I have zero visions of there every being a grand &ldquo;standard&rdquo; for discovery, but I feel you can't argue Swagger is picking up momentum.</p>
<p>John and Steve also reference that I&rsquo;m calling for a &ldquo;standardized building blocks API providers can jump on?&rdquo;  Not sure where this comes from.  My arguement is that API will play almost no role in this process at all.  They won&rsquo;t give a shit or prepare in any way.  It will be 3rd party providers stepping up and building these abstracted platforms around existing API providers.  Something we are already seeing with Temboo, Singly and yes IFTTT and Zapier as well as BaaS providers like Kinvey, Parse, etc.</p>
<p>Then at the part they start talking about "API providers do not want to be commoditized", they lose me and deviate from anything I&rsquo;m talking about.  I agree that API providers don&rsquo;t want to be reduced to commodities.  This is just one possible path, and would not be for every API provider or reduce their existing retail relationship with developers.  We see it already happening with <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/07/25/sendgrid-partners-heroku-engine-yard-cloudbees/">SendGrid partners with Heroku, Engine Yard, &amp; others on email management</a>, and <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2012/twilio-partners-windows-azure/">Twilio partners with Azure</a>.</p>
<p>So SendGrid won't be commoditized on Heroku? &nbsp;Twilio won't be commoditzed on Azure?</p>
<p>Google your favorite API by name and add partners with, you will see API providers do care about partnering and reselling themselves, which brings you very close to the commodities line when you resell at that level. &nbsp;What I'm suggesting could just be interpreted as reverse partnering, where a 3rd party platform integrates the API, rather than API seeking partnership--which we see with Singly, IFTT and Zapier, they don't ask for permission from every API provider.</p>
<p>While I listened further, the rest of the conversation had nothing to do with my post.  I blame my storytelling, as I&rsquo;m always trying to perfect how i articulate my visions and obviously I didn&rsquo;t clearly get my point across.  Since it was my first exploratory post on this subject, I will keep trying, and trying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have to call them out a bit, cause I heard standard over and over in the podcast, about building blocks, API interfaces and API definitions.  But if you look at my post I never even used the word standard or standardizing or anything.  So I think you guys read something that wasn&rsquo;t there, cause I am the last API guy who believes in standardizing in the web API space.</p>
<p>With that said, I fuck&rsquo;n love that you guys are doing this!  Makes me happy! &nbsp;Thanks John and Steve!</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://data.worldbank.org/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/world-bank/The-World-Bank-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I had the pleasure of being on stage with <span>Tim Herzog (</span><a rel="user" href="http://twitter.com/tgherzog" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>tgherzog</a><span>)</span>, a Open Data Specialist from the <a title="World Bank" href="http://worldbank.com">World Bank</a> yesterday at the <a href="/2013/02/01/a-conversation-about-apis-in-washington-dc/">DC API meetup  at NPR</a>.  During the QA panel, at the end of the meetup, a question came from the audience, stating that open data from government is often boring, and thus is the reason much of what we see built on government isn't that exciting--alluding that there has to be more high value, exciting data that isn't being released.</p>
<p>While I agree that much of the data made available from open government initiatives is boring and stale, and there are probably much better datasets available, I also think this is more of a storytelling problem, than a data problem.  After the question was asked, I quickly answered by pointing to my left at Tim Herzog, and said the World Bank does an awesome job at this.</p>
<p>If you look through the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank data catalog</a>, and spend time looking through their blog, you see a symbiotic relationship between their open data, APIs and the stories they tell on the blog.  This approach is similar to what I'm calling <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a>, the only difference is I am hosting all my stories on Github as individual repositories.</p>
<p>If you look at the home page of the World Bank data site today, there is a link to the blog post, "<a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/what-does-data-tell-us-about-debt-of-high-income-and-developing-countries">What does data tell us about debt of high income and developing countries?</a>"  This is a great example of not just providing a dataset, but actually telling the story around the data, while providing tools that let you interact with the data, making everything a very hands on experience--increasing the chances users will make an emotional connection with the data.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/what-does-data-tell-us-about-debt-of-high-income-and-developing-countries" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/world-bank/World-Bank-Exernal-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>According to the blog post, the World Bank maintains two quarterly databases of information on external and public sector debt of many countries. The blog post narrates what the statistical data from the <a href="http://worldbank.org/qeds">Quarterly External Debt Statistics</a> (QEDS) and the <a href="http://worldbank.org/qpsd">Public Sector Debt Statistics</a> (PSD) databases tell us about trends in debt levels of some high income and developing countries, while also providing us with links to the data sets and JavaScript charts (using <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com">Tableau Software</a>) we can play with, making the story an interactive, hands-on experience.</p>
<p>This is <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a>.  It isn't just data.  It isn't just an API.  There is a story, giving the data context and meaning.  There are tools to help me play with the data, understand its value, with a link to the raw data for when I'm ready to get down to business.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that Hacker Storytelling is the solution to the boring data coming out of government, non-profit organizations and even in the private sector.  Hacker Storytelling is related to data journalism, but goes further, empowering anyone to publish a dataset and tell the story around it.  Not just journalists or programmers.</p>
<p>We need more open source tools that allow anyone to gather, curate and publish data, while also being able to wrap it in a story and bundle with interactive visualizations and tools that encourage exploration, remixing and sharing of these important stories that have the potential to solve real problems we face every day around the globe.</p>

<p><a title="OpenKit" href="http://openkit.io/">A new player in the </a><a title="Backend as a Service" href="/trends/baas.php">Backend as a Service (BaaS)</a> space has emerged, from former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFeint">OpenFeint</a> co-founder Peter Relan--called <a title="OpenKit" href="http://openkit.io/">OpenKit</a>. &nbsp;The new BaaS platform is targeting game developers, providing cross-platform tools for both iOS and Android. &nbsp;The core features of the gaming BaaS platform are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Cloud data sync</strong> - Save game progress in the cloud with data storage. Sync it across both iOS and Android devices for a consistent gaming experience</li>
<li><strong>Leaderboards</strong> - Drop-in leaderboard SDK's for both iOS and Android. Give your users the opportunity to compete against millions of other players</li>
<li><strong>Facebook &amp; Twitter auth </strong>- Users login with familiar third party social networks like Facebook and Twitter. No need to create and manage accounts. OpenKit handles it all</li>
<li><strong>Cross-platform support </strong>- OpenKit supports both iOS and Android. Our native SDKs are lightweight and will take just a few minutes to integrate into your game</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenKit represents a trend I&rsquo;m tracking on where people are pulling together specialized or <a title="virtualized stacks" href="/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtualized stacks</a> targeting specific groups of developers.  Early movers in the space like Kinvey, Parse and Cloudmine have generally catered to all types of developers by providing them a backend stack, that assists them in rapidly building mobile and web apps. So naturally the next step is to see more specialized stacks, for smaller groups of developers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stoked to see that OpenKit is completely <a href="https://github.com/openkit">open source, readily available on Github</a>, as well as comes out of the box with a REST API.  <a title="open source baas" href="/2012/08/28/open-source-mobile-backend-as-a-service/">Open source BaaS is something I was identifying was missing from the space</a>.</p>
<p>I will add OpenKit to my <a title="baas trends" href="/trends/baas.php">trends section for Backend as a Service</a>, where I&rsquo;m tracking on the BaaS space, and will dive in deeper and compare it with some of the other offerings we are seeing emerge.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/dcapi-january/dcapi-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I came to Washington DC this week for meetings with a couple federal agencies and a handful of private companies who contract with our government--including a conversation last night at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-Web-API-User-Group/events/97891662/">DC API Meetup Group</a>, which met at NPR offices downtown.</p>
<p>The API Meetup started with pizza, a healthy selection of beer and networking with around 50 API professionals and API curious from around the DC area.  I was able to meet about 15 folks I know online, but have never had the opportunity to connect with in real life.</p>
<p>Ben Balter (<a rel="user" href="http://twitter.com/BenBalter" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>BenBalter</a>), one of the Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) kicked off the conversation with a presentation of some of the cool API discovery, CSV to API, DB to API and various tool he's developed during his time as a innovation fellow.  I totally dig Ben's style, in making very small, but powerful open source tools that can make a real difference in how government opens up data via APIs.</p>
<p>I was up next, giving a talk titled, "<a href="/talks/apidays/business-models/">From Web, to Programmable Web, to Programmable World</a>".  I wanted to give everyone a healthy dose on the history of APIs, some views on where we are currently, and where API are going with an introduction to concepts like aggregation and automation.  The talk is meant to be a 200K foot walkthrough of the API space, which also reflects all of the sections available on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">APIEvangelist.com</a>.</p>
<p>Next up was Gray Brooks from the General Services Administration (GSA) who walked through some of the open data and API initiatives coming out of the federal government.  He is overseeing some very important aspects of the <a title="White House Digital Strategy" href="/federal_government.php">White House Digital Strategy</a>, and is the point person for the execution of the digital strategy across all federal agencies.</p>
<p>After Gray talked, Tim Herzog (<a rel="user" href="http://twitter.com/tgherzog" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>tgherzog</a>) the Open Data Specialist at the World Bank walked us through what the <a title="World Bank" href="http://www.worldbank.com">World Bank</a> is doing with their open data initiatives, which APIs are at the core.  He discussed how they couldn't have delivered their open data platform in the time and budget, without making it driven by APIs.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/dcapi-january/dcapi-7.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>Last up was Javaun Moradi (<a rel="user" href="http://twitter.com/javaun" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>javaun</a>)&nbsp;of NPR, who walked us through some of the lessons learned from deploying and managing the NPR APIs.  His talk was full of nuggets of wisdom, including "Don't build an API unless it solves a user problem" and "We drink our own champagne, because we don't make dog food!".  I'm hoping to spend more time this spring, doing a deeper dive into the NPR approach and share those insights in blog posts and ultimately a white paper.</p>
<p>We wrapped up with the presentations, grabbed another beer, ate some more pizza and networked a bit--then came back for a QA panel with everyone who presented, moderated by Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile</a>) of O'Reilly Media.  Alex did an awesome job at making the panel a conversation with everyone in attendance, encouraging open questions from the audience on APIs.  Alex is extremely knowledgable on not just open data and APIs, but how Washington DC operates, there is no better person to moderate a panel in DC.</p>
<p>The DC API Meetup Group is something I will be coming back regularly to attend and hopefully have the opportunity to present again.  They are looking for speakers and sponsors for future events, so if you have anything you'd like to share or make sure your company supports these valuable API conversations, you can contact Patrick Svenburg (<a href="https://twitter.com/svenburg">@svenburg</a>), Head of Business Development &amp; Partnering at <a title="APIphany" href="http://apiphany.com">Apiphany</a> and organizer of the DC API Meetup Group.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/01/29/protecting-your-brand-with-api-branding-guidelines/">Protecting Your Brand With API Branding Guidelines</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.active.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Active-Network/power-by--drk.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the top five concerns I hear from companies considering APIs is regarding losing control of their brand.  With APIs being about access to raw data and resources, companies immediately think that developers will extract the value, without any attribution or reference to the companies brand.</p>
<p>Even with this being a major concern, I see many APIs implement very poor branding guidelines, giving developers zero direction regarding how to properly provide attribution. &nbsp;This is a missed opportunity to not just protect the API providers brand, but actually extend it and increase its value.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I'm always on the lookout for good examples of API branding guidelines. &nbsp;One recent example I came across while monitoring my <a title="API Stack" href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a>, is from the <a title="Active Network" href="http://developer.active.com/">Active Network</a> which provides activity and outdoor content via their APIs.</p>
<p>Active Network starts with a great explanation of why they provide <a title="branding guidelines" href="http://developer.active.com/branding_guidelines">branding guidelines</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>At ACTIVE Network, we want you to be able to create fantastic applications with the ACTIVE Network APIs. At the same time, we don't want users to get confused about who is responsible for the data they are accessing, so we have some brand guidelines.</em></p>
<p>Next Active Network explains to developers why branding guidelines are important to their own users:</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.active.com/branding_guidelines" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Active-Network/Active-Branding-Guidelines.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.app.net/2013/01/28/announcing-the-app-net-file-api/" target="_blank">App.net has just released a File API</a> to add to their messaging and communication stack, allowing any App.net account to natively store files via the social platform.</p>
<p>Each App.net account will be given a 10GB file storage area, allowing applications to read and write files, that can be linked and embedded within App.net communications.</p>
<p>This approach reminds me of what I&rsquo;m seeing within the <a title="backend as a service" href="/trends/baas.php">backend as a service (BaaS)</a> space with other common developer resources like user management, object storage and key-value stores.</p>
<p>App.net is just making sure developers have the resources they will need to be successful building web and mobile apps with the App.net API--a similar motivation for BaaS providers as wel as other API providers.</p>
<p>While many developers are fine with using multiple API providers to get what they need, I can see an opportunity to provide the essential resources developers will need within the primary API that they are building their app around.</p>
<p>As essential API resources are further commoditized, it seems like an opportunity for private label BaaS resources to emerge.  File storage could become something that any API provider could offer alongside their own resources, without having to reinvent the wheel each time.</p>
<p>Maybe such services already exist under other names, and I'm unaware of it, but it seems like a great opportunity for cloud providers to step up and offer private label, backend resources for API providers to integrate into their platforms.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Virtualized-API-Stacks.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>Up until now we tend to think of APIs individually--we approach integration in terms of the Twilio API, Twitter API or the Facebook API.  But as the number of <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">public APIs has grown beyond 8K</a>, and an <a title="unknown amount of internal and partner APIs" href="/2013/01/24/estimating-the-number-of-non-public-apis/">unknown amount of internal and partner APIs</a> become available, we are seeing new patterns of <a title="aggregation" href="/trends/aggregation.php">aggregation</a> and <a title="interoperability" href="/trends/interoperability.php">interoperability</a> emerge from companies like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, but also seeing <a title="automation" href="/trends/automation.php">automation</a> be added into the mix by companies like <a title="Temboo" href="http://temboo.com">Temboo</a>, and entire backend stacks from providers like Parse.</p>
<p>These new aggregated or backend stacks of API driven resources can be as general as object and key-value stores, user management and other developer commodities we see <a title="backend as a service" href="/trends/baas.php">backend as a service providers</a> (BaaS) bring to the table, or they can be very personal like the photos Singly is aggregating across Flickr, Facebook and Instagram and with friends and followers across Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>As I see these new aggregate and BaaS providers emerge, at an ever increasing pace, I can&rsquo;t help but think--this still isn&rsquo;t fast enough (its my nature, you should try being me).  If I want common mobile developer resources I can adopt one of these new BaaS platforms like <a href="http://kinvey.com">Kinvey</a> or <a title="Parse" href="http://parse.com">Parse</a>, or if I need personal and social resources, which have <a title="fabric of mobile and web apps" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/11/13/the-api-fabric-for-next-generation-of-apps/">become part of the fabric of web and mobile apps</a>, I can go to Singly.  But what if I want a more specialized network, say just for <a title="education" href="http://hackeducation.com">education</a>?  I might need user management, object storage, key-value storage, access to commons social tools like friends and photos across multiple social networks, but I also need access to open courseware, teacher and student directories all via a very secure, auditable, efficient stack tailored just for K-12?  I will have to wait, for the next wave of startups to emerge.</p>
<p>While in NYC on Friday I had a great discussion with Temboo about virtualization.  Not just the virtualization we&rsquo;ve come to depend on with cloud computing--which is the virtualization of compute, storage, and database resources, but the <a title="virtualization of network resources" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_virtualization">virtualization of network resources</a> and <a title="software defined networking" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking">software defined networking</a>.  Companies like <a href="http://nicira.com/">Nicira</a>, <a href="http://www.pluribusnetworks.com/">Pluribus Networks</a>, <a href="http://www.anutanetworks.com/">Anuta Networks</a>, <a href="http://www.aristanetworks.com/en/solutions/network-virtualization">Arista</a>, <a href="http://www.vyatta.com/solutions/virtual">and Vyatta</a> are emerging with new products that are allowing the virtualization of networking resource into new and meaningful network stacks for any possible implementation that you can imagine.</p>
<p>After these conversation with the Temboo team, over the weekend I continued to think about the potential of virtualized API stacks.  Why can&rsquo;t I assemble my own API stack?  Why do I have to go to each API individually, or wait for new Singlys' to emerge in other verticals?  Why can&rsquo;t I assemble Parse, Singly, Twilio, Schoology, SendGrid into a virtualized API stack that provides not just ease of use, but the security I need to deploy a backend tailored just for K-12 education?</p>
<p>In this vision of the future, API providers could focus on what they do best, and not worry about every use case out there.  Providers like Singly, Temboo, Parse can build abstracted layers on top of this. With this abstraction I wouldn&rsquo;t be limited to just the friends and followers features on Twitter or Facebook, I could take advantage of the next generation of friend discovery tools like what Singly is delivering--in addition to the value of individual API providers.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/interoperability-trends.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>With a virtualized approach, I could build the stack that is most meaningful for my internal, partner or public developers and if one piece of my stack is proving unreliable, I can replace it with another.  APIs resources would be further commoditized, required to provide JSON definitions of their interfaces (or die a quick death), which virtual API stack platforms could use to discover and offer API resources.  <a title="API Ranking" href="http://theapistack.com/ranking.html">API ranking</a> algorithms would emerge allowing anyone to make sure they were discovering, selecting and using the best of breed API resources in the areas that matter for any vertical.</p>
<p>With a virtualized API stack I could launch any specialized set of resources that I desired from the best of breed providers out there.  I could blend private and public resources together and in return offer them for use in private or public environments, further blurring the lines of what is an API and how they are consumed.</p>
<p>As we see APIs continue to become a driving force in government, healthcare and education and bridge the online and physical worlds via our <a title="automobiles" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/automobiles.php">automobiles</a>, homes, <a title="buildings" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/buildings.php">buildings</a> and further grow within healthcare via the <a title="quanitfied self" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/quantified-self.php">quantified self</a>, potentially <a title="disrupt manufacturing with 3D printing" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/3d-printing.php">disrupt manufacturing with 3D printing</a> and drive everything around us with the <a title="internet of things" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/internet-of-things.php">internet of things</a>--the manual assembling of individual or even aggregated API stacks won&rsquo;t be enough.  We will need the ability to virtualize APIs stacks for any purpose within hours, not months or years.</p>

<p>API ecosystems are all about research &amp; development, and an opportunity for incubating ideas and apps in a way that invites 3rd party developers and companies to develop innovative ways of using your company assets and resources.  I&rsquo;ve discussed <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">incubation within an API ecosystem before,</a>&nbsp;and how companies are not just identifying developer talent and the best apps, but actually investing in companies via their API.</p>
<p>A new example of this in action is Nike's&nbsp;launch of their&nbsp;<a href="http://nikeaccelerator.com/index.html" target="_blank">Nike+ Accelerator</a>--a partnership with <a title="Techstars" href="http://www.techstars.com/">TechStars</a> that will host 10 companies for a three-month, immersive, mentor-driven startup accelerator designed to spur development on the&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.nike.com/">NikeFuel, the Nike+ FuelBand, and Nike+ Running API platform</a>.</p>
<p>The 10 partner companies will be given the following:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>$20,000</li>
<li>Access to the Nike+ APIs, Nike+ mobile SDKs, and Nike+ FuelBand Dev Kit (Beta) - you will be among the first in the world to receive this access</li>
<li>A Nike+ FuelBand for each team member</li>
<li>Tech support from experienced developers who've built companies, or built with Nike+ Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</li>
<li>Code and solution reviews during the program</li>
<li>Mentor sessions with Nike executives and leaders in the start-up community</li>
<li>Two Investor Demo Days: one at the Nike World Headquarters and one in Silicon Valley</li>
<li>Real Access to Decision Makers</li>

<p>Then, at the end of the Nike+ Accelerator, each team will present to Nike executives, mentors, angel investors, venture capitalists, and tech industry leaders.</p>
<p>As an API publisher have you considered a built-in accelerator or incubation program within your API ecosystem?  And while I&rsquo;m at it, has your incubator or accelerator consider a partnership program tailored for API publishers?</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/01/24/the-next-generation-of-api-discovery/">The Next Generation of API Discovery</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/Tag-Cloud-API-Discovery.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>For the last seven years, when you wanted to find an API you went to <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>.  It has been the definitive way to discover new APIs, and responsible for all the buzz in the space that has gotten the industry to where it is.</p>
<p>Now that <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">ProgrammableWeb is at 8400 APIs in its directory</a>, and adding 50-100 each week, it will continue to get even more difficult to discover APIs.  Even for someone like me who has looked at thousands of APIs, it can be very difficult and time consuming to find the API or APIs you are looking for.</p>
<p>In 2013 there are even more ways to find APIs, new approaches that are looking to define the next generation of API discovery and consumption.  Currently I&rsquo;m tracking on 4 API directories in addition to ProgrammableWeb:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="APihub" href="http://www.apihub.com/">APIhub</a></strong> - APIhub is the best way to publish, discover and consume APIs. Search our database or browse through our most popular APIs</li>
<li><strong><a title="APIs.io" href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a></strong> - APIS.io is an open source and free API registry service that allows developers to publish and discover REST APIs and interact with them online</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.exiconglobal.com/api-dir/">Exicon API Directory</a></strong> - Exicon helps marketers and enterprises find qualified developers through our online platform and advisory services</li>
<li><strong><a title="Mashape" href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a></strong> - Mashape provides a world-class marketplace to manage, distribute and consume both private and public APIs by developers from all over the world</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs.io and Exicon have the least amount of APIs available, but both Mashape and APIhub are currently leading, with Mashape possessing over 1500 and APIhub has over 13,000 APIs available.</p>
<p>In addition to providing the ability to search APIs and browse by category, these new generation of API directories are providing sophisticated tools like interactive documentation, code samples and ways to follow, share, like--providing social interactions for API developers with API publishers.</p>
<p>Beyond these new bells and whistles, what&rsquo;s next for API discovery?  To make developers lives easier they need programmatic ways to discover and understand APIs, as well as some sort of ranking to tell which are good and which are bad APIs.</p>
<p>To provide interactive documentation, these directories posses JSON definitions of each API interface, using formats such as <a title="Swagger" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/11/09/can-swagger-deliver-a-restful-api-discovery-service/">Swagger</a> from Wordnik, which opens up the door for more sophisticated discovery in a programmatic way, and potentially directly from within your IDE.</p>
<p>With the  data from the sharing, liking, following, page views and other signals generated via these API directories, there is a potential to develop some sort of ranking.  But we need more data signals from the space to truly develop a meaningful ranking.  I&rsquo;ve developed <a title="API Ranking" href="http://theapistack.com/ranking.html">my own API ranking</a> to help me discover which APIs are trending based upon internal and external signals, allowing me to establish my <a href="http://apistack.com">API Stack</a>.  But its not enough either.  We need a lot more to be able to establish a meaningful way to rank APIs, that truly benefits developer efforts.</p>
<p>As we are switching from showcasing the quantity of APIs, to better understanding the value and quality of APIs, we are going to need a new breed of directories.  I&rsquo;m excited by what I&rsquo;m seeing from these new API directories, and hopeful for what is coming 2013.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/googlecloudplatform">Google is going all in with its use of Github</a>, something I'm encouraging API owners to do.  They are working to manage all of their essential API tools there like their start projects, which show developers how to get started with Google APIs as well as other helper tools like the OAuth 2.0 Helper, that helps developers be successful.</p>
<p>Github provides a lot of benefit beyond the obvious aspect of open sourcing your code.  Google is actively engaging with developers using Github alongside all of these open source projects.  If you think about it, this offers a more compelling way to engage with API developers beyond forums.  On forums you end up with a lot of general, sometimes senseless questions--Github anchors questions or issues and pull requests around actual code libraries, SDKs, starter kits and other integration areas.</p>
<p>Github provides potentially more meaningful actions to occur between you and your developer community, beyond making code more accessible and openly licensed.  It is good to see Google going this route.</p>

<p><em>This post comes from the&nbsp;<a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://sdkbridge.com/">SDK Bridge</a>&nbsp;newsletter. &nbsp;I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you.</em></p>
<p>ProgrammableWeb is known for publishing the number of public APIs in its directory, and they regularly present an impressive&nbsp;<a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r-l-utikkyk-hdhyyhjli-j/" target="_blank">graph</a>&nbsp;that shows how this number has increased exponentially over time. However, not all APIs are public, and ProgrammableWeb is not able to obtain information on how many non-public APIs exist.</p>
<p>SDK Bridge writes API documentation as a service, and many of our customers have us document their non-public APIs. That puts us in a unique position to be able to estimate what percentage of APIs is public compared to non-public.</p>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>What exactly is a non-public API? For the purposes of this article, let's define a few terms.</p>
<p><strong>Public API.</strong>&nbsp;A public API is an API where the documentation is freely available on the Web. Using the API may require registering and paying a fee.</p>
<p><strong>Partner API.</strong>&nbsp;A partner API is an API where the documentation is not made available to the public, but is made available to select companies who have some kind of partnership agreement with the API provider. Typically the documentation is accessible through a password-protected website.</p>
<p><strong>Internal API.</strong>&nbsp;An internal API is an API that is only used by developers who work for the company that provides the API. Typically the documentation is available only on an internal website.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Since its inception in 2008, SDK Bridge has written documentation for 23 web APIs. (Web APIs are only a portion of the writing that we do for software professionals. We also write SDK documentation, IT documentation, and training curricula, as well as create video tutorials for developers.) Of these APIs, 12 were public, 9 were partner, and 2 were internal. The following pie chart shows the breakdown:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 200px;" align="center">

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Web API documentation by type.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For the non-public APIs (partner and internal), it's interesting to note that 82% were RESTful and 18% were SOAP APIs. Also, 91% supported XML formats and 18% supported JSON formats. This suggests that non-public APIs have mostly made the transition from SOAP to REST, but have largely not made a transition from XML to JSON.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Our data analysis indicates that roughly half of web APIs are not public. Two factors to consider:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>The sample size is still fairly small. As time goes on and we get a larger sample size, we will improve the accuracy.</li>
<li>Companies may be less inclined to hire outside writers for non-public APIs than for public APIs. This means that our data could easily result in an underestimation of non-public APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for now, if you are looking for a rough estimation of the total number of APIs, you can take the number published by ProgrammableWeb and double it.</p>

<p><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/transparency-report-what-it-takes-for.html">Google released an update to the Transparency Report today</a>, showing information regarding government requests for users' data on the Google Network.</p>
<p>Google's transparency report proves details on Government requests including who they come from, where the requests originate, types of requests and other critical information about how our government monitor us citizens and ultimately the entire world online.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/01/23/google-releases-new-government-surveillance-data-facebook-stays-mum/">stories on other blogs that state Facebook and other platforms should follow Google's lead with transparency reports</a> of their own.  I agree.  We will never see our government mandate industry leaders to do this, so us people have to lobby corporations to follow Google's lead.</p>
<p>I see this type of transparency being critical to any company claiming they have an "open platform" or "open APIs".  I will be adding transparency report to my list of <a title="legal building blocks for API owners" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">legal building blocks for all API owners</a>.</p>
<p>As more and more of our world, economy and daily lives moves online and are transmitted via APIs, investigations by our legal system and government are only going to grow.  We need to establish a way to report on these inquiries in real-time and in an open way like Google has been doing for two years now.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hacker-storytelling/Tag-Cloud-Hacker-Storytelling.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I love to write.  My girlfriend has really help me kindle this passion.  Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters/">@audreywatters</a>.</p>
<p>After 2.5 years of telling stories on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist</a>, I&rsquo;ve gotten pretty good at organizing my ideas, and putting out stories that showcase the best (and worst) from the Business of APIs.  I&rsquo;ve gotten so efficient at it in 2012, I even launched <a href="http://apievoice.com/">API Voice</a> which is dedicated to the politics of APIs, <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a> which is dedicated to top APIs and <a href="http://hackweekends.com/">Hack Weekends</a> which is all about hackathons.</p>
<p>When I meet people in the real world, I often hear, &ldquo;You sure blog a lot, I see like 5 posts a day coming from you!&rdquo;  I do write a lot, but it comes in waves.  I tend to write a lot of stories all at once, pumping out 15-20 pieces and then I trickle them out across the appropriate domain over the next couple days.</p>
<p>In 2013, I&rsquo;m going to get even more efficient with my storytelling, with an evolved approach I&rsquo;m calling <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com/">Hacker Storytelling</a>.</p>
<p>The process is based upon dwhat I already do, but uses a new blend of:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Pages</strong> - HTML, CSS and text that frames a site, project or research</li>
<li><strong>Blogs</strong> - Chronological blog posts that walk through a project or research</li>
<li><strong>Presentations</strong> - Deck.js presentations that walk through a project or research</li>
<li><strong>Data</strong> - JSON, XML or database stores that drive the essence of a story</li>
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - Simple, data and representations derived from APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>I use these formats to tell stories across my blog, but in 2012 I learned some new techniques with existing and new technology that &nbsp;I have discovered, and will be employing a series of technologies that help me better deliver stories:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Github Pages</strong></a> - A quick, easy and lightweight way to host websites on Github allowing anyone to build site with HTML, CSS and Javascript.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll#readme" target="_blank"><strong>Jekyll</strong></a> - Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website.</li>
<li><a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Mustache Templates</strong></a> - A simple way to render structured data from JSON files, using basic HTML templates for displaying--instead of pulling directly from database.</li>
<li><a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Deck.js</strong></a> - A JavaScript library for building modern HTML presentations. deck.js is flexible enough to let advanced CSS and JavaScript authors craft highly customized decks, but also provides templates and themes for the HTML novice to build a standard slideshow.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default all of my projects start as a Github repository with a base Github Pages + Jekyll implementation I&rsquo;ve setup for my API Evangelist brand.   This will force me to be open and transparent by default.  I know this reality isn&rsquo;t meant for everyone, but for me, I hate seeing many of my projects never leave the firewall and end up being deleted from an Amazon EC2 instance in the dungeon of my IT network.</p>
<p>All my projects will become <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> projects.  Some will have a single page, while others will have blogs, presentations and simple or complex data driven tools that help support the story.</p>
<p>Currently I have four projects who live in this new format and are hosted entirely on Github:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://theapistack.com">The API Stack</a></li>
<li><a title="Hack Weekends" href="http://hackweekends.com">Hack Weekends</a></li>
<li><a title="Hack Weekends Guide" href="http://guide.hackweekends.com">Hack Weekends Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://digitalstrategy.apievangelist.com">Digital Strategy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to be open by default, when it comes to content and data and make sure I share all of my ideas, in the widest and most shareable and remixable way possible.  My objective during my time on earth is to tell stories and write code that will make change, no matter how small.</p>
<p>I believe that <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> will help me do this!  I hope it will help you too!</p>

<p>Google has an <a href="http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2013/01/join-google-drive-sdk-early-access.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+GoogleAppsDeveloperBlog+%28Google+Apps+Developer+Blog%29">SDK early access program setup for the Google Drive platform</a>, and&nbsp;is inviting a select group of dedicated Google Drive developers to join the program. Giving them access to upcoming Google Drive SDK features and the opportunity to provide feedback.</p>
<p>Google isn't accepting everyone--they will be screening applicants based upon the type and quality of the application, number of users, and ability to implement and provide feedback on new features as they're made available.</p>
<p>An early access program seems like a good idea for API owners.  It gives you the chance to test out your alpha and beta APIs, client libraries, SDK's with a controlled audience, before you release them out into the wild.</p>
<p>With the number of developers Google has, I don't think it will be a problem getting developers to sign up.  But it seems like something you could even pay developers for, if you have a shortage of good developers in your API ecosystem.</p>
<p>An early access program fits right into earlier stories I've done on <a title="possible developer incentive ladders within API ecosystems" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/10/24/incentivize-your-api-developers-to-contribute-with-lower-pricing/index.php">possible developer incentive ladders within API ecosystems</a>.</p>

<p>WSO2's <a title="open source API management platform" href="http://wso2.com/products/api-manager">open source API management platform</a> for creating, managing, consuming and monitoring APIs, now has the ability to track API usage through Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Since APIs are deployed using HTTP, the same transport we are using for websites, it makes sense that we should be able to see statistics for both our websites and APIs, side-by-side using Google Analytics.</p>
<p>After creating a new profile for your API in Google Analytics you can put the tracking code into your WSO2 API Management interface and begin seeing real-time or standard (24 hour) reporting on API traffic in the Google Analytics interface.</p>
<p>Since Google Analytics has an API and widgets, you will be able to use this data easily in other reports or system integrations that may need access to your API usage data.</p>
<p>It is great to see innovation around API analytics and reporting, beyond the standard dashboards we've seen from most providers. I'd like to see more stories and scripts to help automate <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/03/31/api-metrics-and-analytics/">API reporting using Google Analytics</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/06/23/api-ecosystem-tracking-with-statsd-and-graphite/">StatsD and Graphite</a> or platforms like <a href="https://mixpanel.com/">Mixpanel</a>.</p>

<p>The event will be a 275 person conference focused on discussing the API industry.</p>
<p>Since the event was postponed after Hurricane Sandy, the demand to get in and speak was overwhelming and conference tickets didn&rsquo;t last long either.</p>
<p>We were able to keep almost all the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sessions.php">original session lineup</a> while make a couple changes and squeezing in a couple new speakers, where possible.</p>

<p>It has been a while since I provided an update on the White House Digital Strategy. &nbsp;I <a href="/federal_government.php">monitor the progress of federal agencies participation programmatically</a>, using JSON reports published by each agency at the agencies domain, /digitalstrategy.</p>
<p>After running the script today, I notice 20 federal agencies with active footprints. &nbsp;There are about five more, but there are issues with the JSON version of their digital stratgies--I really want to focus on the programmatic value. So, across these 20 agencies I find 76 data API initiatives&nbsp;and 75 mobile API projects.</p>
<p>To bring you up to speed, there are two specific milestones in the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government Strategy</a> that specifically address API deployment:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>2.2 (Data) -</strong> Make high-value data and content in at least existing two major customer-facing systems available through web APIs, apply metadata tagging and publish a plan to transition additional high-value systems</li>
<li><strong>7.2 (Mobile) -</strong> Optimize at least two existing priority customer-facing services for mobile use and publish a plan for improving additional existing services&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>To help shed light on where these progressive agencies are going with both their data and mobile intiatives I wanted to break them out into separate groups, for each agency.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-stack/API-Stack-Colored.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Finding APIs that compliment your API, and talking about the mutual benefits is nothing new.  When I worked with the <a href="http://mimeo.com">print API Mimeo</a>, I would write code that used Mimeo API in conjunction with <a title="Box API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=91">Box API</a> or <a href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=223">Dropbox API</a>.  Mashing up or bundling your APIs with other complimentary service can really help, when you are trying to explain the value your API delivers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to see patterns of even deeper integration and partnerships between APIs emerge--where one API provider will resell the API of another provider. &nbsp;APIs partnering with other APIs isn&rsquo;t that new, but reselling of each others API services to their developers is a fairly new concept, providing a potential new wholesale channel for API providers.</p>
<p>One recent example of this is in a recent <a title="partnership between Singly and Cloudmine" href="http://blog.singly.com/2012/11/12/teaming-up-with-cloudmine-for-backend-superpowers/">partnership between Singly and Cloudmine</a>.  Cloudmine is a <a title="BaaS Provider" href="/trends/baas.php">BaaS provider</a>, and Singly is provider of personal and social data via <a title="aggregate APIs" href="/trends/aggregation.php">aggregate APIs</a>. With the reseller approach, Cloudmine developers get a vastly improved stack to develop against, with <a href="https://cloudmine.me/">Cloudmine</a> providing all the essential BaaS tools developers are growing accustomed to, while also having access to 30+ social, personal and other aggregate API services provide by <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of this new approach is to provide developers with the most meaningful stack possible, in a single developer area.   A <a href="http://www.mogreet.com/">MMS API provider like Mogreet</a> could in theory, to better serve their developers, bundle image APIs like Flickr, Instagram and Facebook from Singly into their API area--providing a more robust stack to their developers who are building media enabled mobile apps.</p>
<p>Now developers don&rsquo;t have to traverse to each API area on their own.  APIs can mashup, bundle and develop a stack, which includes their own APIs, but might also have APIs from potentially several other API providers. &nbsp; Obviously there are lots of details to work out around authentication, pricing, etc., but the potential is obvious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also talking with a linguistics API provider in Europe, and learning more about their partner program, which would allow for 3rd party API providers to submit APIs and sell alongside their own linguistics API. &nbsp;Opening up their API stack for new opportunities and innovation from 3rd party linguistics API providers--in languages, formats they wouldn't have resources to do themselves.</p>
<p>As the number of APIs are growing, and we are seeing APIs aggregate via providers like Singly and through BaaS providers like Cloudmine, I think we&rsquo;ll see individual APIs become more portable, allowing them to be assembled into meaningful API stacks for developers. &nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/markdown-icon.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I just posted a story on <a title="how I like the Guardian&rsquo;s approach to data journalism" href="http://kinlane.com/2013/01/17/the-guardian-is-brilliant-in-supporting-relevant-events-with-open-data/">how I like the Guardian&rsquo;s approach to data journalism</a>, and spending time evolving on last nights <a title="Markup APIs" href="/2013/01/16/markup-apis-and-api-scripting-platforms/">thoughts about the possibilities of Markup APIs</a>.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/01/02/all-side-projects-are-now-hosted-on-github/">migrating much of the front-end of my websites to run on a home brew of Github Pages, Jekyll and JSON fueled Mustache Templates</a>, I am seeing more of the potential of not just Markup APIs, but Markdown APIs that will run in a purely client side environment.</p>
<p>Imagine if I could go to a provider like the Guardian, US Census or other high value data provider, grab a link to a Markdown API JavaScript file that is relevant to a story or report you are working on. &nbsp;With this Markdown API I would be given a whole dictionary of markdown you could use.</p>
<p>An example would be, that when I wanted the 2010 population for New York City, I could just write [population|New York|NY|US|2010], or something like that and would print out the actual population for that year in NYC, with a link to the source.  Each time I used a markdown API it would add some sort of attribution to the source at the bottom of document.</p>
<p>Seems like we&rsquo;d establish trusted, centralized sources of information, allowing anyone (even non-developers) to put open data and APIs to use via easy to implement markup or markdown APIs.</p>
<p>Think of the potential if facts around the web actually had the backing of trusted sources, and were able to be embedded anywhere on the web, via apps or digital documents.</p>
<p>It would be fun to create a markup and markdown API for API Evangelist, with a dictionary of terms, facts and other data that were relevant to the API industry.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/emergent-one-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank">Emergent One</a>, one of the newest <a href="/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/" target="_blank">API management players</a> on the block, just announced a new free development tier.</p>
<p>The Emergent One platform provides simple, cloud-based tools for connecting to your MySQL or PostgreSQL database, and quickly generating an API from your database.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t sign up for their service when they first launched, because they didn&rsquo;t have a free tier, and I&rsquo;m unwilling to put in credit cards and commit to brand new services. This is something I have problem with from running development and IT teams who use a wide variety of cloud services.  I would spend a great deal of time each month chasing down charges and other issues from cloud services that were being experimented with.</p>
<p>The Emergent One approach to deploying APIs from common data sources, is one I think will resonate with users who aren&rsquo;t developers, but understand the importance of APIs, and are often restrained by unresponsive, limited or no IT resources.</p>
<p><a href="https://emergentapi.com/cp/register?type=internal" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/emergent-one/Emergent-One-Get-Started.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Emergent One one is responding to user requests for a cheaper tier that support entry level API users, which will allow them to tweak their API strategies before spending money.  This is something I think is mandatory for all API service providers, something <a href="http://3scale.net/">3Scale</a> were the first movers on, and we have seen <a href="http://apigee.com/about/pricing">Apigee</a> implement recently, as well as&nbsp;<a href="/serviceproviders/layer_7_technologies.php" target="_blank">Layer7</a> with their <a href="http://www.apify.co/" target="_blank">Apify</a>.</p>
<p>I notice that in the email announcement of the 100% free tier, it encourages me to build new APIs at no cost, <strong><em>&ldquo;until launch&rdquo;</em></strong>.  I hope Emergent One will agree that a entry level pricing tier is not critical for users to get to know Emergent One, but essential for educating the masses about the value of APIs--allowing them to experiment. So le'ts please make sure it isn&rsquo;t only until launch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m setting up some APIs, directly from one of my Amazon RDS instances. &nbsp; I'll let you know when ready.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of APIs that do one thing and do it well, like <a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>.  I had lunch with the team from a similar API yesterday, called <a title="Mogreet" href="https://developer.mogreet.com/">Mogreet</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Mogree API" href="https://developer.mogreet.com/">The Mogreet API</a> lets you send and receive text or multimedia messages and use the platform to transcode, host and send video, audio and images for your web or mobile application.</p>
<p>When you think of the popularity of Instagram, the rebirth of Flickr and the ubiquitous value of photos and images online, it just makes sense that MMS is going to play a critical role in mobile app development in 2013.</p>
<p>I have a daughter, who sometimes responds to my SMS, email, chats and facebook messages.  Her attention span doesn&rsquo;t include always responding to her dad in "his" preferred formats. While she was visiting lately I sat on couch and watched her interact with friends and use her iPhone.   I noticed she communicated mostly in photos.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mogreet.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mogreet/mogreet-api-mms.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>She communicates by taking photos and sending them, tweaking or distorting them and writing messages before sending, and spent a lot of time surfing and sharing silly photos from around the web--all in a social way via her smart phone.</p>
<p>A picture is worth a thousand words.  I'm not good at math, but that seems 6x more valuable than a Tweet.</p>
<p>When you start thinking about which killer features will emerge in our mobile apps this year, I&rsquo;m sure the majority will depend on photos or videos, making MMS a pretty critical API resources to have in your developers toolbox.</p>
<p>After taking a look at Mogreet, I predict we will see them fueling the next crop of meaningful mobile apps, much like Twilio has done for the last two years.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/01/16/markup-apis-and-api-scripting-platforms/">Markup APIs and API Scripting Platforms</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/scripting-platforms/markup-api.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>Over the holidays I added a <a title="new section to API Evangelist called trends" href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">new section to API Evangelist called "trends</a>".  One of the areas I&rsquo;m tracking on is what I&rsquo;m calling &ldquo;<a href="/trends/scripting-platforms.php">scripting platforms</a>&rdquo;.  While you can program against any API using the language of your choice, these platforms are aggregating APIs and make available through a custom language stack.</p>
<p>This approach is different than what I&rsquo;m seeing from <a title="aggregate APIs" href="/trends/aggregation.php">aggregate APIs</a> like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>.  Scripting platforms may offer aggregate APIs, but are also providing a way to easily script against them, in new and abstracted ways.  I&rsquo;m <a href="/2012/12/19/taking-apis-to-next-level-with-api-scripting-platforms/">still trying to understand each company</a>, as well as the nuances between each approach--so stay tuned.</p>
<p>In the last couple weeks, I&rsquo;m seeing a possible new approach to programming against APIs come into focus, one that is using HTML instead of scripting--using Markup APIs.</p>
<p>After reading <a title="Building Bridges Between GUIs and Code With Markup APIs" href="http://www.toolness.com/wp/2013/01/building-bridges-between-guis-and-code-with-markup-apis/">Building Bridges Between GUIs and Code With Markup APIs</a> by Atul Varma (<a href="https://twitter.com/toolness">@toolness</a>) from Mozilla, you can really start seeing not just the potential around rich media and content like Mozilla is with its <a href="https://webmaker.org/en-US/">Webmaker platform</a>, but deliver any API resource in abstracted, simplified markup anyone can put to use--without knowing programming.</p>
<p>Lyre Calliope takes this further discussing how, &ldquo;Webmaker could be an opportunity to define an embeddable API strategy for the entire web&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;a Singly Markup API would lower the learning threshold for anyone interested in remixing all of their personal information together in new ways&rdquo;, in&nbsp;<a href="http://captaincalliope.net/2013/01/15/markup-apis-and-the-readwrite-web/">Markup APIs and the Read/Write Web</a>.</p>
<p>I envision Markup APIs, at their simplest working like <a href="http://mustache.github.com/">Mustache Templates</a> where you can easily render data from JSON templates, or be as robust as what Mozilla is doing with their Webmaker platform. &nbsp;Making the web embeddable and remixable like Lyre says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While scripting platforms are providing an important evolution in APIs for developers, by aggregating top APIs into new resources, the Markup API approach is an interesting evolution in APIs for everyone. &nbsp;And with <a href="https://singly.com/docs/data/authorization#Browser-based-Client-Apps">browser based authentication solutions like Singly's</a>, we can make this a very personalized experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working to understand all the possibilities, but I think both API scripting platforms and Markup APIs will bring us closer to a truly programmable web that is acceptable by everyone.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google/Google-Voter-Information-Widget.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I stumbled across the <a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/">Google Civic Information API</a> today, which allows developers to build applications around civic information including polling place, early vote location, candidate data, and election official information.  As soon as I landed on the home page, I scanned the left hand navigation, and noticed the option for "<a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/embed">embeddable tool</a>".</p>
<p>As you know <a href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=Embeddable">embeddable tools are are something I advocate all API owners</a> should consider when assembling the building blocks of your API.  I like Google's approach to the Google Voter Information Tool, which lets users look up their polling place, early vote sites, ballot, and election official information for the US 2012 General Election.</p>
<p>To support the embeddable tool, Google provides a quick overview, with instructions for "quick embed" and more granular options allowing anyone to configure region, address, local and other advanced settings.</p>
<p>Even though the 2012 election is over, I think Google's approach to providing embeddable tools with their APIs is potentially something that other API owners can follow, which will make your API accessible beyond just the developer community.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/netflix/netflix-square.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>The mission of API Evangelist is centered around telling stories from the API space, shedding light on the innovative things developers and API providers are doing across all business sectors.</p>
<p>Over the holidays I rolled my <a title="History of APIs" href="/history/">history of APIs series into its own section</a>.  It can be very difficult to understand who the players were in the API game, last year, let alone 10 years ago.  If there aren&rsquo;t stories about what happened in 2001, it can be very difficult to piece together the history.</p>
<p>In 2012 I also scaled up my API monitoring system to track the blogs and tweets of over 1000 APIs, providing a way for me to track activity across the space and establish my own <a title="API Ranking System" href="http://theapistack.com/ranking.html">API ranking system</a> resulting in what I cal&nbsp;<a title="The API Stack" href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a>.  This too is very dependent on API owners telling or sharing stories around their operations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tracking on over 1500 APIs and only 1000 have blogs and Twitter accounts.  With very few other signals to follow, such as stories in the blogosophere, social bookmarks on Hacker News and Reddit or QA on Quora or Stack Overflow--there isn&rsquo;t much to discover about these potentially valuable APIs.</p>
<p>At first, I felt there was a flaw in the way I track on APIs.  If an API offers value, but there are no stories for me to track on, it won&rsquo;t show up on my radar--leaving me feeling my approach could be flawed.</p>
<p>On the flip side, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/27/new-api-stories-in-2013/">going into 2013 I am eager to find &ldquo;new&rdquo; stories of APIs,</a> feeling like I&rsquo;m constantly telling stories of Amazon and Netflix--contrasting this with the lack of stories around 500 of my APIs, I felt there is an important link.  There is a reason I tell so many stories about Netflix isn't chance, it is because Netflix shares so much about its operations, providing fuel for my analysis and storytelling.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/netflix/daniel-jacobson-netflix.JPG" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>To shed light on this, I sat down with Daniel Jacobson (<a href="https://fr.twitter.com/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>), Director of Engineering for APIs at Netflix and asked him, <strong><em>&ldquo;Why does Netflix share so many stories about their operations?&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>It is very similar to why I tell stories on API Evangelist. &nbsp;Daniel asys it can be very positive to think about things, anticipating that you will share publicly, forcing you to see things in a different light.  That process can be very healthy, even without considering the after-effects of publicly sharing.</p>
<p>Ultimately Netflix shares its stories publicly to set itself as a thought leader, providing a marketing vehicle for the company when stories get picked up by TechCrunch or Mashable, but also sending signals to the world that Netflix is innovating and is a great place to work--additionally providing a valuable talent acquisition engine in a time when competition for talent is high.  <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/05/15/why-rest-keeps-me-up-at-night/">Look at posts from Daniel, on sites like ProgrammableWeb</a>.  What do you see in the last sentence...&rdquo;<a href="http://jobs.netflix.com/jobsListing.html?function=Engineering">we are hiring</a>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next I asked Daniel how, or if they measure and reported on the return on investment (ROI) from their public storytelling--number of hires, pageviews, syndication, etc.  He providing me with another link to talent acquisition--that ultimately they don&rsquo;t track on this, its based upon the response they get publicly and the feeling in their gut after each story is released into the wild.</p>
<p>Daniel related this approach to strorytelling with their internal <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664">culture of freedom and responsibility</a>.  When you work at Netflix, there is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> a lot of management and control, the culture is centered around good judgement, communication, impact, curiosity, innovation, courage, passion, honesty and selflessness.  In my opinion all qualities that can lead to good storytelling.</p>
<p>The Netflix storytelling process isn&rsquo;t a PR stunt.  Its truly about a genuine desire to share the story of their operations, the successes and failures--demonstrating their expertise and thought leadership not just in the movie and TV industry, but across the technology sector.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/netflix/netflix-reed-hastings.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>API Evangelist is my learning and storytelling platform.  It is rooted in my learning in real-time, and my desire to share these thoughts, in hopes others can learn along with me.  I&rsquo;m not seeking pageviews, I just want to share my view of the space, showcase the good and bad across all sectors, helping lead, in hopes that I can contribute to making the space as healthy as possible.</p>
<p>As an API provider, your blog, social networks, QA and forum activity is not just a PR mouthpiece.  It is how you will tell the stories around your platform, how you will share the value you deliver--educating users, developers and the public at large that you exist, and that what you are doing matters.</p>
<p>Without stories, your platform won&rsquo;t matter now or in the future--no matter how amazing your technology is.</p>

        <p><em>After looking back at 2012, I wanted a January 1, 2013 blog post for my blogs.  My first blog post of 2012 was my tour schedule for January, 2012.  While it was a pretty busy time for evangelizing and hackathons, I wanted something a little deeper.  I&rsquo;m not sure what, but I will play with the format year to year, until I find what I&rsquo;m looking for.</em></p>
<p><em>Every year I rewrite my bio, based upon where I am.  I&rsquo;ve been doing this since 2009.   This year I will write inaugural blog posts along with my bio rework, and post to each of my active blogs.  We&rsquo;ll see if it resonates again in 12 months and I do it again in 2014.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-voice/Tag-Cloud-API-Voice.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I started API Voice because I believe the politics of APIs is one of the most important areas that will make or break the API space.  APIs are not just technical.  There are a wide range of political issues facing companies when it comes to APIs.</p>
<p>The politics of APIs can range from terms of service issues to potential government regulation.  We are seeing the politics of APIs play out in the Twitter ecosystem and in the U.S. legal system with Oracle vs. Google.</p>
<p>My understanding of the politics of APIs still evolving.  I started API Voice in May 2012 to help me understand it more.  I&rsquo;m still trying to quantify all the areas, but so far the politics of APIs can include terms of use, data portability, branding, privacy, business models, service level agreements (SLA), acquisitions, copyright, regulation, patent and the ubiquitous, magical term &ldquo;open&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When I started <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, I wanted to provide a platform for research into the business of APIs.  Over two years I&rsquo;ve begun to solidify some perspective on the space, and form clear opinions around potential best practices.  With API Voice, I want to do the same for the politics of APIs.</p>
<p>At this point, all I can do is write about things as they unfold--as APIs are acquired and as they make the terms of service changes that impact developers.  API Voice is in its infancy, and I will be working to cover as many of what unfolds in 2013 as I can.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but feel that 2013 is going to be a big year when it comes to the politics of APIs.</p>

        <p><em>After looking back at 2012, I wanted a January 1, 2013 blog post for my blogs.  My first blog post of 2012 was my tour schedule for January, 2012.  While it was a pretty busy time for evangelizing and hackathons, I wanted something a little deeper.  I&rsquo;m not sure what, but I will play with the format year to year, until I find what I&rsquo;m looking for.</em></p>
<p><em>Every year I rewrite my bio, based upon where I am in my life.  I&rsquo;ve been doing this since 2009.   This year I will write inaugural blog posts along with my bio reworking, and post to each of my active blogs.  We&rsquo;ll see if it resonates again in 12 months, and I do it again in 2014.</em></p>

<p>API Evangelist is my obsession.  I started the blog in summer of 2012, in an effort to reinvent myself and find a career path that didn&rsquo;t just make sense for me, but also was something that would be around in a couple, while also returning something to society.</p>
<p>I believe API Evangelist is on course to do just this.  While focusing on the business of APIs, I am able to satisfy my sometimes ADD personality with a diverse range of subject areas ranging from social to the internet of things.  And by telling stories of the best practices in APIs, I&rsquo;m able to help provide much needed information to people planning, deploying and managing APIs in critical sectors like government, education and healthcare.</p>
<p>In 2010 when I began, it was clear to me that the technology of APIs was here to say, but there was a lot to learn when it came to the business of APIs, and evangelizing the value of APIs beyond developer community and Silicon Valley.  Two and half years later I feel that the business of APIs is progressing and much of the success I&rsquo;ve highlighted in the space is catching on with mainstream companies, with many business sectors are waking up to the potential.</p>
<p>In 2012 I felt an awakening.  An awakening that APIs exist, and the potential they possess in industries from telecommunications to government.  This wasn&rsquo;t just in the U.S.  I talked with people from France to Brazil about the importance of APIs.  Sitting here on January 1st, 2013, I feel we are on the verge of a pivotal year in APIs.</p>
<p>While APIs time has definitely come, there are many paths we can take from here when it comes to terms of use, business models or decisions around hypermedia that could benefit or severely damage the potential APIs can deliver.</p>

<p>To quote a friend of mine, APIs are very tactical. &nbsp;And because of this, I don&rsquo;t think we can make predictions. &nbsp;As API owners you can just focus on what you do best, solve your problems in real-time--while also making sure to look up from time to time and get your bearings in respect to the rest of the space and your industry.</p>
<p>I also hope as an API Evangelist I can maintain an awareness of the overall space, and provide news and analysis here at API Evangelist that will help you in your efforts. &nbsp;If you feel your story might help someone else in the space, make sure and reach out to me so I can help you get it out.</p>
<p>Happy New Year! &nbsp;Hang on, it is going to be an exciting year for APIs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/12/30/history-of-apis-programmableweb/">History of APIs:  ProgrammableWeb</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">30 Dec 2012</span>
        <p>While writing about the&nbsp;<a title="history of APIs" href="/history/">history of APIs</a>, it is easy to be so focused on just APIs, that you overlook the single most important player in the entire history of the web API--<a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>.</p>
<p>In July 2005, John Musser started ProgrammableWeb. According to his original about page:</p>
<p><a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/programmableweb/ProgrammableWeb-10-2005.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<blockquote><em>ProgrammableWeb is a web-as-platform reference site and blog delivering news, information and resources for developing applications using the Web 2.0 APIs.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>I started this site because I couldn't find what I was looking for: a technology focused&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2005/08/20/so-many-apis-so-little-time/">starting point for web platform development</a>. (For a bit more see my initial post.) Although no guarantees, the last time I started a reference site it somehow became Google's highest rated link on the topic. Given that this site will be a collaborative effort with community input as well, this can be what we make it.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>I hope you find the site useful.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>John Musser - Seattle, August 2005</em></blockquote>
<p>I think John&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2005/08/20/so-many-apis-so-little-time/">original blog post</a>&nbsp;on why he started ProgrammableWeb, says it all:<strong><em>&nbsp;Why? Because going From Web Page to Web Platform is a big deal</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Web APIs are a big deal! Whether its social networking, government, healthcare or education--having a programmable platform to make data and resources available will be a critical part of how commerce and society operates from here on forward. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>John made a early decision to showcase open and RESTful approaches to deploying APIs vs. parallel attempts of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Service Oriented Architecture</a>(SOA) and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">Web Services</a>, and focused on telling stories about open APIs--way before it was the thing to do in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>When I started API Evangelist in July 2010 (5 years after PW), and started talking about the business of APIs, the technology of web APIs was already widely accepted in Silicon Valley, because of the stories John Musser and Adam Duvander have told on ProgrammableWeb.</p>
<p><a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/programmableweb/programmableweb-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As we close 2012, a year in which I think we can confidently say APIs are moving mainstream, and I feel we owe much of the success to ProgrammableWeb. The stories John, Adam and other writers have been telling on ProgrammableWeb have been crucial to quantifying and defining the API industry--allowing us all to build, iterate and move things forward. Without stories around the technical, business and politics of APIs, these virtual interfaces would not have been able to find a place in our real life worlds.</p>
<p>Thanks John, Adam and ProgrammableWeb, for telling the stories that got us here.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://developerforce.com/developer-relations/2012/12/yearinreview.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/salesforce/developer-force-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>You can learn a lot from the <a href="/history/">history of APIs</a>, and following what the pioneers are doing. &nbsp;Salesforce isn't the coolest API within the Hacker News community, but when it comes to building an API ecosystem--Salesforce knows what they are doing.</p>
<p>I was reading through the <a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2012/12/yearinreview.html">Salesforce top developers highlights of 2012</a>. &nbsp;Their highlights doesn't just showcase the success of the community, but what Salesforce feels is critical to keeping their ecosystem healthy.&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>800,000 developers and climbing:</strong>&nbsp;the Salesforce Platform Developer Community is growing at an unprecedented rate.</li>
<li><strong>Cool new Salesforce technologies:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Identity">Identity</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Salesforce_touch_platform">Salesforce Touch Platform</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Force.com_Canvas">Force.com Canvas</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2012/9/19/announcing_heroku_enterprise_for_java/">Java on Heroku&nbsp;</a>for the Enterprise were released.</li>
<li><strong>Content is king:</strong>&nbsp;Great books such as&nbsp;<a href="http://media.developerforce.com/pdfs/salesforce_touch_platform.pdf">The Salesforce Touch Platform Mobile Development Guide</a>&nbsp;and Dan Appleman&rsquo;s new book&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Apex-Programming-Salesforce-com-Force-com/dp/1936754053">Advanced Apex Programming for Salesforce.com&nbsp;</a>hit the shelves.</li>
<li><strong>Community is making noise:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://salesforce.stackexchange.com/">Salesforce Stack Exchange</a>&nbsp;launched and is already at&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2012/12/salesforce-stack-exchange-qa-site-reaches-1000-users.html">1,000 users</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Force.com_User_Groups">Developer User Groups</a>&nbsp;have grown to 60 groups across the globe and climbing.</li>
<li><strong>New leaders have emerged:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.force.com/mvp_profile_andyb">Andy Boettcher</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.force.com/mvp_profile_junii">Junji Imaoka</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.force.com/mvp_profile_keir">Keir Bowden</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.force.com/mvp_profile_sanuki">Sanuki Ikou</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.force.com/mvp_profile_simonb">Simon Goodyear</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;are the most recent MVPs to join ranks of the&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.force.com/mvp">Force.com MVP Program</a>.</li>
<li><strong>We are staying connected, more often and in more ways:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.force.com/content/type/Webinar" target="_blank">Webinars</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.force.com/codetalk" target="_blank">CodeTalks</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgIMQe2PKPSJ8bIOnDSXihHEnEcgIiOfv&amp;feature=view_all" target="_blank">Google+ Hangouts</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/forcedotcom" target="_blank">Facebook</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/forcedotcom" target="_blank">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://boards.developerforce.com/sforce/?category.id=developers" target="_blank">Discussion Boards</a>, and the list goes on.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Events of Epic Proportions:</strong>&nbsp;10,000 Developers at Dreamforce &lsquo;12 with close to&nbsp;<a href="http://events.developerforce.com/conference/dreamforce">300 sessions</a>, Developer Zones at Cloudforce in New York, Tokyo, and London, and Developer Weeks in Brazil and India.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I hear when I read this list is that to get to 800K developers (holy shit), you need to constantly release new technologies, product resources and content to support your platform, give your community a voice with an emphasis on showcasing the leaders--while also engaging with developers both online and offline.</p>
<p><a href="http://developerforce.com/developer-relations/2012/12/yearinreview.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/salesforce/Force-Com-Developer-Relations.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Salesforce has been building their API ecosystem for 12 years! &nbsp;Twice as long as Twitter. &nbsp;What they highlight as part of their developer community in 2012 is something you should be doing in your own developer community.</p>
