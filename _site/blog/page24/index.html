			<p><em>09 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m doing my usual monitoring of the API space, and while looking at various developer areas, I stumbled across the Target Developer Portal. I find the Target developer portal interesting because it is publicly available, but before you can get any information you have to register or login.
When you land on the landing page for developer.target.com you simple get a page that says:
Please Note: Access to the developer portal is restricted to Target employees and trusted third parties that currently have a working relationship with Target Corporation. Registration requests that do not meet these guidelines will be rejected.
I would like to see more information about Target&rsquo;s API efforts, which I think they could do without giving away business intelligence, but overall I support the line they are walking with their API efforts. To me, Target is making a statement that they have an API, and if you are "Target employees and trusted third parties", you can get more access--it is a start, so I'm hopeful.
I'm part of many private API discussions lately, where I&rsquo;m trying to educate companies about the benefits of being more public, and I think we&rsquo;ll see more companies take targets approach to publishing their developer API portal in coming years.
My only hope is that more of them will also share a blog, and other details about what they are up to, and hopefully some day even some publicly available APIs providing access to information that is already available on their website.

One of the API news story of the day was the release of the Hacker News API. I&rsquo;m only lightly interested in the fact that HN now has an API because, honestly I don't feel like an API at this point in the evolution of tech curation site is something to applaud, but their approach to making their API real-time I think does subtly reflect other currents in the API space.
HN partnered with Firebase to make sure the tech news curation site doesn't just have an API, it has a real-time API. Meaning you can now get HN links in machine readable way, so that you can build the popular flow of tech information into other web, and mobile applications&mdash;in real-time! HN launching an API&hellip;yawn! HN launch an API with Firebase bkked in, reflects a growing trend from influential APIs. For me this is more about real-time and Firebase, than it is about HN.
You see other API providers like Nest from Google baking in real-time frameworks into their APIs. Real-time isn&rsquo;t something every type of API should be considering as a default feature, but there are definitely areas where the real-time flow of data is not just a nice to have, it is essential to demonstrating the value of APIs. In my experience, I would say that there are several sectors like news, financial, Internet of Things where I'm seeing real-time being present as a fundamental ingredient for the API platform--something I will be keeping an eye on.
As I said before, some of the trends I&rsquo;m tracking on are quickly moving from trend to being baked into APIs, going beyond just the release of web APis, and adding additional layers that developers are demanding to deliver the features their end-users are demanding.

			<p><em>06 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I've been a big proponent of APIs in the federal government, and it makes me really happy to see Developer.Trade.Gov using APIs.json to provide an inventory of APIs available at the federal agency dedicated to strengthening "the competitiveness of U.S. industry, promotes trade and investment, and ensures fair trade through the rigorous enforcement of our trade laws and agreements".
If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with APIs.json, it is the open format that 3Scale and API Evangelist are working on to help make APIs discoverable. You can see APIs.json in action at the open source API search engine APIs.io, where the International Trade Administration (ITA) has submitted their APIs.json file for inclusion. ITA is the first of many federal agencies I will get to adopt the APIs.json format, and help make their valuable API resources much more discoverable, and ultimately more consumable.
Can you imagine a future where all global trade is machine readable by default, and there are millions of simple, discoverable APIs available to help stimulate, as well as regulate industry? A future where the Department of Commerce and other relevant agencies are at the center, with the highest quality APIs you can imagine, and the healthiest outreach to not just industry, but also individual business owners.
Trade.gov&rsquo;s impressive entry into the world of APIs with Developer.Trade.gov, their quick responses to feedback, and the publishing of an APIs.json file for the agency, makes me optimistic for this vision of the API economy. If our federal government can do it, then I think industries can follow the lead, ensure that the future of trade and commerce is more real-time, transparent, and accessible to everyone.

			<h3><a href="/2014/10/06/i-updated-my-apis-to-use-swagger-2-0/">I Updated My APIs To Use Swagger 2.0</a></h3>
			<p><em>06 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>I spent some time this weekend updating a handful of my APIs to the new Swagger 2.0 API definition format. I was already using an older version of Swagger, so the migration wasn&rsquo;t too difficult. I have about five new APIs I want to roll out over the next couple weeks, and I wanted them to up to date, using the latest version, so moving forward my knowledge using my existing APIs was the best way to prepare. I moved forward the five "core APIs", as I call them, analysis, APIs, building blocks, curated, and tools, to all use Swagger 2.0. These APIs provide access to my monitoring system I use to keep track of the space. I also migrated two of my "stack APIs", image manipulation, and screen capture, which are designed to be general purpose, utility APIs &nbsp;I use across my platform. To support the migration I wrote a Swagger manager for my API monitoring system, which I use to track on 2794 APIs, from 3215 companies, which API Evangelist is one of these companies. Using this new tool I imported my old Swagger 1.2 versions, and after a little touching up in my new editor, I published brand spank&rsquo;n new Swagger 2.0 definitions for all seven my APIs. The process reminded me of how API definitions really can help you describe, see, understand and ultimately communicate the API surface area you posses. I&rsquo;m going to take this and apply it to a couple of business sectors I&rsquo;m tracking on as part of my API Stack, and see what the process does for me there. After that I&rsquo;m going to get to work on the next five APIs I&rsquo;m designing, and see how Swagger 2.0 contributes to my design of brand new APIs, as well as later on in the life cycle. I'm using my Swagger API definitions as a central truth for driving server side code, and my documentation. I&rsquo;m eager to...[<a href="/2014/10/06/i-updated-my-apis-to-use-swagger-2-0/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>06 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>As I hear stories of the HP separation today, I'm reminded of how companies of all shapes and sizes interact, both historically, and in this potentially new API driven business landscape we find ourselves in. I&rsquo;m not an expert in running any size company, but this won&rsquo;t stop me from being a pundit on the subject! ;-) The HP story brought me back to a conversation I was having the other day with a VC, regarding what is next for Apigee, and when I said IPO, the VC asked me if maybe SAP would buy them. I know that SAP and Apigee are partnering, but honestly I don't know jack about Apigee&rsquo;s business model, or even SAP, so I really don't have a clue what is next, I can only guess. The conversation did prompt me to create this Evernote (birth of any API Evangelist blog post), helping me flush out some of my thoughts on how companies could potentially work together in an API driven business environment. I know that one way that big companies get the talent and market share they need is through the acquisition of smaller companies, something that has worked well for some time. However, another aspect to this history that only rarely gets discussed, is how many people, and brands just disappear into these acquisitions&mdash;never to be seen or heard from again (until their next start-up of course). I&rsquo;m not inferring that big companies shouldn't acquire little companies. The point I'd like to make, is that maybe larger companies should consider how they could be a little more interoperable, and achieve numerous loosely couple relationships, versus always just acquiring a company. You never know, you maybe get all of the benefits of a relationship, without the negative of bringing a start-up in house only to see it chewed up by your internal bureaucracy&mdash;you know it happens! I see plenty of large multinational corporations working through subsidiaries, shell companies, and...[<a href="/2014/10/06/divorces-mergers-and-acquisitions-in-the-api-economy/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>05 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve been a outspoken advocate for more open source API management tooling, for some time now. I'm sensitive to the fact that startups have to make money in the API space, but in my opinion a certain layer of the API space needs to remain open and interoperable for this all to work, and I feel that open source tools are an important variable in this equation. When I last checked into what was available in the space, there really wasn't much, so in 2014 I figured I'd take another look. Originally there is just one player on the space who was completely open source, and that is WSO2: API management is just one tool in the massive open source catalog that WSO2 brings to the table. The company provides a number of open source tools including identity &amp; authentication, ESB, data and API management solutions. WSO2 is the shining open source example in the space currently, and I was very happy to see them emerge on the landscape. I feel WSO2 plays a strong role in the API space, but their approach to open source is the enterprise version, where the open gets rid of software licensing cost (yay), but is targeted specifically at an enterprise audience. I&rsquo;m not the enterprise, so to compliment what they bring to the table, I&rsquo;m also looking for a different version of &ldquo;community&rdquo;, and eager to see smaller players step up as well. After WSO2 I got a taste of open source from Alcatel Lucent, with their release of API Grove, which was a whole other definition of open source: API Grove was open sourced late in 2012 by Alcatel Lucent, holding some promise that another strong enterprise open source player would step up, but within months it would be clear that it was not a live open source offering, but Alcatel abandoning their API program, and publishing as open source to get the press release.

			<p><em>03 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>
The home page of API Evangelist has always been my API 101 page, where any new visitor can land, not know a thing about APIs, read the page, and walk away understanding at least what an API is, and hopefully also a greater understanding of how it impacts their world. From the beginning the API Evangelist home page always had a lean toward API providers, and over time I've added information about consuming APIs, as well as trends in the API space I'm seeing.
In my opinion my 101 content has become too lengthy, and not properly onboarding people to the multiple areas of APIs like providing APIs vs consuming APIs. I think it is time to overhaul my 101 section, and produce some newer, more relevant API 101 content for 2014. To support this, I'm working on a series of 15 API 101 segments, with each one having a story version, as well as a slideshow edition, complete with audio.&nbsp;
I finished the first one, which is my 100K view, API 101 introduction. I'm still working on the slideshow version. Once I'm done I"ll move on to providing APIs, and as I finish each one I'll hang on the homepage, as well as publish out via the blog, and Twitterz.

			<p><em>02 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m giving my hypermedia API research a little love today, and as part of this I was reviewing examples of hypermedia in the wild like with the Elastic Path Cortex API. Elastic Path was the first company to introduce me to the possibilities around hypermedia way back in 2011, so I enjoy checking in regularly to see what they are up to with their APIs. As of January 2014 I&rsquo;ve committed more time to doing research on hypermedia APIs, as well as work to tell stories about how hypermedia is being applied by companies, in a way that anyone can understand. This last summer at API-Craft in Detroit, the hypermedia community acknowledged that they have an image problem, and had some significant work ahead of them when it comes to storytelling, specifically around speaking to the &ldquo;normals&rdquo;. Personally, I don&rsquo;t 100% speak hypermedia-eze, but I know with some practice I can get better at translating. I also know that some of the hypermedia folks aren&rsquo;t so good at speaking plain english to normal people, but with some practice I htink they will also get better. To help me in my jouney I figured I&rsquo;d translate what Elastic Path has written on their Cortex API page, but first I want to acknowledge the image they have--which is the first sophisticated hypermedia visual I&rsquo;ve seen, and I want to work on creating more like it. Let&rsquo;s get on with the translation from hypermedia-eze to plain english. Elastic Path starts with: Cortex is a mediation layer that uses patent-pending dynamic linking technology to discover and assemble resources from multiple business platforms into one consistent interface. Data and services from enterprise applications like Commerce Engine, Adobe&reg; Experience Manager, OpenText&reg; CEM, and others are mapped to Cortex using a lightweight schema. Once abstracted, these resources &mdash; from any source &mdash; are linked together to generate Cortex Business APIs that securely project your unified services to the world.

			<p><em>02 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>
As the popularity of APIs rapidly increases, I&rsquo;m seeing spreadsheets play a growing role in both providing APIs, as well as consuming APIs. On the road to #APIStrat Chicago I came across a company who has a pretty dead-simple approach to using spreadsheets to drive data via APIs, called Data Everywhere.
Data Everywhere describes their service:
Select the cells in your existing spreadsheet and click publish. Your data will be instantly available in other spreadsheets. Our REST API makes your data available in databases, phones, websites, and other applications.
Whether we want to admit it or not, most of the world's data is locked up in spreadsheets, and providing dead simple tools to liberate this data via APIs are a very logical solution. We aren't just talking about taking an entire spreadsheet and turning it into an API with Data Everywhere, we are seamlessly making data available from spreadsheets via API, leaving the existing workflow in tact.
Educating the &ldquo;every day &ldquo; spreadsheet user of the importance of APIs in making their work interoperable, and accessible in web and mobile is definitely a priority for me in the coming years. I feel like this education process will continue to be an important layer to my evangelism work for many years to come.
P.S. Thank you to Data Everywhere for helping moderate the data session at @APIStrat!

			<p><em>02 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>I spend many of my days talking to startups, SMB, SME, larger enterprise, institutions, and federal government folk about APIs&mdash;if you haven&rsquo;t heard, its what I do. I&rsquo;ve become the sort of counselor for the world of APIs, sometimes just listening, but often times giving advice, and sharing random thoughts with a wide variety of characters, who are looking to understand the world of APIs. One pattern I've been consistently seeing across many of these API sessions, is that questions around internal API strategy are trumping any external or public API questions. These usually discussions start with questions of API design, deployment and management, but then often times move to strategies around internal evangelism, and incentivizing the usage of APIs in general, not just consuming your own internal APIs. Many are recognizing that the path towards being a healthy API provider, involves also being a healthy API consumer&mdash;a sort of yin yang of APIs. I&rsquo;m realizing that for many of these folks that I speak with, the challenge of selling the concept of APIs internally is often a bigger, and more daunting challenge than designing, developing, managing, and evangelizing an API to partners, or even the public. I think we are underestimating the challenge our friends at larger organizations are facing when they try to get the resources they need to be successful within their own work, let alone also contribute to the overall success of their company, agency, or organization. I&rsquo;m finding that many of these conversations only occur because I do not have anything to sell them. Many of the people I talk to are starved for an educated, outside perspective, even before any desire to understand, and learning about the larger API space. If you are an API service provider in the space, this is a layer of the API economy you need to help me with. How do we onboard these folks as they come into the space, and equip them...[<a href="/2014/10/02/internal-strategy-trumping-external-api-efforts-in-many-conversations/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I was doing some research on travel and transportation APIs over the last couple of weeks, and one of the developer portals I was looking at was one of the enterprise leaders in the space, the Sabre Dev Network. I really like the overall implementation from Sabre, except for one thing...
There is no pricing page for the Sabre Dev Network. ;-( The only place you find a mention of pricing is in the FAQ page, where it says:
"We have a number of different pricing options for our services. Whether you are a company just starting out or an established travel provider, we have pricing options that will fit your business needs.&rdquo;
I understand you are a little apprehensive about sharing your pricing, or maybe you haven&rsquo;t really thought it through all the way, and just want to shake the trees and see what falls out. Whatever the reason, when it comes to APIs you should be a little more transparent about what is going on.
Additionally, as far along as you are with some of the other parts of your developer program, you should have a pretty robust service composition page, and a partner and certification framework for developers to work towards.
Other than the lack of information about what everything costs, I&rsquo;m pretty impressed with the Sabre Dev Network, as a platform. I have two other stories to do around their approach, but wanted to start with the constructive criticism before I move into the praise. ;-)

			<p><em>01 Oct 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m working through my API design stories, and was working through some research on the origins of Swagger, and as I'm writing a paragraph on Wordnik, I became distracted around how Swagger was born out of this "word" startup. You see, Wordnik presents themselves as "a new way to discover meaning", and out of this work, Swagger, "a new way to discover meaning" from APIs was born.
Words are an important building block in communication, and I see APIs as a similar, more structured way to approach online communication on the open Internet. Swagger has given us a new vocabulary, providing a new way to describe, and communicate around APIs. You can programmatically pull a a Swagger specification for an API, and within a few seconds you have an idea of what the API resources means, and has to offer.
There really isn't any major point to this story, other than the fact that I find it interesting that a company who is striving to discover meaning among words, would also be looking to help us discovery meaning of APIs. I think this essence is why so many are adopting Swagger to define their valuable API resources, because it comes from a purer place, than just trying to sell you API tooling, and is actually working to help you find and communicate the meaning amongst APIs.

			<p>Swagger is now Open API Definition Format (OADF) -- READ MORE As the API lifecycle continues to expand and comes into focus, new services are emerging to help both API providers, and consumers, better manage API operations from start to finish. New API integration services like Runscope have emerged to better understand how APIs are actually being consumed, and services like APIMatic&nbsp;are born out of the need to produce better quality SDKs for developers--it only seems natural that eventually these services would start working together. APIMatic will now generate SDKs in 7 languages that are designed, and enabled to inspect/debug all of the requests and response data between their API, and the applications that depend on them. This will provide both API provider, and consumer with vital details on the integration in real-time, that can help ensure applications integrations are all optimized. All of this is made possible because Runscope has APIs, and APIMatic was savvy enough to weave in integration, monitoring and testing capabilities directly into the SDKs of any API. APIMatic will import API definitions in WADL, Swagger, I/O Docs, API BluePrint, or Google Discovery, then generate SDKs for you in Android, Windows, iOS, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Node.js, complete with Runscope integration, monitoring and testing! Something made possible because you have a machine readable API definition for all of your APIs. This latest expansion of the API lifecycle I feel was kicked off by Swagger, introducing the ability to generate interactive docs, server and client code for your APIs. This was then expanded upon by Apiary.io by allowing you to mockup APIs using API Blueprint, and now APIMatic and Runscope are expanding the lifecycle to include SDKs and API monitoring. It makes me happy to see the API definition continue to play such an important role, as the central truth in the API lifecycle, enabling all of these API services along the way. Someday I'll create a cool little lifecycle visualization...[<a href="/2014/10/01/autogenerate-runscopepowered-api-sdks-using-apimatic/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m dedicating more time lately to research how APIs are being used at universities, and a couple months back I published my first white paper on using APIs in higher education. As I do with other sectors, I would like to shed light on how APIs are being used at universities, and potentially share best practices, and stories between higher educational institutions, amplifying the positive effects of APIs. My efforts are beginning to pay off, and I was recently contacted by two friends, Mark Morvant (@MarkMorvant) and Adam Croom (@acroom), at the University of Oklahoma. They had seen my&nbsp;University research, and read my white paper, but what really lit their fire was the piece in the NY Times about student-built apps teaching colleges a thing or two&mdash;after reading that, they decided to give me a call to discuss APIs more. I started with the two approaches to using APIs that I am seeing at universities: API Access To Institutional Resources - APIs being deployed to provide better access to data, content, and other digital resources across campus, allowing integration with internal or external systems, and across campus web and mobile applications. Using Public APIs On Campus - Putting APIs from the public space, like Twitter and Google Maps to use in classrooms, and even in administrative operations, allowing for the better access to information, and seamless integration with existing campus workflows. Then I discussed the different approaches to introducing APis on campus that I've come across so far: Top-down IT Lead APIs - School executives take the initiative to make APIs a mandate across all campus operations, acknowledging the benefits APIs can deliver. Middle-in Faculty Lead APIs - API efforts led by teachers and other faculty, taking advantage of APIs in their daily work, and hopefully also in the classroom. Bottom-up Student Lead APIs - The kids today get online technology, and encouraging them to use APIs in all aspect of their learning will only...[<a href="/2014/09/30/where-do-we-start-with-apis-at-the-university-of-oklahoma/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Sep 2014</em></p>
			<p>I get asked about hiring developer advocates, and API developers quite often during the week, but this specific question in my inbox from Augmate, I found more interesting. I thought their usage of a &ldquo;modern API developer&rdquo; was a little different, which gave me a reason to provide some fresh thought on the subject. After reading the question, my first response was going to be: API developer for consuming APIs or providing API? A thought which I immediately nullified, because any &ldquo;modern API developer&rdquo; is both. You should never just consume APIs, or just develop APIs, you should always do both&mdash;something that will give you the healthy perspective that I would be looking for when hiring. Next, there is the matter of which programming language they should be fluent in. I'll leave it to you to test for skills and knowledge that is relevant to your technology stack. Having been a director of IT, and development team manager, the requirements are always different in each environment I've worked in&mdash;I won't pretend there is one HR process to rule them all. You know your environment and needs, and you should develop a line of interview questions that reflects your objectives. In addition to your regular line of questioning, I would suggest that you also want someone who is language curious, and has played around with many of the popular languages, and not just stuck in one discipline like enterprise (C# &amp; Java), web (PHP, Python, Ruby, JS), mobile (Obj-C), and even someone who plays around with leading edge approaches using Node.js, Scala, and Go. You want to make sure they are proficient in the languages and technologies that speak to your core operations, but someone who is also aware of what is going elsewhere in the landscape&mdash;making for much more of a pragmatic developer, and reducing dogma to healthier levels. Beyond the code I&rsquo;m also looking for signs that a developer is well read, and communicative,...[<a href="/2014/09/30/what-i-would-look-for-when-hiring-a-modern-api-developer/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Those of us who live and breathe the API space, throw around a phrase, &ldquo;The API Economy&rdquo;, quite a lot. Referring to the increased usage of APIs across vital industries to drive web and mobile applications, but we as we do often, the phrase is used to describe the future of things, rather than where things actually are. While we are seeing APIs begin to affect global economies, we really don't have much hard evidence that "The API Economy" is a thing beyond our own techno fascination. With the release of a new report from the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), called Digital Trade in the U.S. and Global Economies, us API geeks are getting the first actual evidence of "The API Economy", with a section in the report called "Increasing Collaboration and Integration in Online Services&mdash;The Economic Contributions of Application Programming Interfaces". The USITC reached out to me several months back, and interviewed me as part of the work on the report, and this week I finally got to see the resulting work. The report is the second of two compiled by committee, with the first report, Digital Trade in the U.S. and Global Economies, Part 1 published last year. The earlier report laid the groundwork for the second report by providing an overview of trends in U.S. digital trade, describing the ways digital trade facilitates trade in other sectors, and approaches for estimating the economic impact of digital trade on the U.S. economy. Now with Digital Trade in the U.S. and Global Economies, Part 2 the commission is focusing on the value of U.S. digital trade and the potential growth of this trade, providing insight into the broader linkages and contributions of digital trade to the U.S. economy (aka API economy). The report that includes a survey of U.S. firms in industries particularly involved in digital trade, also examines the effects of notable barriers and impediments to digital trade, and presents case studies...[<a href="/2014/09/30/the-u-s-international-trade-commission-includes-apis-in-latest-report/">Read More</a>]</p>

We just wrapped up the 4th edition of @APIStrat in Chicago last week, and once again I&rsquo;m very happy with the way things went, as 400+ folks gathered to discuss APIs. The event had the right tone, and I got the usual flood of comments from attendees, speakers, and sponsors about what a great experience the event was.
I would love to take credit, but all of the responsibility goes to 3Scale for making it happen. 3Scale takes all the risk, and their rockstar team makes the event a reality&mdash;I just help get folks to the conference, contribute ideas to the schedule, present, and MC as much of the event as I possibly can.
@APIStrat has been helping move forward the conversation in the API space for two years now, starting with New York and San Francisco in 2013, and now Amsterdam and Chicago in 2014, all made possible because of 3Scale's investment.

The number one priority for 3Scale, when it comes to @APIStrat, is to move the conversation forward, while investing in the API community. This is why the event is a success, setting the tone for the conversation amongst sponsors, speakers, and attendees. I&rsquo;m thankful for being able to to take part in @APIStrat, and look forward to digesting all of the videos from Chicago, which are already on YouTube.
We&rsquo;ve already announced that the next @APIStrat will be in Berlin, spring 2015, and we are accepting input on where it should for the fall of 2015. Let me know if there are any topics you&rsquo;d like to see discussed at @APIStrat 2015, and we'll see about getting your ideas into the lineup.

Only a small percentage of these stories ever make it to my business of API analysis site apievangelist.com, or my politics of APIs analysis at apivoice.com. Over the summer, this got me thinking, and while wandering around Detroit after API-Craft Detroit this last July, Steve Willmott (@njyx) and I were talking about the rapidly expanding API space, and both felt there was a gap in the news reporting for the API sector. ProgrammableWeb&nbsp;(PW)&nbsp;does a good job of providing API news and analysis for the space, but because of my monitoring of the space, I know there is a lot more news that never sees the light of day. Steve and I both aggreed that PW is the tip of the API news iceberg, and while API Evangelist, and API Voice provide some added analysis, there was no straight news site that showcased all of the news across the thousands of companies doing interesting things in 2014. Beyone PW,&nbsp;APIScene and API Codex are aggregating stories from across the blogosphere, providing access to the best stories across the blogosphere, but still do not reflect the wealth of stories I see being published by both API providers, and consumers. Out of this conversation, the API.Report was born. The API.Report is a Github Pages hosted API news site, that anyone can post short, concise blog posts that are no more than 500 words, with supporting links to additional sources of information.

The description Clarify provides on their docs page is pretty concise: The Clarify API provides a RESTful API to extract knowledge from audio and video content Why is Clarify popping up on my list lately? There are a number of things that will cause an API related company to show up on my radar, but Clarify has several things going for it lately: Branding Shift - Recently they migrated from being Op3nVoice, which I didn&rsquo;t think wasn't that hard to spell, but I know that many people would have trouble with, to being Clarify&mdash;which is a cleaner brand. Hypermedia - Clarify is an extremely well designed API which employs HAL, and hypermedia JSON format for al API responses. SDK Writing Guide - They provide an SDK writing guide for anyone looking to develop SDKs for Clarify, making sure they are consistent from language to language. Story on Helper Libraries - Clarify produced a great blog post called "SPOIL your Users with Great Helper Libraries", which I added to my curation, and stories around API management. I&rsquo;m tracking on 15 separate APIs as part of my voice API research, and 18 as part of my video API research. These are fast growing spaces, and the problem of delivering indexable meta data alongside audio video is only going to increase, something startups like Clarify is looking to provide an API driven solution for. Now that @APIStrat in Chicago is over, I'm going to take the video from the conference, and run through Clarify, to get a feel for how the API works, and see first-hand the value it adds to my existing audio and video content.

My contribution will be from my history of APIs, and my API trends material, helping people understand the how we got here, and some thoughts on where we are going. History of APIs As I continue to make sense of the API space, I'm evolving my history of APIs story, adding and consolidating areas that I think have significantly contributed to the overall growth of the API space. While I track on 100+ categories, or business sectors, in which I think APIs are being applied in some interesting ways, I feel these seven areas are the cornerstones of the app, and its underlying API economy. Commerce - Beginning with API pioneers like Salesforce, eBay, and Amazon to payment leaders like Stripe, and Paypal. Social - Teach us how to share, interact in collaborate with Deliciious, Facebook, and Twitter, to more recently Google+. Cloud - Amazon forever chagned how we will use APIs, enabling us to go beyond hobby, and actually deploy global infrastructure using web APis. Geo - Google Maps brought the resources web and mobile developers would need, and Census, MapBox, and others are pushing forward a valulable stack of geo API resources. Media - Flickr brought the businesses of APis into the mainstream consciousness, and Instgram, YouTube, and others stream rich media into our worlds via APIs. Messaging - Twilio, Sendgrid, and other messaging APIs provide valuable resources for developers, and also show the rest of us API providers how to manage and evangelize your APIs right. While there are definitely other valuable API resources that are contributing to the success of the space, these six areas represent the bedrock of the app, and API economy.

			<p><em>19 Sep 2014</em></p>
			<p>I'm seeing the enterprise wake up to the potential of an API centric approach to doing business, slowly evolving beyond a Service Oriented Architectural (SOA) approach, and trying to understand why APIs are superior for delivering resources to the web, mobile, and Internet of thing (Iot) apps they are delivering, and increasingly depending on. Even though we are clearly in an enterprise phase of the API evolution, I&rsquo;m watching many leading enterprise entities struggle with their early API efforts, producing some pretty weak solutions, that developers are not finding useful, and hurting their efforts right out of the gate. I know that many enterprise API architects will dismiss my advice, because they know better than I do, but I feel compelled to share my thoughts, in hopes that even a handful will be more successful with their API efforts, which I think will also help the overall space as well. When embarking on your API journey, you are going to be handicapped right out of the gate, because as a large enterprise organization, you do not have many of the essential characteristics necessary in your DNA to be successful with APIs, but this is why it will require an API journey, to reprogram your DNA, and better operate on the open Internet. Before you start planning your APIs, and the supporting developer area, you need to play with other public APIs, to better understand what makes APIs different. I am always amazed at how many enterprise API architects that I engage with, when I ask them what public APIs they have used, admit that they have never used one. They just have heard of many of the common APIs out there, so to prime the API pump, let&rsquo;s hack on a couple of the most popular API solutions out there: Twitter - Hacking on the Twitter API provides some very important lessons when it comes to API design, as well as developer support.

			<p><em>19 Sep 2014</em></p>
			<p>The machine readable API definition format Swagger, just rolled over to version 2.0. I use Swagger to describe all of my APIs, and I largely associate the creator of Swagger, Wordnik for kicking off this latest renaissance in defining APIs in a way that provides us with a machine readable vocabulary to talk about all of these valuable resoures that we are exposing via APIs. There are other formats out there, older ones like WADL, and more recent ones like API Blueprint, and RAML, but Swagger was the one that revived this movement, helping us create ways for generating important elements throughout the API lifecycle, from mock interfaces in the design process, to testing and monitoring of product APIs. Honestly, I don't much of the details of what has changed from version 1.0 to 2.0, except that with version 2.0 you can use YAML to describe your API, just like competitor RAML, or markdown as with API Blueprint. The common assumption is that by using YAML and Markdown, even non-programmers will be able to communicate around APIs without having to navigate JSON&mdash;something I'm not entirely sold on, but will keeping looking for signs of in the wild When it comes to the rubber meeting the road, I think Swagger has an advantage because of the amount of adoption, and the tooling available in the community. Swagger has a pretty significant lead when it comes to language libraries, both server and client side, as well as converters, and other integration tooling you will need. There are some areas like an API design editor, where Swagger has been playing catch-up, but overall the community has a pretty significant lead from my vantage point. I&rsquo;m working to convert all of my Swagger files from version 1.3 to 2.0, then I'm sure I will have more thoughts about the latest version, once I get down into the weeds, but for now I&rsquo;m just happy to see the focus Wordnik...[<a href="/2014/09/19/machine-readable-api-definition-format-swagger-matures-to-2-0/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Sep 2014</em></p>
			<p>I'm preparing for a talk at the The Smart Grid Interoperability Panel Second Annual Conference, in Nashville Tennessee, specifically participating on a panel titled "Using Power Grid Open Data Initiatives". I accepted the request to go speak as part of my wider work on the Green Button iniative out of The White House, DOE, NIST, and the GSA. I was asked to provide some thoughts on how to help move the Green Button efforts forward earlier this winter, and again in the spring, and just haven't had the bandwidth to give any energy, so I saw this as a great opportunity to make some time as part of this panel. In May, The White House, 18F, some Presidential Innovation Fellows, and myself were asked to move the Green Button ball forward, resulting in a new website, and developer area that is all hosted on Github. I'm bummed I wasn't able to make time to participate, but now I have been able to go through the new site, and developer area, and gather my thoughts on where we could go next with the effort. Before we get started, lets start with the basics, what is Green Button? Nick Sinai (@NickSinai), Deputy Chief Technology Officer of the United States, puts it this way: Green Button is a policy idea. It's the notion that customers &ndash; residential, commercial, industrial, and yes, government customers of energy &ndash; ought to get access to their own energy data, in a standard digital format. The Administration has articulated this several times, in a number of Administration energy, climate, and smart grid policy documents. The government is a big customer of energy, and we deserve our own energy usage and price data. Green Button is also a public-private initiative, in response to a 2011 White House call to action. The White House, DOE, NIST, and GSA have been collaborating with the utility and tech industries on this growing effort for a few years...[<a href="/2014/09/17/how-do-we-continue-moving-green-button-data-and-apis-forward/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 Sep 2014</em></p>
			<p>The conversation around open data and APIs in government is dominated by talk of making resources available to the public, which is a good thing, but is only 1/3 of the discussion that should be occurring amongst gov-focused techies, as well as the project owners, and data stewards who are managing these vital public resources across federal agencies. APIs are not just deployed to support public access to resources, this has just been the trend that is getting all the headlines, and there is still lot of value to be realized when putting APIs to work within an agency, opening up access to data, content, and other digital resources, increasing efficiency agency-wide using Internet technology. The best example of this in action is out of the private sector from Amazon, and the story of the important role internal APIs have played in the company's success, across internal operations, but also in the public as a commerce, and a cloud computing leader. To help you relate to the idea of an internal API, think of all the times you've had to ask IT for access to something from a database, like a list of facility locations, government programs, or maybe an employee directory. You have to find out where the source of these resources are, track down the right contact information, then put in a request to get a copy of the data or content you are looking for. Often times even once you get the data dump, it could be the wrong information, or missing what you are needing, requiring you to go back, yet again, to get what you are looking for--not very efficient, and also extremely frustrating. Access To The Resources You Need When you open up data or content via an API, despite common belief, you aren't necessarily making the information available to anyone on the open Internet, you are just using Internet technology to make it accessible.

			<p>I am working on a white paper for a big enterprise provider who is looking to deliver solutions in the API space. At their request I&rsquo;ve gone through six industries and looked for companies who have over 5k employees and are doing interesting things with APIs--a request that produced some great research for the white paper, as well as for stories here on API Evangelist. It can be hard to find large enterprise organizations who are doing full blown "API", because honestly many of them just do not get it yet. Sure I can find many that are doing web services, and dabbling with APIs, but it can be downright difficult to find examples of companies that I would showcase as a healthy API patterns. Doing this research I was looking more for examples of anything &ldquo;API&rdquo; happening, any bare-bones, positive signals that could be emulated, and try and demonstrate what huge opportunities there are in these industries, for anyone who could do it right. I got my first draft ready, and submitted for review, and jumped on a call to discuss. Everything looked great in the paper, except senior leadership said there was a lack of detail demonstrating how developers were building applications on these enterprise public APIs, They would need more hard examples of how these large company APIs were being used, how this benefited the API provider, and some hard numbers of usage, revenue, showing how business models, products and services were being developed. After smiling, I told them I could guarantee that most of these providers themselves don't have that detail, and are still working to figure this out. Your request is exactly why we do APIs, and begin to establish an external R&amp;D lab for providing answers, in realtime. Even if some of the more mature providers have this information, I can guarantee they aren't going to share it publicly. Maybe if they were a startup, this type of sharing...[<a href="/2014/09/14/can-you-show-me-the-roi-on-all-of-this-api-stuff-before-we-commit/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I used to work hard to write blog posts on API Evangelist that would have broad appeal with the Hacker News community, and at first I didn't have any luck, after trying to engage with readers on posts, I found myself blacklisted, where nothing I submitted showed up. I lived in some kind parallel universe, all because I argued with a couple influential HN users, who didn't like what I had to offer. I started a new account for API Evangelist, and began playing the game with a little different approach. I didn't engage with users, and wrote posts with titles that would bring in readers, kept things short and superficial, and had some front-page exposure, which would result in thousands of pageviews, and then would dissipate. This type of storytelling ever really turned into meaningful traffic, an engaged audience, conversations, or brought any value to my overall mission. Early last year I stopped posting to HN, only occasionally posted a story, but never really used it in the same way that I had before. I was worried my traffic would be hurt, but I went back to work, trying to write meaningful posts, that brought value to my target audience, and supported my mission. In the last year and a half, I've seen my sustained monthly traffic go from 500 page views a day to almost 2000 a day, all by just my sticking to my mission. The audience that does visit my blog, for the most part engages with me, shares posts on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and other channels, and I see much of what I write echoed on other blogs, and in conversations I see on social media, and in person at events.

			<p>Swagger is now Open API Definition Format (OADF) -- READ MORE In 2014 we are making significant progress in deploying APIs in support of city operations, but we still have so much more work ahead of us when it comes to making public resources available. You can find a dedicated developer area full of data sets, and APIs, in most major US cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and many more, but what else can we do to really pick up the momentum and quality? Standardizing API Design Practices APIs are not that difficult to design with the right education, and experience. Developers who work on city contracts, or are employed by the city should all be taught common web API design practices, and be exposed to modern API design tooling like Swagger and Apiary. Even with this type of education, there will still be many differences between city deployments based upon needs, and tactics, but a little training could go a long way to make city operations more streamlined. Open Solutions For API DeploymentThere are a lot of common approaches to delivering city services, which means there should also a be a number of ways to provide standardized, open solutions for deploying APIs that support city operations. There should be a wealth of open source, Wordpress like solutions for deploying APIs in support of government operations. Sometimes connecting to legacy systems is just to much work, and deploying a simple, standalone solution, then syncing using data dumps or directly with backbend system might be more fruitful. Common API Management VisionI&rsquo;m pretty impressed with the standard approach to deploying city developer areas, and delivering data sets, and APIs, but in reality this is the result of the hard work of Socrata, one of the API management providers dedicated to the government space.

			<p><em>11 Sep 2014</em></p>
			<p>I saw another story about whether or not public APIs are going away, which is another story in a fairly long line of stories I&rsquo;m seeing lately from enterprise outlets about whether or not the demise of Netflix, ESPN, and now Aetna means public APIs are a bad idea, unsustainable and now will be going away&mdash;proving enterprise API architects right that an SOA is the way to go. If you are looking at the bigger API picture, the answer to this question is clearly no. Amazon, Salesforce, Twilio, and many other public APIs with straightforward business models are doing just fine. Just because a handful of companies who never quite had a business model, and never really gave their API efforts &nbsp;the resources they needed to be successful, doesn't mean that public APIs are a bad idea. Looking through my list of 2500+ APIs I track on, I can point to numerous other APIs that are about to shutter, which has nothing to do with the fact that they are public, and everything to do with not having the right business and political building blocks for their API. I&rsquo;m sorry if you are just in the game to exploit developers and get them to build things for your company, you can&rsquo;t be exploitative in this game and last, developers smell that shit a mile away--you have to give, just as much as receive. To be successful when it comes to APIs, you can't just launch an API, spend 100K on a popular API management solution, hire one guy (you know it, you hired a guy), and expect miracles within a couple months. It just doesn't work that way. APIs take a lot more grassroots building of an evangelist team, investment in a lot of projects, telling of many meaningful stories, and going to many conferences, Meetups, and events before anyone will know you exist, let alone building anything on your APIs.

			<p>
I&rsquo;ve talked about how the open source API search engine APIs.io can be deployed as an internal API search engine, as well as for public API discovery in the past. One aspect of this approach that I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough, is that the search engine doesn&rsquo;t just return APIs in the search results, it can provide access to supporting building blocks as well.
The APIs.json format doesn't just provide a machine readable way to describe, and index your APIs, it also provides a way to describe the building blocks that support your APIs like code samples, SDKs, and other things API consumers will need when putting APIs to work for them.
The indexing of these API support elements really starts to benefit company operations when you also bundle tools for non-developers alongside internal APIs, like spreadsheet connectors, d3.js visualizations built on top of APIs, and other elements that any user can reverse engineer, or just put to work immediately--no configuration necessary.
Imagine if your internal staff could access any digital resources across the company, similar to what Amazon has done internally, and not just find the API driven resources they need, but also the tools they need to apply them in their jobs. This is where APIs started getting really powerful, allowing anyone at your company to put APIs to work and get their jobs done in a self-service way, with a limited amount of IT resources required.

			<p>I get a lot of folks who engage me about the API space, most of them are API providers, many are focused on API consumption, with only just a small few are looking the evangelism and analyst side of things. As far as I know I&rsquo;m the only individual out there looking at all industries, across all of these areas, working hard to understand how APIs are being applied across the board. I&rsquo;m always keeping an eye out for talent that is also working to expand their knowledge in the same way, but as the API universe expands I think this is going to be increasingly difficult, and I think we are going to start needing more analysts who focus within specific domains, and business sectors. With this in mind, I&rsquo;ve been closely watching Mark Silverberg (@skram) over at SocialHealthInsights.com, and is what I&rsquo;d considered to be an API expert when it comes to the convergence of healthcare and APIs. Mark is always hacking on interesting things related to healthcare, and pushing the envelope when it comes to healthcare APIs, by not just hacking on healthcare APIs, but also developing apps for Google Glass. Mark has developed his expertise in a similar way as I do, by hacking, telling stories, and consulting--which I think is the best way to develop yourself as an API expert. Earlier this spring the FDA was preparing their new developer area, including the release of a handful of APIs like the drug labeling and adverse effects APis, and a handful of us with DC connections that were on the backchannel, providing feedback for the FDA during this beta period. Unfortunately I was too busy traveling to participate, but Mark was front and center providing some serious feedback on the API, resulting data, and the overall approach by the FDA.

			<p>One question I get pretty frequently from my readers, is about how they should explain APIs to their senior leaders, specifically the non-tech savvy executives. In my opinion, these conversations can be some of the most important ones, not just for a single company, but potentially an entire industry. To help support this effort, I&rsquo;m working through several stories that anyone can put to work when trying to convince their senior leaders that APIs are a thing--this week is about access to resources. APIs are all about making vital company resources available in a self-service, and secure way over the open Internet. Despite popular belief, most APIs are not publicly available, just the overview, documentation, code samples, and other building blocks are publicly available. If a developer actually wants to use an API they have to register, and be given access to API endpoints, before they can do anything with them. There are some pretty&nbsp;proven approaches to API management&nbsp;out there, which include a centrally located developer center, simple API registration form, and potentially multiple service levels, that all help manage how APIs are accessed and put to use. API resources can be anything from a company directory, to details of specific projects, or possible access to company compute, storage and other common IT resources. Anything you do on your computer at work, or have published via your website, can be made available via APIs, and easily accessed through a public or private portal, in a 24/7, self-service manner--all without needing to make a request for IT resources. This type of efficiency is what every company needs to be competitive in coming years, ensuring that every employee has access to the resources they need to get their job done. Access to corporate or organization resources via APIs doesn&rsquo;t have to be something just for programmers. It is pretty likely that you already have web services at your company, but these APIs have been designed just for...[<a href="/2014/09/10/explaining-apis-to-senior-leadership-access-to-company-resources-without-the-it-hassle/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>When I think about the concept "API mashup", It conjures up visions of clever hacks using Twitter and Google Maps from 2008 or 2009, where savvy developers would find innovative ways to mashup two or more APIs, and deliver some sort of web, and eventually mobile application on top of a couple of common APIs. In 2014 I think the concept of a mashup has evolved, and while the term has fallen out of popularity with some people, I think the topic is still extremely relevant, and is something I want to discuss more at @APIStrat in Chicago at the end of this month. To continue this discussion we've asked four leaders from the world of APIs to join me on stage for a panel discussion we are calling &ldquo;The Next Generation API Stack&rdquo;: Issac Roth (@ijroth) of&nbsp;StrongLoop Kyle Wild (@dorkitude) of&nbsp;Keen.io Antony Falco (@antonyfalco) of&nbsp;Orchestrate.io Mehdi Medjaoui (@medjawii) of&nbsp;oAuth.io Justin Karneges (@jkarneges) of Fanout.io I want to discuss the concept of &ldquo;mashup&rdquo; which I think historically has represented what we do in the world of APIs, but is a term that has significantly moved on for experienced API developers. I&rsquo;m looking to discuss this from a client side perspective, but also from the API provider, API aggregator, and analystics perspective as well. When you look at what innovators like StrongLoop, Keen.io, Orchestrate, and Webshell are doing, it is much more than just mashing up two APIs and building a web app. Today's tools allow you to quickly mashup multiple APIs into new API stacks, bringing together your own resources, as well as those of other API providers, and deliver an intelligent stack of resources that any web, mobile, or Itnernet of things developer can use to build apps. Another thing that has evolved is the number of APIs being used, based only upon my own usage, my apps have gone using 2-3 APIs in 2009, to using potentially 20-30 APIs in a single app&mdash;dramatically...[<a href="/2014/09/08/a-conversation-with-ijroth-dorkitude-antonyfalco-and-medjawii-in-the-next-generation-api-stack-panel-apistrat/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>There was a very interesting piece from venture capitalist Albert Wenger (@albertwenger) of Union Square Ventures over the labor day weekend, called Labor Day: Right to an API Key (Algorithmic Organizing),&nbsp;that I&rsquo;ve had open ever since and wanted to take a moment to add my thoughts to. First let me say, I agree 100% with Albert&rsquo;s post, but I felt that the piece left out some very critical elements, which I think Albert simply left out because he was just trying to get a short thought published over a holiday weekend, but I feel pretty strongly these points are critical to his argument, and should be put out there. You can read the full post over on Albert's blog, but I think this statement sums it up nicely: There is a simple and universal regulatory change that would dramatically shift the bargaining power: an individual right to an API Key. By this I mean a key that would give an enduser *full* read/write access to the system including every action or screen the enduser can take or see on the web site or application. Alternatively one could think of this as an individual right to be represented by an algorithm. Shortly after Albert published his post, his partner Fred Wilson (@fredwilson) chimed in with his own post, called Algorithmic Organizing,&nbsp;and again I took just single paragraph that I think sums it up: I believe that in the long run these platforms may/will be replaced by blockchain based networks of labor where there is no platform middleman and there would be no need for a legal right to an API because all the data would be public by default. I agree with what both Albert and Fred are saying, and it makes me happy to see such prominent VC firms seeing the future in this way. What I wish to add to this conversation is some critical thought around the the business and political building blocks...[<a href="/2014/09/06/api-evangelist-thoughts-on-the-right-to-an-api-key-and-algorithmic-organizing/">Read More</a>]</p>

First APIs are just like websites, but instead of being for humans they are meant for other desktop, web, server, and mobile applications. When you go to twitter.com you get an HTML listing of tweets, and when you go to api.twitter.com you get back JSON which is meant for other application to read, where the HTML is meant to make visible for the human API--that is it, that is the difference. I use Twitter in this example, but APIs can be used to deliver any data, content, or even programmatic resource like say an image resize or convert a Word document to a PDF file. APIs act just like web or mobile applications, and let you read, update, add, or delete any of these resources that have been made available via an API. When having this conversation, make sure and remind your leadership of the years between 1995 and 2000, when we were trying to convince our leadership that we should have websites. Remember all that selling we had to do to convince leadership that our company should have a website? Is there any question about whether or not your company should have a website in 2014? NO! This is the same thing that is going on with APIs between 2010 and 2015, and by 2015 to 2020, if your company doesn't have an API you will be at a serioius disadvantage. To get started, any data or content that you have on your website should be available via an API. This helps you easily make things like company directory, product and service...[<a href="/2014/09/04/explaining-apis-to-your-senior-leadership/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>03 Sep 2014</em></p>
			<p>In my work everyday as the API Evangelist, I get to have some very interesting conversations, with a wide variety of folks, about how they are using APIs, as well as brainstorming other ways they can approach their API strategy allowing them to be more effective. One of the things that keep me going in this space is this diversity. One day I&rsquo;m looking at Developer.Trade.Gov for the Department of Commerce, the next talking to WordPress about APIs for 60 million websites, and then I&rsquo;m talking with the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints about the Family Search API, which is actively gathering, preserving, and sharing genealogical records from around the world. I&rsquo;m so lucky I get to speak with all of these folks about the benefits, and perils of APIs, helping them think through their approach to opening up their valuable resources using APIs. The process is nourishing for me because I get to speak to such a diverse number of implementations, push my understanding of what is possible with APIs, while also sharpening my critical eye, understanding of where APIs can help, or where they can possibly go wrong. Personally, I find a couple of things very intriguing about the Family Search API story: Mapping the worlds genealogical history using a publicly available API &mdash; Going Big!! Potential from participation by not just big partners, but the long tail of genealogical geeks Transparency, openness, and collaboration shining through as the solution beyond just the technology The mission driven focus of the API overlapping with my obsession for API evangelism intrigues and scares me Have existing developer area, APIs, and seemingly necessary building blocks but failed to achieve a platform level I&rsquo;m open to talking with anyone about their startup, SMB, enterprise, organizational, institutional, or government API, always leaving open a 15 minute slot to hear a good story, which turned into more than an hour of discussion with the Family Search...[<a href="/2014/09/03/an-api-evangelism-strategy-to-map-the-global-family-tree/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I get quite a few nice comments about my blog(s) behind the scenes. Many are from the enterprise or insttutions, where I know I could never get away with publishing publicly. As the APi space has heated up in 2014, more people are trying to make sense of this API mayhem, and ultimately they come across my blog, and find &nbsp;valuable information that really helps them in their journey.
I have been considering adding a page, listing some of the kind words I get from folks--maybe I will someday, but today I received a nice email, one I couldn't help but ask if I could repost--so here is a nice message from Saswat Anand:

Hi
I have been reading your blogs and following you on Twitter for a couple of weeks now. I am a researcher in the Stanford&nbsp;University. By following your blogs and twits, I have been trying to understand the problems and opportunities in the API space.
I just wanted to drop a quick note to thank you for being a true evangelist for API's. I find your blogs very interesting both because of valuable information and your writing style.
Thanks,
Saswat

I can't lie, the number one reason I do API Evangelist is for me, but the number two reason is to help folks like Saswat make sense of the space. I don't care whether you are a researcher in higher education, startup founder, or work at a government agency, I want you to understand APIs.
I couldn't be more stoked in my career right now, and be happier with what I'm doing. I was a little concerned if I had made the right decision to start API Evangelist back in 2010 and 2011, but in 2014, it has turned into some pretty meaningful work for me.
Thanks Saswat! Glad you find it valuable.

			<p><em>28 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I never properly wrapped up my experience at API-Craft last month, where I moderated a pretty important panel discussion on hypermedia with Mike Amundsen (@mamund), Mike Kelly (@mikekelly85) Steve Klabnik (@steveklabnik), Kevin Swiber (@kevinswiber), J&oslash;rn Wildt (@JornWildt), and Markus Lanthaler (@MarkusLanthaler).&nbsp;
The discussion was pretty amazing, I will let you watch for yourself. The action actually starts right at about 30:00 minute mark, so there is a lot of dead space until then.&nbsp;
  Broadcast live streaming video on Ustream
&nbsp;
Careful it is 3 hours of some pretty geeky talk, you might experience some hypermedia side effects. Seriously though, this is a pretty important video discussion about a very relevant, and often misunderstood part of API evolution. I highly recommend watching.
I'm just getting back down to this time period in my Evernote stack, so look for some more stories out of API Craft and hypermedia after rewatching this talk. Also stay tuned for upcoming stories from I Love APIs in San Francisco, #API360 Summit in Washington DC, and of course @APIStrat in Chicago at the end of September.

			<p><em>28 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I am making another pass through 821 companies doing interesting things with APIs, and flagging a handful of them as inactive. I will then attempt to contact each of the companies to see if anyone is home. All signs point to a handful of them being dormant projects, with silent blogs, twitter accounts, and other common streams you normally see flowing from API platforms.
If any of them are indeed shutting down, I&rsquo;m going to urge them to consider open sourcing as much of their API platform as they can, from server side, and client side code to API definitions. At the very least I would like to capture a snapshot of the API, the title, description, image, and a machine readable Swagger spec of the interface, to help record the pattern for future consideration.
I&rsquo;m sure some of these APIs will have investors they will have to consult before they can do something like open sourcing their API, and I&rsquo;m sure many of them won&rsquo;t even respond&mdash;I know how difficult it is after you have to put your startup down. Regardless I will at least flag them, make an attempt to contact, and if they don&rsquo;t respond I&rsquo;ll queue them up for profiling, and build an archive of abandoned API.
In forty years I&rsquo;ll be that old crazy guy in the neighborhood who has piles and piles of old APIs laying around his yard. ;-)  These damn things will be worth a fortune some day!!
Seriously, if you have an API that you are planning to deprecate, please reach out, I'd be happy to help archive it for the history books.

			<p><em>28 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m needing to quantify the work i do around APIs in higher education for a university in the U.K., so I figured I&rsquo;d craft into a story that I can share with my readers, and potentially other schools who would ask what it is that I do. I am interested in APIs in higher education because I feel strongly that our institutions are a fertile environment for ensuring that the next generation of our society possess the digital literacy they will need to navigate and find success in our increasingly digital world. When I mention that higher education institutions should be incorporating APIs into daily operations, most folks immediately think of a very technical, IT directed effort, which is one layer to the discussion that should be considered, but ultimately it is about developing an awareness, and engagement by administration, faculty, and the students with the increasingly public APIs that surround us, as well as internal institutional APIs. Our personal, and business lives are moving into the cloud. We are increasingly dependent on web-based and mobile applications in many aspects of our lives, and a growing number of these software services have APIs, and API-enabled actions that can be taken by anyone, even non-developers. My mission as the API Evangelist is to help everyone be aware that APIs exist, and that they are there to assist you in your personal and business life. Which brings me back to higher education institutions being an important place to expose students, and faculty to the benefits of APIs&mdash;in preparation for the increasingly API driven world unfolding around us. While I pay attention to over a 100 categories of APIs, let&rsquo;s take one area, photos and images, and use as a backdrop for what I do. I pay attention to over 25 photo and image APIs that provide image related services for developers, as well as direct access to the popular photo and image platforms we often depend on...[<a href="/2014/08/28/explaining-my-work-around-apis-in-higher-education-to-institutions/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>When it comes to APIs, the quickest way to get an API for your company, organization or government agency is to choose to only use online services that have APIs. Twitter, Facebook, Google, Dropbox, Github, Instagram, Flickr, and many other popular services you already use, all have APIs. As I&rsquo;m expanding on my tracking of API deployment tools, to include deploying APIs via Google Spreadsheets, and to scraping data from websites, I can&rsquo;t help but step back and consider truly what is the easiest way to deploy an API, which really is about choosing to use online services that already have an API--no connecting to your backend systems necessary! We talk about APIs in the context of developers, using APIs to build applications for end-users, and provide system integrations. What if we talked about it in context of the users, and helping individual users aggregate their APIs into a single, personal API stack? As Joe or Jane user, I could have my own personal API hub, with code samples, and other resources to understand how to access my APIs. I&rsquo;m not sure how oAuth would be triggered in this scenario (needs more thought), if a developer wanted access to my Facebook or other private data, but if I ran WordPress, and included my Flickr photos in my API stack, API access could be pretty straightforward. Thinking of this in the context of enabling personal API hubs is a pretty far out there concept, but understanding that you can have an isntant API just by using common services that have APIs, is pretty powerful. In reality, the average person will rarely ever need a personal developer hub with a stack of APIs, but if we teach people that they need an API with all the service they use, so they can use services like Zapier, and the other API-enabled tools, we might just be able to keep SaaS providers honest, ensuring they always public APIs, transparency...[<a href="/2014/08/27/you-can-have-an-api-just-by-choosing-products-and-services-that-have-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking on the usage of spreadsheets in conjunction with APIs for several years now. Spreadsheets are everywhere, they are the number one data management tool in the world, and whether API developers like or not, spreadsheets will continue to collide with the API space, as both API providers, and consumers try to get things done using APIs. APIs are all about getting access to the resources you need, and spreadsheets are being used by both API providers and consumers to accomplish these goals. It makes complete sense to me that business users would be looking for solutions via spreadsheets, as they are one potential doorway to hacking for the average person&mdash;writing macros, calculations, and other dynamic features people execute within the spreadsheet. I know IT would like to think their central SQL, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and other database are where the valuable data and content assets are stored at a company, but in reality the most valuable data resources are often stored in spreadsheets across an organization. When it comes time to deploying APIs, this is the first place you should look for your datasources, resulting in Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheet to API solutions like we&rsquo;ve seen from API Spark. I&rsquo;m seeing spreadsheets used by companies to deploy APIs in some of the following ways: Microsoft Excel - Turning Microsoft Excel spreadsheets directly into APIs. by taking a spreadsheet, and generating an API is the fastest way to go from closed data resource to an API for anyone to access, even without programming experience. Google Spreadsheet - Mounting public and private Google Spreadsheets is an increasingly popular way to publish smaller datasets as APIs. Since Google Spreadsheets is web-based, it becomes very easy to use the Google Spreadsheet API to access any Spreadsheet in a Google account, then generate a web API interface that can allow for reading or writing to a spreadsheet data source via a public, or privately secured API....[<a href="/2014/08/27/using-excel-as-an-api-datasource-and-an-api-client-for-the-masses/">Read More</a>]</p>

Enterprise social API Jive Software wins for the best developer landing page. Normally I tell folks, like I did with Trade.gov last week, that your landing page should have a short, precise description of what you API does&mdash;this is some seriously valuable real estate, and you have one chance to make an impression.
I would put Jive Software into the category of more making a first impression, than providing a short description of what the API does:

I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this approach for every API provider, but if you can do it right, and make a solid first impression&mdash;run with it! As an API Evangelist, and IPA Evangelist, I can seriously get behind a message like &ldquo;brew up something awesome&rdquo;. +1
I like how they have apps, docs, APIs, and IPAs as taps, and the taps even work when you mouseover!  Seriously, all of this API shit is hard to make entertaining (trust me I know), and when you can provide this human touches while inciting innovation, they can go a long way in breaking the ice with consumers.
Right above the taps Jive Software provides the essential getting started, and register links for their APIs, which signals that beyond the fun facade, they mean business, and want to help you onboard with using their APIs. I haven&rsquo;t dug deep into the Jive Software API to see what else is going on, but after this first impression it is likely I will be looking around more, now that they made a good first impression.

			<p><em>26 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>Containers are a fast growing trend when it comes to delivering compute resources online. Reflecting the world of API design, I feel containers are about deploying exactly the cloud resources you will need to complete a specific compute objective, then putting everything into a single virtualized container definition, that can be forked, clone, scaled, and evolved indpendently of any other resources. Each individual container posesses everything it will need from the operating system, file system, database, necessary libraries, and APIs to accomplish its given objective. Virtual containers will make API driven resources even more agile, nimble and scalable--not just for providers, but also for consumers. Everything we have right now I would consider to be a retail API market&mdash;where even though APIs are often sold B2B, they are generally a one-size fits all API solution. Think about when API resources become modular, customizable, scalable, wholesale resources that can be bought and sold, and deployed anywhere, making all digital assets into commodities that are ready for use anywhere in the API economy. My goal is to understand how APIs and containers work together, and as I do with all of my research I setup a Github repo for tracking every piece of container news I read that I feel is relevant, each company doing interesting things containers, tools for working with containers, and ultimately my analysis. Cloud computing will continue to be the lead driver of innovation in the API space, and I feel the introduction of cloud computing in 2006&ndash;2008 gave legitimacy to web APIs&mdash;you could now deploy global infrastructure using web APIs, game on. I think containerization will take API design, deployment, management and integration to the next phase, and closer the early visions of a programmable web we all started envisioning around 2005. I will be taking each of my API designs, and developing an Amazon Machine Image, Heroku App version, as well as a docker container definition.

			<p><em>26 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I have been doing a lot of research into the world of financial APIs, specifically looking at some of the larger companies providing APIs that deliver market news, data, corporate profiles, and other data that make markets go round.
As I consider some of the common building blocks that are common across many financial API--real-time data frameworks, and visualization tools are two of the top items that I think will be part of every financial API stack in the future. Almost every API I looked at had some sort of real-time stream, promising data faster, as well as a way to extract meaning from these streams using template, or custom visualizations.
I&rsquo;m tracking on real-time API services and tools, and i&rsquo;ve been seeing some of these frameworks, like Firebase getting baked in by default to some API platforms. I am also tracking on visualization tools, I just don&rsquo;t have the research published as a Github repository yet, like I do with my real-time research.
I will keep tracking on API providers who are doing interesting things with real-time or visualizations, and hopefully be able to publish more examples. I can&rsquo;t help but think there are some pretty interesting opportunities for open frameworks, and white label solutions for API providers when it comes to real-time, and visualization layers on top of their existing APIs.

			<p><em>26 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I was keeping an eye out for interesting API stories on ProductHunt the other day and came across an cool notification startup that lives in the Stripe API ecosystem, called Hooked.
Hooked allows users to set up notifications for any events related to a Stripe account. Hooked uses the Stripe API to disocver events, and then employs webhooks to send notifications.
As I'm writing this story, I realize this is very similar to my previous story today about real-time and visualization layers for APIs, and that notifications could easily be provided as a white label solution for API providers, giving them a ready to go notification layer to their APIs.
Right now I lump notifications in my research under real-time, but I think I will be pulling it out into its own research area. Notifications are real-time, but they are more messaging than just a real-time feature, but they are kind of more real-time than just a message too. Does that make sense?
We'll see. That is the fun of my API Evangelist research network, is that all of it is pretty liquid&mdash;allowing me to keep moving things around until they make sense in my head.

			<p><em>26 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
My friend Mark Silverberg (@skram), pointed out a very cool API the other day, that geolocates zip codes, and appropriately named&nbsp;ZipLocate. What I really like about ZipLocate is that they do one thing, and they do it well. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong I love me some AWS and Twilio, who have industrial grade APIs, but I also have a love for simple, lightweight APIs that focus on one thing.
Another interesting thing about ZipLocate is that it is always free, and never rate limited. He says that it is relatively cheap to host the API, because bandwidth usage is light, with all API calls are heavily cached. I like this type of micro service design--I want thousands more just like it.
What I also dig about ZipLocate is that if you &ldquo;...don't trust the API to be around tomorrow? Host it yourself. Source code and data import scripts available on Github&rdquo;. This is possible because the ZipLocate API is open source, and the data comes from the Census Bureau. This approach to developing dead simple APIs on top of government data is really important, and I personally feel that all 6,482 data sets across 22 federal agencies who have published their data.json file, should have APIs just like ZipLocate.
It looks like ZipLocate is a project developed by Nathan Cahill (@nathancahill). I like his style, and think his approach is simple, elegant, yet extremely powerful, and provides a blueprint that others can follow when designing, developing and deploying APIs built on top of public data.

			<p><em>26 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I have been slowly producing my own stack of APIs, which I'm putting under The API Stack brand. My goal with each of these APIs is to do one thing, and do it well, then package up the server side code, API definition, and publish as its own standalone Github repository.&nbsp;
I have an Evernote full of ideas for APIs, and I'm seeing plenty of great API designs that I could easily emulate from the rest of The API Stack. As I have time, I will deploy each of my API designs as an API Stack API, eventually looking to build a robust stack of utility APIs.
To support this I've separate out my APIs here into two separate pages, my core APIs, which will provide access to content across the API Evangelist network, and my stack APIs which will all be the modular, API Stack designs.&nbsp;
When I'm done deploying any new design, and I feel it is ready for primetime, I will list here for every to check out and play with.

			<p><em>25 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I was looking around the Google Developer area as part of some regular work, and I noticed an interesting page Google has under their mapping session, that help users decide which API they need&nbsp;based upon their goals.
As the page says: "The API picker lists the most common things you may want to do on a map or with location-based data, and suggests the API that most suits your needs. For details about each API, follow the links to the related documentation."

&nbsp;
I don't think that the table layout Google uses is a particularly good one, resulting in a pretty busy looking matrix. I don't think it is a perfect solution, but I like the idea of providing developers with some sort of assistance in understand which API to use, based upon their goals.
This is something that a larger API provider would probably do, but a simple little needs calculator that could help users translate what they are looking for into what the API does, is an interesting concept to play with for some API providers.

			<p>As I&rsquo;m riding the build up for APIStrat in Chicago, and preparing for I Love APIs in San Francisco, and the API 360 Summit in DC, I can&rsquo;t help but think about how busy the API event scene is getting&mdash;in 2014 there are 14 separate conferences focused on the world of APIs. In the beginning there was just Gluecon, Defrag, and the Business of APIs, then 3Scale and API Evangelist got together and started planning for @APIStrat, then immediately API Days happened, Nordic APIs came on the scene, API-Crafta&nbsp; grew beyond just Meetup, and before you know we have 14 separate events. I&rsquo;m going to be biased here, because @APIStrat is my baby, and I&rsquo;ve been involved in supporting API Days since day, so these two events will always have a special place in my heart. Even with this I believe in interoperability in the community and I am working to support all of the events equally, so if you are organizing make sure and reach out. You can find me at I Love APIs in a couple weeks in San Francisco, as well as at API 360 in Washington DC the same week, and of course @APIStrat in Chicago at the end of September, and Nordic APIs in October. Unfortunately we messed up in planning @APIStrat, and made it at the same time as REST Fest, which seriously pissed me off&mdash;so I won&rsquo;t be attending REST Fest yet again this year. :-( This is part of the reason I'm putting together this research, so I don't make this mistake again. As with the rest of my work, I setup a Github repo, and website to give me a single place to aggregate information on API events. I will do my best keep up to date, for my own education, but I am also looking to help you understand each of the events, the organizers, sponsors, speakers, and also who is attending.

Electronic search engine APIs Octopart developed a pretty slick Microsoft Excel plugin for their API a while  back, and have now taken it to the next level, with a Google Spreadsheet connector for their API. You can find a simple video on on their site, and the code on Github.
Using the open source Google Spreadsheet API connector, you can connect to the latest electronic parts pricing and availability in your Google Docs, kept up-to-date using the Octopart API&mdash;providing a pretty interesting way to maintain a bill of materials (BOM), across multiple providers.
Octopart's approach to using both Microsoft Excel, and Google Spreadsheets as an interface for the average business person is pretty interesting, not because it is the perfect technological solution, but because it brings the value of APIs closer to the actual business problem owners.
Octopart helped increase my awareness of spreadsheets being in conjunction with APIs, but after seeing other providers like Twilio using Google Spreadsheet for storing SMS, and the increased usage of API reciprocity providers like Zapier, making me think spreadsheets have quite a future in the API space.
What innovative uses of Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets are you seeing in conjunction with common, or even unique APIs?

			<p><em>25 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I am super stoked to announce that we have Andrew Nacin (@nacin), the lead developer from WordPress keynoting API Strategy &amp; Practice in Chicago next month. We are looking to continue the conversation around an official WordPress API, scheduled for inclusion in the WordPress 4.1 release.
While an API for WordPress may not seem like anything that big, when you think about it being baked into WordPress by default, it means that over 60 million websites will potentially get an API, and 22% of the top 10 million websites run WordPress&mdash;a pretty significant shift.
WordPress is still taking feedback on their upcoming API release, and you can visit their website and participate there, and now you can also come to Chicago the end of September, and hear Andrew talk about his work at WordPress, and participate in the convversation around the WordPress API afterwards in the halls.
Make sure and get registered soon, you only have 4 weeks left before we all come together for @APIStrat in Chicago.

			<p><em>23 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>The new Heroku Button gets us one step closer to a new age of API deployment, where anyone can deploy the APIs they need without any developer or IT resources. As I&rsquo;m working on packaging up API designs for my screen capture API, and image manipulation API, this type of approach is what I&rsquo;m envisioning for all of my APIs in the future&mdash;push button API deployment. You shouldn't have to wait to deploy the API you need. Just as we are beginning to deploy pre-packaged application stacks like Wordpress, and Drupal, we should be able to deploy common API deployments for images, blogs, videos, and much, much more, with a single click of a button. Once any new API is launched it can be configured, and connected to other systems using the API, allowing it to operate as part of larger stack, or stay as completely independent node &nbsp;that just checks in with the mother ship from time to time. While there will remain a handful of API leaders like Twilio and SendGrid who will have a big presence, many of the APIs in this next wave of API deployment will be smaller, and more transient in nature, taking advantage of current cloud trends around PaaS, and containerization. This new type of APis will possess a self contained blueprint for the OS, database, server-side code, API definition, and even configuration, integration, and automation tooling for the API. I&rsquo;m working on Docker definitions for creen capture&nbsp;andimage manipulation AP, as well as other APIs I develop in the future, but first I think any API I deisn shouldl run as a Heroku app, that anyone can deploy in their own account with a single click of a button. It won't take much work to make this happen for any API I deploy, and since 3Scale API infrastructure, which I use to secure my APIs, already runs on Heroku--making securing, and managing my Heroku deployed APis seamless.

			<p>The other night I was writing about the need for a social media directory API, like the one the GSA has launched for the federal government, but specifically for the City of Chicago. I was trying to get a list of each of the City of Chicago Twitter accounts, and while I&rsquo;m glad there is a central social media account list, I always want an API so I can eliminate the need for data entry. After I posted my story, Oliver Seiler (@0seiler) emailed me the API endpoint for the New Zealand Government Directory API, which doesn't include the social media information that our federal government social media directory API delivers, but offers another look at what one possible pattern for government directory APIs is. This is one of the by-products of&nbsp;my profiling of federal government APIs, that I will begin to see API patterns that ALL government possess, things like a directory API. There should be a WordPress of the government directory API, a open source PHP Web API, possessing a common API definition, allowing any government agency, of any level, to be able to quickly download and deploy a directory API for their branch of government. I&rsquo;m hoping when I&rsquo;m done with my profiling of 120 federal government APIs, I'll have better suggestions of which APIs patterns government agencies should be offering by default. I will also have API definitions for all of these government API patterns, which I can probably pretty quickly crank out server side API code to support&mdash;who knows maybe Wordpress 4.1 will be available by then and I can use Wordpress as an API deployment framework. Until then I will just start tracking on all the common patterns for government API deployment, and publish as stories her on API Evangelist, and on my federal government research site. I'm thinking other things I'm tracking on, like API deployment using containers, and deployment via PaaS platforms like Heroku, will contribute to...[<a href="/2014/08/22/wordpress-style-api-modules-for-government/">Read More</a>]</p>

I stumbled across a cool resource out of Heroku today, their HTTP API design guide, which intends to direct practices for API design on the Heroku API platform.
Heroku&rsquo;s goals around APIs design are, "consistency and focusing on business logic while avoiding design bikeshedding&rdquo;.  They put out the guide to drive consistent aPI design practices at Heroku, but are also interested in sharing with the wider API community.
I think API design best practices are something every API provider should have, and publish publicly (on Github). I think it is ok to even fork, and modify existing guides like Heroku&rsquo;s or maybe from 18F out of federal government. This most important thing is that you have a guide that can guide your team, or other teams within your organization.
Now that I&rsquo;m seeing more of these, I will start flagging, and aggregating them so we can browse and continue learn the API design practices from the leading API providers out there.

			<p><em>21 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>In my monitoring of the API space, when I started seeing a large number of blog posts, tweets, companies, and other elements I track on get tagged with the same tag over and over, I take notice. My blogging, CRM, and news curation system all have their own tag cloud interface for the week, showing which tags have been applied--so if a tag gets heavy usage, I know it. Over the last couple of years, I've spun up new research into other areas within the world of APIs, beyond my core design, deployment, management, evangelism, discovery, and integration research. I created separate buckets beyond just provide and consume to track on these new areas, called trends, opportunities, and priorities. In 2014 it is beginning to seem like each of my trend research areas are getting baked directly into API platforms, ranging from real-time features with Firebase, to reciprocity by default using Zapier. API providers are learning that having a real-time layer, or a reciprocity layer baked into their platform is a good thing, and why reinvent the wheel when you have kick ass solutions like Firebase and Zapier. It makes sense that API providers would be looking externally to deliver&nbsp;aggregation, real-time, reciprocity, and even voice layers for their API platforms--this stuff is hard, and why spread yourself too thin. Intuit just bought reciprocity provider itDuzzit, and I think we will more providers integrating Zapier into their platforms by default like Nimble did. We'll also see more API platforms bring in Firebase as a real-time layer like Nest did for their Internet of Things (Iot) thermostat API platform. Overall it seems like a white label solution that any API provider could put to use when considering solutions for aggregation, real-time, reciprocity, voice or even data solutions including spreadsheet connectors, analysis, and visualization, would do well in the space. At the very least, any company looking to step up and provide solutions in these areas, should definitely...[<a href="/2014/08/21/what-i-have-been-calling-api-trends-are-slowly-being-baked-into-api-operations/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I first wrote about openFDA back in June, showcasing the launch of their new developer area, and I'm happy to see they aren't missing a beat when it comes to launching new APIs. I recently saw that openFDA just launch a new endpoint, called the Drug Label API, which allows you to query over 60K prescriptions and over-the-counter drug labels.
It is satisfying to see such a large government agency find their API mojo. The original spark at the FDA was lit by Presidential Innovate Fellow Sean Herron (@seanherron), but most recently Sean has handed off the iniative to an internal team who will keep they platform moving forward using the same formula.

Beyond just the API, openFDA is also seriously putting the "open" in openFDA with:

Public Repo on GitHub&nbsp;
Extensive Community Q&amp;A on StackExchange
Progress Terms of Service for Government

Everything the openFDA is doing provides a great blueprint for other agencies to follow, from their creative evolution of the interactive API documentation, to encouraging other federal agencies to fork, and use the openFDA TOS in their own platforms.
The work coming out of the FDA makes me happy, because it sets a strong example that other agencies can follow, provides the rest of us with something positive that we can highlight when working to change public opinion, but also because it is such extremely vital data, and should be available in full download, and API format so that it can stimulate web and mobile app development, and system integration across the private sector.

I&rsquo;m adding PokitDok, a simple API for healthcare to The API Stack, and my overall APIs in healthcare research. Well I didn't exactly add them, PokitDok added themselves to my healthcare research by forking the Github repository, and adding themselves to the JSON data source&mdash;once I received the pull request, I accepted, and they were published on the site.
Usually once a week I spend time to manually adding new companies I've come across in my monitoring of the API space, but being a one man show I can&rsquo;t find everything across this massively expanding space. This is why I depend on you to help me curate the best from across the space. Not everyone knows that the entire API Evangelist network of 60+ research projects all runs on Github, which allows anyone to help write posts, curate industry news, and maintain the lists of API providers.
As soon as I accepted the pull request for PokitDok, I also tagged them as &ldquo;API Stack&rdquo;, which immediately adds PokitDok to The API Stack, listed under healthcare. No matter which doorway a company enters, I will make sure they get published to all appropriate research areas across the API Evangelist network, using my tagging system.
Thanks PokitDok for adding yourself, and I look forward to paying attention to the good things coming our of your API platform via your Blog, Twitter, and Github profiles.

			<p>I depend on a number of cloud services to make my personal and business world go round. Even as a programmer, who can hand code just about any script to integrate, automate, and orchestrate my world, I find myself using more reciprocity services like IFTTT and Zapier. API reciprocity providers are one of the most important evolutions of the API space, because they make the whole world of APis accessible to the normals, and not just to the geek crowd. My time is valuable, and personally I'd rather being using existing tools and services, rather than re-inventing the wheel, and when it comes to orchestrating my online life, I need all the help I can, which is why I am looking IFTTT and Zapier for help. I&rsquo;ve been using both platforms in 2014, but as I do with any other software I&rsquo;ve been dating for any sustained period, I start looking at getting a little more serious. This is where I have to part ways with IFTTT, and other other platforms that don&rsquo;t have clear relief valves for their free tier, allowing me to start paying monthly or annually for my use of their service, and sensibly scale up as my needs grow. Zapier has a pretty straightforward pricing framework, giving you just enough room to get hooked, then you can pay for more usage as needed. Having a free tier for any cloud service is essential, but having a tiered business model, and clear monetization strategy, so I know that you will be around in the future, is a requirement. I will keep my IFTT account to play with, but when it comes operating my business, continuing to integrate Zapier into my workflow makes sense as they have a clear business model that fits my needs. Plus Zapier has an API. Ummmm&hellip;hello? An API for your automation and integration layer across all the services you depend on, via their APIs--how cool is that!

			<p><em>20 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
The sharing economy is booming, and with the release of the Uber API, the attention on this space will only increase. Personally I&rsquo;m only  interested in the surface area of the API that Uber has released, and what it tells about the opportunity for API designers in the sharing economy.
I think the surface area of the Uber API is pretty minimal, but very significant when you look at it as a glimpse of what is to come, as the sharing economy gets a direct pipeline to the API economy, and the resulting app economy. Oh yeah, I went there&mdash;I used all the economy buzzwords in once sentence. Seriously, I think the five endpoints that Uber launched with, are very telling:

/products
/estimates/price
/estimates/time
/history
/me

These API endpoints represent the beginning of the shared economy API surface area, and while there will be many additions, augmentations, and different takes on what APIs look like in the sharing economy, I predict many other providers will often emulate Uber in their own design.
I&rsquo;m not really equipped to make a judgement on the value or importance of the Uber API. What I can do is keep an eye on Uber, and other sharing economy startup and their APIs, and look for patterns across each of the implementations. Hopefully the space can remain true to their roots, and make sure the API definitions are shareable, and reusable across the flourishing sharing app sapce.
Uber is focused specifically in the transportation portion of the sharing economy, and this makes me consider the bigger picture, and who will step up to serve the larger sharing economy, with an Uber API platform for the sharing economy. I think much like the wider API space, as the sharing API space matures out there will lots of opportunities for aggregation, real-time, automation, messaging, payments, and other API essentials that are in service of the sharing economy.

			<p><em>20 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking with a very nice recruiter over at Google over the last couple weeks, and she has been so kind in keeping me updated about opportunities for evangelism at Google. This is the 3rd round of talks I've had with Google while being the API Evangelist, talks that historically go nowhere because of their programming test, which is a super silly aspect of their HR process. I was straight up with the Google recruiter a couple of weeks ago when she first emailed me, and again when we talked on the phone last week&mdash;I do not take programming tests to open up doors for employment conversations, sorry. ;-( It is a waste of my time, and yours, and doesn&rsquo;t measure shit. I understand that you have to qualify large number of folks, at your very algorithmic-centric company, but when it comes to measuring what I do, a programming test isn&rsquo;t a thing. If programming a tic-tac-toe game on a live screen share is what you need to open up a conversation with professionals around evangelizing your platform, you need to look elsewhere. Nowhere in my role as the API Evangelist do I have to code under time pressure with someone else watching, sorry. I would even say, having hacker skills, trumps programming skills in a public facing evangelism role, and speed, quality of code go out the window. This is about making connections through hacker storytelling, something that doesn't always pencil out to producing best code, and is more about helping people understand what is possible using a platform, in the most meaningful way&mdash;requiring more focus on the person and their problems, not the code or algorthm. I&rsquo;ve managed to have man very meaningful conversations with other tech giants like Intel, IBM, large institutions like UC Berkeley, BYU, and establish fruitful relationships with partners like 3Scale and API Spark, and across federal agencies like Department of Education, Energy, NASA, and the White House...[<a href="/2014/08/20/sorry-google-your-programming-test-is-not-a-valid-measurement-of-my-skills/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
If you follow Twilio blog or Twitter account you can always find a good API story from the API leader. It also makes me happy to see trends I&rsquo;m seeing from other provider re-enforced by the API heavyweight. This time is providing spreadsheet integration with common API resources, like Twilio SMS.
Twilio has a pretty slick tool they call TwilioSheet that allows you to receive SMS messages in a Google Spreadsheet, and created a pretty nice walkthrough of the entire setup. Providing this type of functionality helps, as Twilio says, "make it easy for developers and non-developers alike to receive SMS messages in a Google Spreadsheet&rdquo;&mdash;emphasis on the non-developers.
Whether we like it or not, the spreadsheet is the #1 database solution in the world, and provide a huge opportunity when it comes to bridging the world of APIs with the wider business landscape. This is something that API reciprocity providers like Zapier have bridging for a while now, and something that API providers like Intuit are looking to bank into their API platforms.
When you see Twilio doing something like providing providing spreadsheet integration for their API platform, you have to stop and consider whether or not it is something that might work for your own API platform. Spreadsheet integration by default with API your driven resources is a great way to expand the reach of any API, bringing these valuable resources within reach of the actual, everyday problem owners.

			<p><em>20 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
It can be hard to keep up with what the latest geek trends are--where all of the latest digital watering holes are&nbsp;(especially when your old), that allow you to find the latest info, conversations, and links to everything cool and hip. I depend on my network of API peeps for tips, and last week I was introduced to a new place that I wanted to pass on to you, called Product Hunt.
Product Hunt does a good job of describing what they do:
Product Hunt surfaces the best new products, every day. It's a place for product-loving enthusiasts to share and geek out about the latest mobile apps, websites, hardware projects, and tech creations.
I&rsquo;ve had the site open for the last five days, scanning for cool tech creations that grab my attention, and when I opened the tab today, I noticed that APIs dominated the top of the list.

You see the Uber API (of course), and Zapier both jockeying for top slots, as well as Product Hunts API too. Product Hunt allows you to post product name, tagline, and url for any web, mobile or single page app&mdash;a format that is perfect for publishing and sharing your individual API resource creations.
I&rsquo;m going to be adding Product Hunt as an API Evangelism building block, publishing my own API creations, as well as encouraging my API readers to do the same. The platform seems like a great way to show off your API, and generate buzz (or not) around each API resource we bring to the table.

			<p><em>19 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>One of the interoperability, automation, and reciprocity providers I track on itDuzzit has been acquired by the accounting platform Intuit. Usually acquisitions are just news, and not worthy of analysis here on API Evangelist, but I feel the itDuzzit acquisition is a significant sign when it comes to API providers, consumers, and reciprocity providers. I&rsquo;ve been seeing more API providers offer IFTTT or Zapier integration as a default option, in their own developer hubs. I think the Intuit acquisition of itDuzzit reflects this evolution in how APIs are deployed, and consumed, something that has been pushed forward by this new generation of API reciprocity providers. The Intuit announcement recognizes that this new breed of reciprocity providers have the potential to reach beyond a core developer audience by: The itDuzzit technology allows multiple audiences to create sophisticated integrations with very little coding required. With their technology combined with the range of QuickBooks platform services we already offer, the breadth and depth of integrations our partners can build will grow tremendously. itDuzzit&rsquo;s sophisticated rules-based engine really set them apart from the competition, and their technology benefits the entire QuickBooks Online ecosystem: third-party developers, accountants and small businesses. The world of accounting seems like a great place to start when providing interoperability, automation, and reciprocity tools that are not just developers, but also empower end-users to use API. If you are as advanced as Zapier, even your reciprocity layer will have an API that developers&nbsp;can&nbsp;put to use when taking advantage of the cross platform API integration and automation possibilities. I will keep an eye on the Intuit partner Platform, and see what they end up doing with itDuzzit. According to the press release, "The Intuit and itDuzzit teams are already collaborating to fold the technology into the Intuit Partner Platform&rdquo;, and hopefully we&rsquo;ll see some interesting API reciprocity patterns that I can highlight here on API Evangelist, and other API providers can follow when considering their own reciprocity...[<a href="/2014/08/19/providing-users-with-reciprocity-tools-so-important-intuit-purchases-itduzzit/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>19 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>The Bing Developer Center team has released a pretty interesting pluginthat assist developers who use Visual Studio when building web or mobile applications using APIs. In an effort to make developers lives easier, the Bing Developer Assistant now comes with integrated API code search that, &ldquo;while coding, a relevant code snippet related to your current API will be automatically displayed in the IntelliSense window which is powered by Bing Code Search". "Code snippets are short piece of code that you can easily learn and copy", and you can "copy the code, or click the source URL to view where the code snippet comes from, or click "Search More" to find more code samples related to the API". Which seems like it could easily be extended to other aspects of the API, using APIs.json url type, allowing for the discovery of videos, how-to, and other supporting API resources. The approach by the Bing Developer Center team&nbsp;reflects what I&rsquo;m seeing from Salesforce, Google, and other API IDE integrations. I&rsquo;m interested in continuing to explore what role API definitions like Swagger, API Blueprint, and RAML will play when it comes to API discovery via popular IDEs like Visual Studio. I also envision APIs.json also taking a lead role when it comes to discovering new APIs, or pulling from a curated list of existing APIs, while programming within any IDE. There will also be an opportunity for IT, and development support staff to discovery API resources using API search engines like APIs.io, and then create their own internal APIs.json collection of sanctioned API resources from across public, partner and internal sources. IDE API integration isn't something that will just be for the big players like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google. As more API providers publish machine readable API definitions, complete with APIs.json indexes of these resources--we&rsquo;ll begin to see more niche IDE developers who are curating meaningful stacks of API resources from a variety of sources into a single, rich...[<a href="/2014/08/19/bing-developer-assistant-for-visual-studio-delivers-relevant-api-code/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
I had someone ask me the other day if I had any numbers on how many APIs are used in a modern web or mobile applications--great question! I often refer to the growth in the number of APIs we use, but this is really just anecdotal, and not based on any real facts.
In August, as part of the&nbsp;lead up to&nbsp;@APIStrat&nbsp;I am spending more time reaching out to dev shops in Chicago, with the most recent talks with Bryson Pouw at Blaze Portfolio, and Dave Devitt at SYDCON. In future conversation I will make sure and ask the dev shops how many APIs they use in the average app they deliver.
If you have any data on the average number of APIs used in web or mobile apps at your agency, or know of research or stories that talk about this, please let me know.  Until now, many of the numbers being reported in the API space are coming from providers, I think we need to start gathering, tracking on, and reporting on API usage from the API consumption side of the coin.

			<p>Swagger is now Open API Definition Format (OADF) -- READ MORE

APIs.json was designed to be a versatile API discovery format, not just a format for public API discovery via search engines like APIs.io. An APIs.json is meant to be a machine readable index of APIs within a single developer hub, providing information on the API endpoints as well as any other supporting resources--there is no reason that all of this can&rsquo;t also be applied in a private setting.
APIs.json can easily be placed within a domain, subdomain, or at any network address, and be used to describe an internal collection of API resources, as well as bring in outside APIs. APIs.jsonbui excels at aggregating multiple, potentially disparate APIs, into a single coherent collection for use in development.
Using internal APIs.json files, a company, organization or governent agency can deploy an instance of an open source API search engine like APIs.io, or develop a custom API search tool that can aggregate the different APIs.json from each location, into a company wide API search and discovery destination.
An APIs.json provides a framework for referencing each APIs machine readable definition in Swagger, API Blueprint or RAML format, as well as other resources that internal developers will need to be successful, such as authentication info, SDKs, terms of service, and the multitude of other building blocks.
If you have public APIs, it will be a no brainer for you to generate machine readable API definitions for your APIs, and add them to a single, or potentially multiple APIs.json files for indexing. Even if you don&rsquo;t have public APis, you can put APIs.json to work improving your internal API discovery, while also opening up your API resources to the other benefits of having machine readable API definitions.Updated November 27, 2015: Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (READ MORE)

			<p><em>18 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I used to publish out a list of curated stories each week, and a listing of the top 25 APIs I was paying attention to during my regular monitoring of the API space to a site I called The API Stack. When i went to Washington DC last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, I suspended that weekly ritual, and never picked up after my world got back to normal.
I&rsquo;m still monitoring about 1000 companies, with over 2000 total APIs, and curating the stories--I just don&rsquo;t take the time each week to publish them to The API Stack. In an effort to try and reboot the project, provide value to the API Evangelist network, as well as to you my loayal reader, I've republished a new reflection of my work at the Github project. Right now it just lists 819 of the companies who are doing interesting things with APis in 114 categories.
Over the next couple weeks I will be reviewing each of these 819 companies APIs, and as I validate them, I will publish more detail. You can search for General Services Administration (GSA), under the Federal Stack to see an example of this work in action. I link to each of the GSA APIs, across multiple domains, and include a machine readable API definition as well as interactive documentation generated from the definition.
The API Stack will continue to be a window into my API targeting and monitoring, and I will update regularly as I have time. I&rsquo;m a firm believer that going forward, the API space needs to focus on the quality of APIs, and not just the number of APIs available, and The API Stack reflects this way of thinking, playing out in my own work.

			<p><em>18 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>I recently talked with Bryson Pouw (@bpouw), Founder / CEO at&nbsp;Blaze Portfolio Systems in Chicago about how his portfolio management and trading technology company sees the world of APIs. Last week I had talked with Dave Devitt (@sydcon), President at SYDCON, a web development shop, and this week I was very interested to hear Bryson&rsquo;s view on APIs, because his company is a little more niche, focusing specifically on the needs of the investment professional. Atom Align, the Blaze Portfolio Systems flagship product is looking to help investment professionals better manage their portfolios, and a big enabler of this is the Atom Align API,&nbsp;which provides programmatic access to: Information Queries &ndash; Obtain the list of portfolios, orders, brokers, and securities Trade Orders &ndash; Place, execute, cancel, and allocate trade orders Manage Trade Extracts &ndash; Create and download trade extract file The Atom Align API is only made available to trusted Blaze Portfolio partners and clients upon request, while also being used internally to drive system integrations. This approach to API design, as the core for specialty, or even widely available web and mobile applications, is the signature of a software development shop that has evolved and realized that a core API stack is essential for internal, as well as external integrations&mdash;APIs aren&rsquo;t just for public consumption when it comes to todays dev shop operations. Beyond their own internal Atom Align API, Blaze Portfolio also uses several other financial related APIs as part of their core operations. APIs are core to the Atom Align secret sauce, aggregating, refining, and making sense of markets by pulling data and content from multiple API sources, most notably financial data from Xignite. You can&rsquo;t be an investment professional in 2014 without having the right technology in your toolbox, and Blaze Portfolio has done well aggregating financial data from public API sources, into tje tool the pros are needing.

			<p>
I spend a lot of time looking for good quality logos to represent the companies I track on and write stories about. I have a certain vision in my head about how I want company listings and detail pages to look across the API Evangelist network&mdash;something that takes a lot of work.
To support this vision, I spend a lot of time looking for logos. Sometimes you can find them in the header of a website, but often times they are poor quality, not configured to be standalone, or difficult to get at for any number of other reasons--making my work a lot tougher.
I published a new list of 819 companies who are doing interesting things with APIs that I call&nbsp;The API Stack. After publishing the project, Concur, one of the travel API providers&nbsp;listed, tweeted at me asking if I could replace their logo with a better quality one from their official logo page--I did so very quickly!
I sure love me a good logo and branding page for an API. It makes my life easier, by giving me a single place to go get high quality logos, without having to open up my image editor. I wish that more API platforms would have a well designed logo page like Concur.

			<p><em>15 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>I wrote about&nbsp;What Is An API First Strategy? Adding Some Dimensions To This New Question the other day after talking with 18F. One of the commonets on the post was&nbsp;from my friend Logan Powell (@logantpowell), and I think it was so good, that it deserves its own post. I will let Logan do the talking: To supplement the pool of meaning here, I would like to add that an API-first strategy is one where the API serves as both a pattern of an enterprises IT architecture as well as catalyst for engagement. In a nutshell, an API-first strategy is a systems paradigm shift -- from a centralized, engineered mechanical system made up of subordinate parts serving as means to deliberately designed ends -- to a decentralized, organic and evolving ecosystem where the individual actors can be spontaneously enfranchised or co-opted by any other actor / set of actors to serve new purposes. This allows the system to be more flexible, respond more quickly and behave more dynamically to suit unforeseen purposes. I believe the API-first paradigm is thereby more scalable by nature. Prudent separation of information from presentation through APIs should be the first and next step for most organizations with large IT infrastructures. To be more specific, this provides a number of efficiency benefits. To just name a few: by modulating infrastructure with solid APIs, stakeholders can create / hack together production-ready applications faster, more securely and more reliably. This approach warrants a new form of IT team protocol wherein the curation of APIs is front-and-center to their role. When designing a new product / service, the design of it's API should be commensurate. As the product or service makes it's way to production, making sure the API is well documented, easy to use / as conventional as possible, hooked up with analytics, secure and prepared to scale should be a given (these are frequently included in any self-respecting API management solution).

I&rsquo;m coordinating with the development team for Developer.Trade.Gov today, providing them with a review of their new developer area, and some suggestions on how to make their APIs, and developer more usable.
The Developer.Trade.Gov is published as a Github repository, using Jekyll and Github Pages to actually deliver the website. The feedback I&rsquo;ve been giving to the team, has been done through the Github issue management for the repository.
One piece of feedback I left was:

I love that when I land on your home page, I get a brief description of what developer.trade.gov delivers, the probem is that the description is below the fold on some monitors, leaving just the 3 links available to see.
I'd switch the description and links, putting description at the top....and the first thing your eyes are drawn to. You'd be surprised how valuable this can be. Simple, but important.

I submitted&nbsp;the suggestion 5 hours ago, and I just received an update that the issue was closed, and my suggestions were incorporated. When you go to the Developer.Trade.Gov website now, you will see the text, with links to the right&mdash;creating a much more clean, informative, and usable way to deliver the most valuable real estate you have in your developer hub. It was a small, but quick and meaningful change to a government website.
Imagine if we could help other agencies see the benefit of publishing small, simple websites, developer hubs, single page apps, and other projects to Github, and manage their feedback loops via Github issues. What types of improvements in delivering government services would we see? What cost savings could be realized across government?

			<p>I got a gentle ping today, as I often do when there is a new developer hub or API launched in the federal government. This time it was located within the Department of Commerce, for the International Trade Administration, and was a new developer area, with five APIs at Developer.Trade.Gov. I quickly went through the new developer area, which I consider passing the test for a minimum viable developer area, possessing all the essential building blocks an API developer hub needs. The only places I feel it fell short is in the feedback loop, and providing machine readable definitions for each of the five APIs. I submitted my feedback as Github issues, on the repository for the developer hub, but when it comes to machine readable definitions for each of the five APIs, I know how easy this is, so rather than just submit issues, I figured I'd get to work generating the machine readable API definitions for Developer.Trade.Gov, and demonstrate what was possible. As I do with all of my work, I setup a subdomain, and Github repository, to store all of my work, and got to work on each of the five APIs: Market Research Library (Swagger) ITA Offices &amp; Centers (Swagger) Trade Events Trade Leads Trade News &amp; Articles I chose to use Swagger for creating my machine readable API definitions, and while I was waiting for the Github commit to take for the Market Research Library API Swagger definition + Swagger UI, I got to work on the ITA Offices &amp; Centers API. As I was finishing up, I reloaded the interactive docs for the Market Research Library API, and got the dreaded CORS warning: Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://api.trade.gov/market_research_library/search?keyword=travel. This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS. That is where the fun ends for me.

I spoke with Phil Windley (@windley) over at Brigham Young University (BYU) about their API strategy this morning. BYU is bringing together API providers and consumers, to establish a coordinated strategy for delivering designing, deploying, managing, and integrating with APIs across campus--an effort being led by CIO Kelly Flannagan (@kelflanagan).
As part of their latest API effort, BYU is focusing in on the lowest hanging fruit when it comes to campus resources:

Students
Instructors
Classrooms
Classes
Courses

The API team is still struggling with a handful of technical details like how to deal with unique identifiers, and relationship between resources, but overall they are on a healthy path when it comes to getting their API designed, and deployed for use at the institution. I&rsquo;m interested in seeing how fast they progress with a top down approach to APIs, vs the bottom up efforts I&rsquo;m seeing at institutions like UC Berkeley.
I will be talking their team regularly, about their design, deployment, management, and integration strategy. I want to make sure and document the process all along the way, and share real-time updates that other universities can follow along, or possibly collaborate with us when it comes to establishing some common API patterns we can share and re-use across higher educational institutions.
Look for any stories out of BYU, here on API Evangelist, or over at my university API research site, and if you are doing any API work at your school, I'd love to know more about it.

I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, and bring them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist. I just wrote a piece on replacing legacy systems at the VA using APIs, where one of the systemic constraints in place that restricts the modernizzation VA systems using API is purely about money, and more specifically the color of money. I won&rsquo;t bore you with the detail of the topic, but in short the color of money is: Money appropriated for one purpose cannot be used for a different purpose, according to the Purpose Act (31 U.S.C. &sect; 1301). In short, if $50M was given to sustain an existing legacy system, and that money cannot be re-appropriated, and applied to the newer system, what incentive is there to ever get rid of legacy VA systems, or modernize any government system for that matter? Whether it is usng APIs, or anything else. Newer approaches to using technology are difficult to accept when you are working hard to accomplished your job each day, but if you already have $50M in budget to a specific job, and that job won&rsquo;t go away, unless you choose to make it go away, guess what happens? Nothing changes&hellip;hmmm? As I said before, I don&rsquo;t give a shit if you deploy APIs from the ground up, or excite via a presidential mandates from the top down, if you have incentives in place for employees to do the opposite, based upon how money is allocated, you won&rsquo;t be changing any behavior or culture&mdash;you are wasting your energy.

I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, and bring them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist. One of the jobs I was tasked with at the VA as a PIF, was taking inventory of the web services within the agency. When asking folks where these web services were, I was directed to various IT Leads on different groups, each giving one or two more locations I could look for word, excel, or other PDFs talking about web services used in projects and known systems. Most of the time these were redundant lists, pointing me to the same 5 web services, and omitting 20-30 that were actually in use for a project. At one point I was given the contact information for a lady who had been working for two years on a centralized web registry project, that would be the holy grail of web service discovery at the VA. This was it! It was what I was looking for, until I sat in on the weekly call where this project got a 10 minute update, demonstrating that the registry was still about defining the how and what of the registry, and never has actually moved to cataloging actual web services in the wild at the VA. ;-( Then one day I was introduced to a gentlemen, that was in a back office, in an unmarked cubicle, who seemed to know where most of the web services were, the one difference with this person was that they were a contractor, and not an employee.

			<p><em>13 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>One of the byproducts of the Oracle vs Google API copyright case, was a realization that many API providers and consumer do not understand the layers of the API stack, let alone the potential licensing considerations for each layer of the API onion. I wouldn't just blame API providers, and consumers, I&rsquo;m still getting a grasp on all of this, which is why I'm blogging about the subject. Let&rsquo;s take a quick crack at defining the layers to the potential API licensing onion: Data - What is the licensing for the actual data returned and collected by an API? I&rsquo;m still learning about the ways to license your data, and the Open Data Commons provides some guidance in this area, while others feel that your data can just as be easily licensed using Creative Commons licensing. Data Model - The separation between data and its data model can be hard to see, where in reality end-users may own their data, but the order and structure of it can be owned by the originating application. If this layer is a concern, Creative Commons, or other copyright options should be considered. Server - Server side API code is the core of any API operations, and should be licensed accordingly using common open source software licenses&nbsp;when appropriate. However I would add that this is the one layer in the API stack where a proprietary licensing could make sense, but the rest of the stack should always be licensed as open as possible. Interface - The separation between the API and its surface area is important, and is something that is just becoming relevant with the Oracle v Google copyright case. Understanding the importance of an openly licensed surface area, is essential to the health of any API stack, and should be kep as open as possible, even when associated with a proprietary API backend. This is why we started API commons, to help API providers take a stance...[<a href="/2014/08/13/taking-a-look-at-the-api-licensing-stack/">Read More</a>]</p>

I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, slowly bringing them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist. On deck are my thoughts on replacing legacy systems with APIs, at the Department of Veteran Affairs. In the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, one of the motivations for deploying APIs, is to assist in the evolution, and replacement of legacy systems. The theory is, you have older system that needs to be replaced, and you can wrap in a modern web API, and slowly switch any desktop, web, mobile or other client system to use the new API&mdash;then you build out newer backend system, and make the switch in the API layer from the legacy to the newer backend system, leaving everything operating as expected. API magic! I'm used to hostile environments to this way of thinking, but most times in the private sector there are other business objectives that can be leveraged to get legacy system owners to get on board with a shift towards API deployment&mdash;I saw no incentive for this practice in the VA environment, where in reality there are incentives for IT, and business owners, as well as 3rd party contractors to keep legacy systems in place, not replace them. There are a variety of motivation for existing VA workers to keep existing systems in place, ranging from not understanding how the system works, to budgetary restrictions on how money flows in support of this pro-sustainment culture. Here is an example. There is old database for storing of a specific type of document, a database that X amount of existing desktop, server, web, or even mobile systems depend on.

I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, and bring them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist. I was given three projects when I started work at the VA: 1) Inventory data assets 2) Inventory web services 3) Move forward D2D, a forms web service that would allow VA hospitals and Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) to submit forms through the claims process on behalf of veteran. The most prevalent illness I witnessed across these three efforts was a unwillingness to trust outside groups (even VSOs and hospitals), and a lack of desire to share data and resources to anyone outside of the VA (ironically except contractors), to the point where groups seem to take defensive positions around what they did on behalf of our veterans. This culture makes for some pretty toxic environments, I personally feel contributing to much of the problems we&rsquo;ve seen bubble up into the public media space of late. While work at the VA you constantly hear about the VA claims backlog, and how we need to optimize, but when you bring up sharing data, or resources to other federal agencies, trusted external partners like hospitals, and VSO&rsquo;s you get pushback with concerns of security, personally identifiable information (PII), etc. All which are valid claims, but there are proven ways to mitigate these risks through Identify and Access Management (IAM), which is another whole post in itself. You start feeling crazy when you get pushback for arguing that a doctor should be able to submit disability questionnaires via an iPad application, that uses an existing VA API, in a way that securely authenticates the doctor.

I get regular requests to add APIs to my website via email, Twitter, and carrier pigeon. I have an Evernote that I put these requests into, and as I have time, I review, then possibly add to the appropriate API Evangelist network project.
To support this process, I've crafted a new response email to requests I get, that I thought I would share with everyone:

Sure thing. It could take me a day or two, or maybe up to a week.
You are also welcome to fork any of the 60+ API Evangelist network projects, and add to the JSON list that is driving the listing, they are all under the /data folder. Otherwise I'll add as I have time in the next week.
Once you submit your pull request, if your company listing is relevant to the research I&rsquo;m doing, I will accept your addition. No guarantees, so make sure it will provide value to not just my research, but to the API community.
Thanks for sharing information about your API!

It is a little known fact that all 60+ plus of my research projects run as Github repositories, using Github and Jekyll to drive the overall website and blog. With this approach, everyone can fork any of my projects, add a company to a listing, post to the blog, or correct a spelling or grammar error.
Just remember, when you are looking to get the word out about your API, or new feature, you can help curate and publish on the API Evangelist network.

			<p>I was taking another look at the Google Cloud Platform yesterday, and stumbled across Google Cloud Endpoints. It was something I saw come across my feeds, but really didn&rsquo;t give it the time it needed to see what it was all about. With the new Google Cloud Endpoints, Google is making a strong push to be not just an API deployment provider, but their approach also reflects what I&rsquo;d consider to be an evolution of backend as a service (BaaS) deployment. I think Google describes their service better than I can do it justice: Google Cloud Endpoints consists of tools, libraries and capabilities that allow you to generate APIs and client libraries from an App Engine application, referred to as an API backend, to simplify client access to data from other applications. Endpoints makes it easier to create a web backend for web clients and mobile clients such as Android or Apple's iOS. While much of the Google Cloud Platform offering looks a lot like the cloud offering over at Amazon Web Services, AWS definitely does not have API deployment as a service, baked into their cloud stack, like Google does with Google Cloud Endpoints. Google puts an emphasis on API endpoint deployment for mobile purposes, but leaves it open to be used in JavaScript as well&mdash;which seems a little limiting, since you could call same endpoints in any language. Oh well, I&rsquo;m not writing their marketing. ..the API backend is an App Engine app that performs business logic and other functions for Android and iOS clients, as well as JavaScript web clients. The functionality of the backend is made available to clients through Endpoints, which exposes an API that clients can call. Google provides SDKs for Android, iOS, and JavaScript, as well as a very Java heavy development process using Maven, combined with the Google Plugin for Eclipse, which&nbsp;is used to design, develop, and deploy your APIs to Google App Engine.

			<p>I hear this phrase used more and more lately, &ldquo;An API First Strategy&rdquo;. It is something you hear from startups like printing API LOB, to established players like Pearson, all the way up to 18F at the GSA in Washington DC, but what is API first? Much like APIs in general, an API first strategy is something that will mean something different to each company, organization, government agency, or individual. From my view, the most common interpretation of API first will be: Develop an API First - Before you build your website, web, mobile or single page application you develop an API first, then you get to work on defining the channels you will be making the API resources available on. I had an interesting conversation today with the 18F team in Washington DC, and they illuminated some other possible dimensions to the API first conversation for me, that I wanted to explore a little: Design Your API First - Using tools like Apiary, and API definition formats like API Blueprint, you kick off discussion with customers, generate user stories, and mockup your API, and even your web or mobile app interfaces, using your mock API. API First In Open Source Software - Encouraging the development and use of open source software solutions similar to Wordpress, that have API by default, so when agencies deploy them, they always have an API as part of their first steps for making access and integration decision&mdash;something that can drastically shift what is possible. My goal is to help small business, non-profit organizations, and government of all shapes and sizes understand the benefits of an API first strategy, so having conversation with API leaders like 18F, and getting their view on what API first means is essential to my storytelling process. How do you view API first at your company? How has your development lifecycle evolved since embracing APIs?

Steve and I are done messing with the format for a while, and want to encourage API providers to begin describing their APIs using the open format. After publishing the story last night, I also had an interesting comment on Google+ from Jonas Hellstr&ouml;m: The question got me thinking about how APIs.json rolled out. As with API Commons, APIs.json started as a conversation between Steve Willmott (@njyx) and I. Around the beginning of April we combined our notes on what each of us envisioned when it came to API discovery, establishing the first APIs.json definition with the timeline going roughly like this: April 2014&nbsp; Steve and I established version .11 of APIs.json We emailed a handful of smart folks that we trusted for feedback Crafted version .12 of APIs.json Developed APIs.io May 2014 We launched API.json at Gluecon in Broomfield, CO Encouraged discussion via the APIs.json Google Group Encouraged feedback via the Github issue management on APIs.json repo Cotinued email Conversations Established a Twitter presence for @apisjson Presented as part of session at API Days in Barcelona, Spain June 2014 Establish version 0.13 of APIs.json Continued discussion on Google Group Continued feedback on Github issue management Continued email conversations&nbsp; July 2014 Conducted a session on API discovery, including APIs.json at APICraft in Detroit Tony Tam (@fehguy) for the work on the JSON schema (thank you Tony!)

			<p><em>11 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>I just talked with Dave Devitt (@sydcon), President at SYDCON Web Development, Inc. in Chicago about how his web and mobile development shop sees the world APIs. I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for stories about how the everyday person on the ground at startups, all the way up to the federal government, actually see the world of APIs, and I was pleased that Dave could make some time to share his view of APIs with me. First, Dave said something I found very interesting when we first started our conversation. He said they were a &ldquo;web development shop&rdquo;, not in the the sense that they build websites, but that they develop applications that use the web for their operations. I think this is an important distinction when we start putting developers into buckets, and it isn&rsquo;t always as straightforward as building websites, web applications, mobile, single page or Internet of Things apps&mdash;we are now building software that uses the Internet for communication, something that will inevitably use all of these channels (and more). When it comes to API usage at SYDCON, they primarily use what we all call public APIs for driving commerce. Whether it is B2B or B2C, Dave&rsquo;s team is using APIs to sell products, integrate with payment systems like Authorize.net and PayPal, activating and validating of gift cards. Whether it is the nature of development or just a reflection on the type of customers SYDCON has, commerce is a pretty clear motivator for public API integration. The modern web API movement was started by commerce platforms like Amazon, eBay, and Paypal, and 14 years in it makes sense that commerce is a major driver of development at smaller develop shops. Beyond commerce, the main usage of APIs at SYDCON is about opening up access to internal resources that exist within their client systems, and making them available to buid apps on top of.

This pattern was evident in the Travel Agency Masters Big Data with Google BigQuery case study. I think the format for the case study provides a simple format that other API providers might consider following:

A catchy summary title&nbsp;
Challenge the company faced&nbsp;
Solution to the problem&nbsp;
A quote from company&nbsp;
Results from the solution


Additionally, Google provides an "At a Glance" summary in the left hand bar, for those busy folks who don't have the time to read case studies, providing a quick summary of the case study:

What they wanted to do&nbsp;
What they did&nbsp;
What they accomplished&nbsp;
About API service used

The outline for the case study, as well as the summary version is a nice, simple format that any API provider could use to when crafting their own API case study experience. The format allows for easy scanning by visitors, which allows for us busy folks to read, or quickly scan multiple case studies--giving more context to the potential value an API will deliver.

			<p><em>10 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>Steve (@njyx), Nicolas (@picsoung), and I have been working hard to gather all the feedback from some very smart folks on the API.json format. Now we are stoked to finally announce that we have the 0.14 version ready for prime time. Our goal with the first version of APIs.json, was to just get the idea out there to get feedback from the community, and after four iterations, we feel like the format is now something the community can really build on. First, lets recap, what is APIs.json? APIs.json is a machine readable JSON file that lives in the root of your domain, and describes your APIs and its supporting API program. Think of APIs.json as a robots.txt, or sitemap.xml from Google, but instead of describing all the pages of your website, an APIs.json describes your developer portal, all available APIs, and the supporting building blocks of your API program--allowing you to describe your API efforts whether it is a public, or private affair. The goal is simply to provide a machine readable description, that any search engine can crawl, and make sense of your overall API program, and each individual API resource. The real power of APIs.json lies in the properties that you can apply to your APIs. We wanted to start with providing basic links meant for humans, like a link to the API signup page, or documentation, but then quickly provide machine readable elements like a Swagger specification, or API Commons manifest. However we don&rsquo;t want to define and control all of the properties you use to describe your APIs, and while we have a short list of additional properties that we are adding in on the next version, you can use any property you like just by adding x- to your own type label. Along with the APIs.json 0.14 release, the API search engine APIs.io also supports the latest APIs.json format. You can now validate your APIs.json 0.14, and submit your API.json...[<a href="/2014/08/10/next-stable-version-of-apis-json-apis-io-is-ready-are-your-apis-discoverable/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m seeing an increase in the number of API deployment services this year, such as startups like StrongLoop and API Spark. These companies are looking to help all of us deploy APIs from common systems, often without the need for IT or programming resources.
The providers I&rsquo;m seeing emerge are catering to some of the lowest hanging fruit for deploying APIs. The commonly used, and easiest to access systems, that contain the valuable content, data, and media we need to make accessible via APIs.
The common source for many of these API deploy solutions are:

Excel Spreadsheet&nbsp;with&nbsp;SheetLabs
Google Spreadsheet&nbsp;from&nbsp;API Spark
Database&nbsp;At The&nbsp;Dream Factory

These common information sources, represent the places where the average person in any size company, organization or government agency will be storing their valuable resources.  It makes sense that this new wave of API deployment startups would target these services.
If you consider every system integration option that classic API gateways have delivered, it provides a good reference for finding opportunities for building independent API deployment solutions, that if done right, could be a startup all by itself.
Not all companies can afford a full API gateway solution, and their needs are too small for a gateway. There is an emerging opportunity to help people quickly deploy APIs from common sources like spreadsheet, database, file stores, as well as more unique sources like specialty CMS and CRM systems.
Sometimes I like to look at the expanding API universe as a result of the SOA big bang, where all the tools that were in your SOA toolbox, being liberated, and available as independent services that you can get from an increasing number of new API deployment startups.

In preparation for API Strategy &amp; Practice in Chicago, September 24-26th, I did a little research on where the good beers, and specifically the kick-ass IPAs can be found. You may not know, but in addition to being the API Evangelist, I am also the IPA Evangelist (plan b career path), and I'm always interested in knowing where the killer IPAs are, in addition to knowing where to find the best APIs.&nbsp;
While in Chicago we want to be able to have the tasiest beer possible at the conference, while also having the best options for finding good beer and food after the event to network and socialize with the 600+ folks that will be at #APIStrat. To prepare for #APIStrat I found 32 local Chicago breweries:

			<p><em>08 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>A blog is such a simple thing, but when it comes to the world of APIs, it can be one of the most important signals for whether or not an API is worthy of integration, or you should just move on and continue looking for another API to use. I know many folks will dismiss that a blog is so relevant, especially if they are coming from IT or developer disciplines--I respectfully decline. In reality, a blog not only provides a great way to keep API consumers up to date, it also provides the essential human face to any API operation. An API&rsquo;s blog provides a regular flow of information that show there is someone behind the curtain, who is not just working on the API, but actively is contributing ideas to the API community, and is there to support. A blog is the number one signal for me when evaluating the quality of an API. I track on whether an API has a blog, how of the blog is updated, and how long since the last post. Using these signals, it is pretty easy to tell when a public API is getting the resources it needs, and when the support for a public API is losing steam within a company. Here is an example of this in action&mdash;back in April I commented on the ESPN API: It is sad that the last ESPN "API-focused musings and ramblings" was 1 year ago ;-( http://t.co/sMWDoFtacJ &gt;&gt; I prefer them more often &mdash; Kin Lane (@kinlane) April 16, 2014 Sure enough, four short months later, ESPN announces they are shutting down their public APIs.

			<p><em>08 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve launched a new API news site, designed to provide short news updates from across the world of APIs. The API Report is the newest part of the API Evangelist network of sites, with apievangelist.com as the analysis on the business of APIs, apivoice.com as the analysis on the politics of APIs, and the the API Report as the industry news heartbeat. The API Report is built on Github, as a public repository, using Github Pages, and Jekyll. This approach to blogging opens up the news site to a new form of collaborative publishing, allowing anyone to fork, author their own API news story, and make a pull request for publishing to the site. Every commit will be reviewed for quality, and either rejected, or published to the live API Report website. Each post should follow a simple format, allowing for easy scanning of the days API news by consumers. The API Report has an RSS feed, as well as a Twitter account, for reader and social syndication. Soon, the API Report will also have its own advertising network, which will allow anyone to purchase any of the advertising slots available in the header, right hand sidebar, and in the body of all blog posts. Advertising will be priced very low at first, but as pageviews grow, and demand increases, and weekly market rate will be set--allowing for weekly turnover of advertising opportunities. If you are an API provider of any shape or size, or an API enthusiast, I recommend you help craft stories for the API Report, fork the site, and make a pull request, anytime you have a new piece you want share. Once the API Report advertising is up and running, and being monetized, I will be setting aside 50% of revenue and sharing with all contributors based upon pageviews.

			<p>ESPN just announced that they will no longer be accepting registrations for public API keys, and discontinuing all of their public APIs. I saw a few enraged comments on the Twitterz when I originally tweeted out the story, and also saw a couple of people compare it to the recent Netflix API deprecation. In reality I don't think the shuttering of the public ESPN API, or the Netflix API is a reflection on the viability of APIs, steering clear of the usual API FUD that APIs are forever, wait no&hellip;they can go away at any time! I think the decision to shutter the ESPN API is due to lack of vision, outreach, and the establishment of the vital developer feedback loops that are necessary to make APIs successful, but most importantly they failed to understand the challenges faced when deploying APIs in a tightly controlled industry. Doing public APIs in tightly controlled spaces like the movie and sports industry has to be tough. Both to these spaces have built their empires on tightly controlling the content, messaging, distribution, branding, and other elements&mdash;which are all things that work against the ethos of a successful public API strategy. In my mind it shows that APIs aren&rsquo;t really the thing we all claim they are, it is everything that comes bundled the API, and a company's willingness to evolve. I&rsquo;m sure we'll see waves of other companies, who come from legacy industries like movies, sports, publishing, television, and other similar sectors, try APIs, thinking they will be a technological silver bullet, in coming years who also neglect to pay attention to the business and politics of APIs that will provide essential building blocks that support the technology. There are plenty of lessons to be learned from both ESPN and Netflix, but two that stand out for me, is the importance of understanding the entire lifecycle of the resources you are making available, and the value of having a...[<a href="/2014/08/08/public-apis-are-tough-when-you-are-in-a-tightly-controlled-industry/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Swagger is now Open API Definition Format (OADF) -- READ MORE I went through 77 federal government API developer portals a couple of weeks ago, as part of some API discovery work I&rsquo;m doing with APIs.json. I ended up targeting 120 APIs that I will be generating of Swagger definitions, and API.json for their umbrella domain, or subdomain over the next couple months. As I made my way through each of these developer areas, I began to realize that I would have to sign up for API keys at each of these developer areas. I&rsquo;m sure some of the APIs will not require a key, but it is still potentially 77 separate API keys (I will let you know the final count when I know), that I will have to register for&mdash;the federal government needs a common, yet distributed API management strategy. To augment this common, yet distribution API management strategy, I would like to be able to just use Github oAuth to ping an API provider, request my application keys, and using the Github API to then store them in a repository of my choosing. I store all of my API keys for my applications, in a central location that my apps can securely put to use, and in many cases these apps are already using a private Github repository as a centralized configuration location. I shouldn't have to go through 77 separate API registration flows to get the API keys I need. I should be able to get API access in a programmatic way, using my existing Github account, and put Github oAuth to use in an authentication flow, getting the API keys I need in real time, in the location that I need them. This API access workflow would allow me to quickly gain access to resources I need for my apps, and store all my API keys in a single, or across multiple Github repositories&mdash;potentially giving me a simple, but powerful...[<a href="/2014/08/08/give-me-a-url-to-request-then-store-my-api-keys-in-my-private-github-repo/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Daniel Jacobson - Scaling the Netflix API I was learning more about the discovery of private APIs with the Charles App, and was fascinated by its potential to visualize, and map the darkest regions of the API realm. There is a lot of speculation about the number of APIs out there, with the 10K+ public APIs that are currently available being the &ldquo;tip of the iceberg&rdquo;, and the number of private APIs rpresenting the rest of the surface area below the dark surface--making the approach that Tim Rogers (and others) employ a tantalizing option for mapping these dark waters of the rapidly expanding API space. HTTP proxing and monitoring solutions like Charles are nothing new, and there are a wealth of next generation&nbsp;API integration tools like Runscope and APITools available, but what is interesting about this, is the routing all of your app traffic for your laptop, tablet or smartphone through a proxy, and record not just the traffic between you and the private APIs your apps depend on, but the mapping out the API interface, request, response, and underlying data models. Before I continue with this story, I have to admit this is a little on the dark side of APIs, and is something I don't recommend doing, because you are going to piss off a whole bunch of API providers&mdash;regardless, I think it is an interesting idea, that is worth sharing and discussing. What if someone packaged up an HTTP proxy, monitoring, and provided a recording layer for the interface, requests, responses, and data models, scrubbed out PII, and allowed individuals to opt in and publish the resulting definitions to a shared, public registry? Of course you would not publish your own transmissions, and underlying data, you would only publish the interface, requests, responses, and data models for the private APIs that are driving your public mobile and tablet applications. This centralized location would then aggregate, and shed light on this dark region,...[<a href="/2014/08/07/mapping-the-world-of-internal-apis-via-rogue-api-registry/">Read More</a>]</p>

I began exploring the use a restaurant menu to help people understand API copyright, and how your API definition is not your secret sauce, and that there is so much more to your API that just the surface area.
I'm continuing my exploration of using restaurants as an analogy to help onboard people with not just API copyright, but introducing APIs to the masses--helping them understand the layers to the API space, in a way that is familiar.
To prepare for future stories and conversations I'm expanding on my API definition = Menu analogy with:

API Providers = Restaurant Owners
Developer Portal = Restaurant
APIs = Food &amp; Drink Items
API Definition + Docs = Menu
API Consumers (Apps) = Restaurant&nbsp; Customers (People)
Freemium - Samples Out Front
Partner Access = Catering
Terms of Service = We Reserve The Right To Refuse - No Substitutions
API Service Providers = Restaurant Equipment Providers

Obviously it is work in progress. I will need better stories and visuals to get the concept across. Then once I start working through the different types of restaurants (ie. American, Chinese, Mexican, Fusion, etc), I'm sure I'll flush out more, while also potentially hitting some dead ends.
Explaining what an API is, let alone the versatility and flexibility of an API, is really hard. I need as many tools in my API toolbox to help get people up to speed, understanding what an API is, and how it can apply to their business. We'll see where I go with the restaurant analogy, who knows it might be a dead end. It proved to be extremeley valuable in helping people understand API copyright, and I'm hopefull it will do the same for APIs in general.

			<p>Download as PDF I spend a great deal of time looking at new APIs from companies, institutions, and government agencies during my weekly monitoring of the API space, and over the last couple years, I've come across an increasing number of APIs tht are out of higher educational institutions around the world. It began with a centralized developer area at the University of Washington (UW), and then I saw the same from UC Berkeley, with more recently noticing the impressive conversion of 250+ services from a traditional Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), to a more modern web API approach, at Brigham Young University (BYU). Along the way I began seeing that APIs at higher education institutions were going to be an important piece of the overall API puzzle, and as I do with any research area, I setup a Github repository (university.apievangelist.com), and began tracking on universities who were doing anything interesting with APIs, no matter how small. I now track on twelve separate higher education institutions that have active API efforts, and I have been engaging in active conversations with two of the institutions, regarding their strategy, working to understand how I can provide any guidance, but also learn from each team about the unique challenges higher education institutions face when designing, deploying, manage, and even evangelize their APIs. My university API research has now reached a level, where I have enough material to produce a white paper, so over the last couple months, I&rsquo;ve worked to compile all of my work into a single downloadable narrative. As with all of my API research, this white paper will change often, as my work is never done. I&rsquo;ll keep adding institutions, and evolving my understanding an awareness of APIs in higher education as long as there is meaningful activity to be found.

			<p>I moderated a panel of hypermedia experts at API Craft in Detroit last week. One theme that dominated not just the panel, but was also pervasive in the conversation over the next two days of the API event, was how can the hypermedia space, improve its overall image, message, and potentially reach a wider audience, and maybe even converting some of the hypermedia skeptics, to hypermedia evangelists. After a session at #APICraft, dedicated to understanding all the hypermedia hate, Mike Amundsen (@mamund) and I continued the conversation, where he stated: When it comes to hypermedia, and technology online, reasonable just doesn't sell. This statement sums up my views of the current state of the hypermedia conversation. I went into the event expecting a very heated debate, filled with very intelligent, passionate, yet opinionated and hard-headed individuals. If you even lightly pay attention to the world of APIs, you probably have stumbled across the conversation between passionate REST practitioners (aka Restafarians), and the more recently the select group of hypermedia specialists&mdash;producing an image that is perceived by some as passionate, opinionated, and pushy, or even portrayed as being down right mean, nasty, delusional and confrontational by some. What I saw on the hypermedia panel last Monday, and over the next two days at #APICraft, was anything but the popular image of REST and the hypermedia community. I don&rsquo;t dismiss that some REST, and hypermedia practitioners can be rude, mean, and less than tolerant of those of us who don&rsquo;t quite understand every detail, but this group of hypermedia leaders were anything but. They were humble, articulate, and eager to better understand the hypermedia approaches of their colleagues, and try to understand how to better get the message out to the larger public. So where does this image come from? I think there are two camps, who are equally to blame: 1) The hypermedia pioneers 2) The hypermedia skeptics&nbsp;&mdash; the rest of us are just along for...[<a href="/2014/08/05/the-hypermedia-api-debate-sorry-reasonable-just-does-not-sell/">Read More</a>]</p>

Really? &mdash; Irakli Nadareishvili (@inadarei) August 3, 2014 @inadarei they are slow moving beasts, and some will be eaten away at, but many will be able to continue to exists as legacy beasts. #sad &mdash; Kin Lane (@kinlane) August 3, 2014 @kinlane and the reason why we LOVE @twilio: they hid the mess of telecom behind a nice API. WE need @twilio for each such legacy beast :) &mdash; Irakli Nadareishvili (@inadarei) August 3, 2014 @inadarei amen. hide the legacy. be progressive. evolve and move forward. I should do a white paper, using @twilio as blueprint to guide &mdash; Kin Lane (@kinlane) August 3, 2014 @kinlane @inadarei banking and healthcare have steep barriers to entry. Won't see much change unless threatened or major $$$ to be made. &mdash; Dave Goldberg (@davidgoldberg) August 3, 2014 @kinlane yeap AND: make a lot of money while you are at it. @twilio proved that hiding legacy behind a nice API can be great business #cool &mdash; Irakli Nadareishvili (@inadarei) August 3, 2014 @davidgoldberg they'll never change themselves, but we...[<a href="/2014/08/04/twilio-the-hell-out-of-the-largest-and-most-important-industries/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I originally started writing this post after API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam, where I had numerous conversations with banks, about the potential of APIs, and how banks might be starting to move from talk to action, when it comes to their API programs. After recent talks with a couple more folks, behind the scenes at banks, I&rsquo;m pretty convinced, as the enterprise are doing in other sectors, banks are slowly waking up to the potential of APIs&mdash;something that has taken a long time, as they slowly come out of their bank vaults, where they were hiding during the economic meltdown. When you Google the phase "banking API", you see the signs that the space is ripe for disruption with APIs from two open banking pioneers: The Open Bank Project - an open source API and App store for banks that empowers financial institutions to securely and rapidly enhance their digital offerings using an ecosystem of 3rd party applications and services Plaid - The Modern API for Banking Data, allowing developers to programmatically interact with banks and credit cards These players do not represent movement from the banking space itself, the conversation I&rsquo;ve had with Visa, Mastercard, Capital One, Rabobank, and others I can&rsquo;t even mention are notoriously closed about what they are doing, but these new open banking API platforms do represent the opportunity that exists in the space. Until I see robust, open developer areas from Chase, HSBC, Citigroup, and other banking giants, I won&rsquo;t declare APIs getting traction in the banking sector, but I think the ice is thawing, and I feel we are moving from just banks talking about APIs, to banks maybe, kinda sorta considering taking action when it comes to APIs. Hopefully I will get to talk about more of my conversations in the future, until then I will just showcase what The Open Bank Project and Plaid are up to, hopefully through public, competitive, and regulatory pressure, banks...[<a href="/2014/08/03/as-we-recover-the-banking-industry-seems-to-be-warming-up-to-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>When visiting an API developer area, as soon as the page loads,&nbsp;you can tell if its an organized effort, or something that was thrown up by a single project or team. Half of the institutions I track on as part of my university API monitoring have a centralized developer area for their APIs, as well as what appears to be an organized approach behind the designing, deploying, managing or evangelizing their APIs.&nbsp;  I&rsquo;ve talked with both&nbsp;University of California Berkeley and Brigham Young Universities about their API strategies, while only having light communication with University of Washington and Michigan. I feel there are some interesting lessons to be had when taking a look at these six leading universities.

			<p><em>02 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>While at API Craft in Detroit this week I had the pleasure of hanging with two leads on the WordPress(org) development team, and discuss the API strategy for the blogging platform. Andrew Nacin (@nacin), Lead Developer, and Ryan McCue (@rmccue), WordPress Plugin Developer, facilitated an open circle discussion to work through the challenges that WordPress is facing when developing an API for the open source blogging platform. At face value, I know a number of API developers who will be less than pleased when they hear about a WordPress API, as both PHP, and WordPress are easy targets for developer&rsquo;s hatred, for generating less than perfect code. ;-) But, in the end you can&rsquo;t ignore some of the stats on WordPress usage: Used by more than 22.0% of the top 10 million websites as of August 2013 Most popular blogging system in use on the Web, used in more than 60 million websites Over 409 million people view more than 15.5 billion pages each month Users produce about 41.7 million new posts and 60.5 million new comments each month These stats don&rsquo;t even touch on the number of WordPress plugins and mobile solutions there are developed on the insanely popular website, and blogging platform. I couldn't think of a better platform to start rolling APIs out APIs to the masses, and quickly educating a very large group of tech savvy folks along the way. Many of these WordPress sites are already integrated with popular API platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Google, and Amazon, so it makes sense to educate WordPress administrators on the APIs they are already using, as well as introduce them to the concept of having their own API around the potentially valuable content they generate. We Are Talking About Developing 60 M+ Distributed APIs There is no API deployment or management service provider that is even close to numbers of this magnitude. When ready, the WordPress API will give millions of websites, and...[<a href="/2014/08/02/everyone-is-about-to-get-an-api-with-the-new-wordpress-api/">Read More</a>]</p>
