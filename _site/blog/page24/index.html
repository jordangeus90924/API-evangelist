	<h3>The API Evangelist Blog</h3>
	<p>This blog is dedicated to understanding the world of APIs, exploring a wide range of topics from design to deprecation, and spanning the technology, business, and politics of APIs. <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-evangelist" target="_blank">All of this runs on Github, so if you see a mistake, you can either fix by submitting a pull request, or let us know by submitting a Github issue for the repository</a>.</p>

<p>I am spending some time profiling the companies who are part of my API monitoring research, specifically learning about <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/organizations/">the APIs they offer as part of their solutions</a>. I do this work so that I can better understand what API monitoring service providers are offering, but also for the discoveries I make along the way--this is how I keep API Evangelist populated with stories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An interesting API I came across during this work was from the <a href="https://www.site24x7.com">Site24X7 monitoring service</a>, specifically <a href="https://www.site24x7.com/help/api/#sla-settings">their service level agreement (SLA) API</a>. An API for adding, managing, and reporting against SLA's that you establish as part of the monitoring of your APIs. Providing a pretty interesting API pattern that seems like it should be part of the default API management stack for all API providers.</p>
<p>This would allow API providers to manage SLA's for their operations, but also potentially expose this layer for each consumer of the API, letting them understand SLA"s that are in place, and whether or not they have been met--in a way that could be seamlessly integrated with existing systems. An API for SLA management for API providers seems like it could also be a standalone operation as well, helping broker this layer of the API economy, and provide a rating system for how well API providers are holding up their end of the API contract.</p>

<p>One area I am keeping an eye on while profiling APIs, and API service providers, are any security-related practices that I can add to my research. While looking through DataDog I came across <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/security/">their pretty thorough security page</a>, providing some interesting building blocks that I will add to my <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">API security research</a>. This is all I do as the API Evangelist--aggregate the best practices of existing providers, and shine a light on what they are up to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On their security page, DataDog provides details on physical and corporate security, information about data in transit, at rest, as well as retention, including personally identifiable information (PII), and details surrounding customer data access. They also provide details of their monitoring agent and how it operates, as well as how they patch, employ SSO, and require their staff to undergo security awareness training. The important part of this is that they encourage you to disclose any security issues you find--critical for providers to encourage this.</p>
<p>Transparency when it comes to security practice is an important tool in our API security toolbox. It is important that API providers share their security practices like DataDog does, helping build trust, and demonstrate competency when it comes to operations. I'm working on an API security page template for <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">my default API portal</a>, and DataDog's approach provides me with some good elements I can add to my template.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-algorithmic-transparency-2.png" alt="" width="25%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am increasingly hearing the phrase, "the benefits outweigh&nbsp;the risks" applied when talking about AI, machine learning, and the increasing number of algorithmic decisions that are being made in all parts of our digital world. This seems&nbsp;to be the new default of AI and machine learning advocates looking to tip the scales in favor of their technology, over the human side of the discussion.</p>
<p>This can be found used in discussions about AI used in self-driving cars, all the way to policing algorithms making decisions on the street or in a court of law. I'm not opposed to this argument if it is truly the case, but it seems something you can claim without providing the data behind this decision, and simply relying on your lack of faith in humans being able to consistently making decisions.</p>
<p>This is why <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/23/the-sharing-of-data-via-apis-will-be-key-to-viability-of-every-industry/">I wrote about the important of data sharing in industries where algorithms are making an impact</a>, and I am an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/04/pushing-for-more-algorithmic-transparency-using-apis/">advocate for providing API access for journalists, analysts, and regulators to actually follow-up with claims that are being made</a>. Allowing 3rd parties to actual weight the pros and cons, and make a collective, more fair and balanced determination of whether or not the benefits truly do outweigh&nbsp;the risk.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that folks who make these claims are being dishonest, but in my experience, in the API space most folks blindly believe in tech and their algorithms, and seem to have almost no faith in humans, and are more than happy to make false claims in the service of the algorithm. This is why I have to say that you can't ever tell me the benefits outweigh the risk without some algorithmic transparency involved--it just won't mean anything to me.</p>

<p>Adding to the many reasons you would want, or not want APIs these days, is the escalating cyber war playing out on the web around the world. APIs aren't playing a role in the cyber security realm in the way you'd think, allowing the bad guys, or even the good guys to get into systems, but they are how these actors are spreading information&nbsp;or disinformation about their cyber activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Increasingly Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, and other API driven platforms are being used to broadcast, engage, and study the fast growing world of&nbsp;cyber security. Whether it is the <a href="http://www.idf.il/1524-en/Dover.aspx">Israeli Defense Force</a>, U.S. Cyber Command, or a 15-year-old hacker in your basement, they are using these API driven channels to broadcast their message, as well as monitor the message of their adversaries, with us analysts&nbsp;following up behind trying to make sense of it all--using the same channels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving forward if you have a platform with an API, you will have a stage for the <a href="http://cybersecurity.theater">Cybersecurity.Theater</a> to play out. Actors will use you to tell their story, to communicate, syndicate images, publish their videos, and make their payments. This will scare the shit out of many of you, but for others, it will be an opportunity to sell popcorn&nbsp;and other concession items.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since "securing cyberspace is a 24/7 responsibility&nbsp;(United States army Cyber Command and Second Army), it will need a 24/7, API driven theater to perform in.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-conversational-interfaces.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I am exploring, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/29/flow-abstraction-and-intent-layer-on-top-of-apis-to-feed-the-bots/">writing about&nbsp;Meya's&nbsp;Bot Flow Markup Language (BFML)</a>, &nbsp;I came across the announcement from Google about their acquisition of API.AI, titled "<a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2016/09/making-conversational-interfaces-easier-to-build.html">Making Conversational Interfaces Easier to Build</a>". I feel like this description reflects what I was writing about "<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/29/beyond-mobile-api-ready-for-ipaas-voice-and-bots/">Beyond Mobile: API Ready For iPaaS, Voice, and Bots</a>", and sounds better to me than saying voice, bot, or integration workflow.</p>
<p>Whether its skills for voice enablement, intents and flows for bot interactions, or triggers, actions, and integrations with iPaaS, I'm guessing we are going to need a way to define, and convey meaning through this growing conversation we'll be having using API resources. With <a href="https://openapis.org/specification">OpenAPI Spec</a> and <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> we finally have adequate ways to describe where our data, content, and algorithmic resources reside, and a little bit about what they do, but it feels like we need a similar way of defining the conversational layer on top.</p>
<p>I see the beginning of this present in&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/29/flow-abstraction-and-intent-layer-on-top-of-apis-to-feed-the-bots/">Meya's&nbsp;Bot Flow Markup Language (BFML)</a>, which is a YAML definition description a flow, made of components that can each make an API call, all in the services of what they consider "intent". &nbsp;I"ll have to see how other bot providers are defining this layer, as well as learn more about how Alexa is defining the conversational layer for their skills. All of this smells like <a href="http://www.hydra-cg.com/">we need some Hydra injected into the conversation</a>, but I need to do more research before I start evangelizing anything.</p>
<p>The whole Slackbot thing is interesting to me from a technical point of view--not so much from a business side of things. Twitter bots I find intriguing because they are public, and can wreak havoc, or be very creative. Alexa is interesting from both a technical&nbsp;and business perspective for me. But, helping define a conversational layer on top of the world of APIs is intriguing to me, mostly because it continues building on top of what I consider to be one of the key strengths of APIs--making very abstract technical things more accessible and meaningful to humans in a digital world.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_sdk_expanding.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have been doing a lot of thinking about the <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">client</a> and <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">SDK</a> areas of my research lately, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/29/flow-abstraction-and-intent-layer-on-top-of-apis-to-feed-the-bots/">considering how these areas overlap with the world of bots</a>, as well <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/29/beyond-mobile-api-ready-for-ipaas-voice-and-bots/">as with voice, and iPaaS</a>. I'm thinking about the hand-crafted, autogenerated, and even API client as a service like Postman, and Paw. I'm thinking about how APIs are being put to work, across not just web and mobile, but also systems to system integration, and&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit">the skills in voice platforms like Alexa</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/making-meya/standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants-2b89817fdff7#.10z1s2qfr">the intents in bot platforms like Meya</a>.</p>
<p>I'm considering how APIs can deliver the skills needed for the next generation of apps beyond just a mobile phone. I kicked off my SDK research over a year ago, where I track on the approaches of leading platforms who are offering up code samples, libraries, and SDKs in a variety of programming languages. While conducting my research, I've been seeing the definition of what is an SDK slowly expand and get more specialized, with most of the expansion in these areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile Development Kit -</strong> Providing code resources to help developers integrate their iPhone, Android, Windows, and other mobile&nbsp;applications with APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Platform Development Kits -</strong> Provide code resources for using APIs in other specific platforms like WordPress, SalesForce, and others.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to mobile, and specific platform solutions, I am seeing API providers stepping up and providing iPaaS options, like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/29/beyond-mobile-api-ready-for-ipaas-voice-and-bots/">ClearBit is doing with their Zapier solution</a>s. As part of this brainstorm exercise, I feel like I should also add a layer dedicated to delivering via iPaaS:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integration Platform as a Service Development Kits - </strong>Delivering code resources for use in iPaaS services like Zapier, allowing for simpler system to system integration across many different platforms, with some having a specific industry focus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, if I scroll down the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">home page of API Evangelist,</a> I can easily spot 11 other areas of my research that stand out as either areas I'm seeing SDK movement&nbsp;or an area I'd consider to be an SDK opportunity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voice Development Kit - </strong>Code resources to support voice application and device integrations.</li>
<li><strong>Bot Development Kit -</strong> Code resources for delivering bot implementations on various platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Visualization Development Kit -</strong> Code resources and tooling for helping deliver visualizations derived from data, content, and algorithms via API.</li>
<li><strong>Virtualization Development Kit -</strong> Code resources to support the creation of sandbox environments, use of dummy data, and other virtualization scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Command Line Development Kit -</strong> Code resources to support usage of API resources accessed via command line interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable Development Kit -</strong> Code resources providing embeddable JavaScript buttons, badges, and other widgets.</li>
<li><strong>Orchestration Development Kit - </strong>Code resources and schema for use in continuous integration and other delivery tooling and services.</li>
<li><strong>Real Time Development Kit - </strong>Code resources designed to augment API resources with real-time features and technology.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheet Development Kit - </strong>Code resources designed for using spreadsheets as API data source, as well as putting API resources to use in spreadsheet environments.</li>
<li><strong>Drone Development Kit -</strong>&nbsp;Code resources designed to support drones, and the hardware, application, and networks that support them.</li>
<li><strong>Auto Development Kit -</strong>&nbsp;Code resources designed specifically for integration with major manufacturer and 3rd party aftermarket platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am thinking about open source solutions in a variety of programming languages, that put APIs to work for delivering data, content, and algorithms for delivery to the specialized endpoints above. I've seen mobile development kits evolve out of the standard approach to providing APIs SDKs out of the need to deliver resources to mobile phones, over questionable networks, and a constrained UI. This type of expansion will continue to grow, increasing the demand for specialized client solutions that all employ the same stack of web APIs.</p>
<p>This is just some housekeeping and brainstorming&nbsp;<a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">client</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">SDK</a>&nbsp;areas of my research. I'm just working to understand how some of the other areas of my research are potentially overlapping with these layers. After seeing common patterns in iPaaS, Voice, and Bots, it got me thinking about other areas I've seen similar patterns occur. Obviously, these aren't areas of SDK development that all API providers should be thinking about, but depending on your target audience, a handful of them may apply.</p>
<p>I go back on forth regarding the importance of SDKs to API integration. I enjoy watching the API client as a service providers like <a href="http://getpostman.com">Postman</a> and <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a>, as well as straight up SDK solutions like <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a>. When I crack open tooling like the <a href="http://editor.swagger.io">Swagger </a><a href="http://editor.swagger.io">Editor</a>, and services like APIMATIC, I'm impressed with the increasing number of platforms available for deployment--enabling both API deployment and consumption. As I watch API service providers like Restlet and Apiary evolve their design, deployment, and management solutions to cater t more stops along the API life cycle, I find myself more interested in what could be next.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/30/a-plan-b-api-switch/">A Plan B API Switch</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">30 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-plan-b.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've had an idea for a bot-related&nbsp;service I call "plan b", which would act as a secondary action for any sort of bot request / response to an API. When developers are providing common bot responses like looking up a business address, sports statistic or stock quote, it could be exposed to suggestions for a "plan b". When a request is made, it can travel via its regular path, but it would also be included in a queue&nbsp;where other 3rd party developers could provide plan b suggestions, either free or paid. When a user is engaging with the bot and didn't like the primary response, they could click on the "plan b" option, opening up alternative responses. In theory, the user could cycle through each "plan b" suggestion until they find a suitable response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I don't have any startup aspirations&nbsp;I enjoy&nbsp;working through these ideas on my blog as part of my wider research, I found myself thinking my Plan B bot&nbsp;idea as I was learning about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/29/flow-abstraction-and-intent-layer-on-top-of-apis-to-feed-the-bots/">Meya's&nbsp;<span>Bot Flow Markup Language</span></a>, and in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/28/thinking-about-how-i-can-build-change-resilience-into-my-api-integrations/">the context of how we can build in resilie</a>ncy into API client code. The concept of a plan B seems extremely relevant to this discussion, and worth consideration beyond just bots, into voice, iPaaS, and other clients being put to work on top of APIs.</p>
<p>In the context of fault and change resistance, it seems like we'd have a "plan b" layer in our SDKs to deal with when an API goes away temporarily, or even permanently. I know I do not have ANY plan b in place for any of my API integrations, either directly in the SDK, or in my business strategy--I am guessing this is the case for most API integrations. It seems like responding to status codes etc could be considered fault-tolerance (micro), where a plan b option would be in the change resistance category (macro).</p>
<p>I had pictured "plan b" being some sort of hypermedia layer that could be applied to the world of bots, providing alternative options alongside each API call. I am going to expand on this definition to include resiliency. Maybe we can incentivize resiliency through the discovery of better responses, or even possibly monetization opportunities when commerce behavior(s) are involved. I'll keep brainstorming on my plan b idea, something that is a little more interesting now that it isn't just about bot response discovery and monetization, and might actually provide a plan b switch for resiliency and API brokering at the client and SDK level.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Sep 2016</span>
        <p>I'm looking through a new API definition focused service provider called <a href="http://schemahub.io/">SchemaHub</a> today, and I found their approach to using Github as a base of operations was interesting and provided a nice blueprint for other API server providers to follow. I'm continually amazed at the myriad of ways that Github can be put to use in the world of APIs, which is one of the things I love about it.</p>
<p>As a base for SchemaHub, <a href="https://github.com/schemahub">they created a Github Org</a>, and made their <a href="https://github.com/schemahub/schemahub.github.io">first repository the website for the service</a>, hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. In my opinion, this is how all API services should begin, as a repo, under an organization on Github--leveraging the social coding platform as a base for their operations.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/schemahub/schemahub.github.io"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/schemahub_github.png" alt="" width="100%" align=" alt=" /></a></p>
<p>SchemaHub is taking advantage of Github for hosting their API definition focused project--free, version controlled, static website hosting for schemahub.io.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_09_28_at_7.34.36_pm.png" alt="" width="100%" align=" alt=" /></p>
<p>As I was looking through their site, learning about what they are doing I noticed a subscription button at the bottom of the page, asking me to subscribe, and they'll notify me when things are ready.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/schemahub_subscribe.png" alt="" width="75%" align=" alt=" /></p>
<p>Once I clicked on the button, I was taken for a Github OAuth dance, which now makes SchemaHub not just a Github repo for the site, it is an actual Github Application that I've authenticated with using my Github account. They only have access to my profile and email, but is the types of provider to developer connection I like to see in the API world.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/authorize_schemahub.png" alt="" width="100%" align=" alt=" /></p>
<p>Once I authorize and connect I am taken to a thank you page back on their website, letting me know I will be contacted shortly with any updates about the service. Oh, and I'm offered a Twitter account as well, allowing me to stay in tune with what they are up to--providing a pretty complete picture for how new API services can operate.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/schemahub_thanks.png" alt="" width="65%" align=" alt=" /></p>
<p>SchemaHub's approach reflects <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/27/github-needs-client-oauth-proxy-for-more-complete-clientside-apps-on-pages/">what I'm talking about when I say that Github should offer an Oauth service</a>, something that would enable applications running on Github to establish a Github app as part of their organization and website. I like this model because it enables connections like Schema has established to occur, maximizing the social powers of the Github platform.</p>
<p>SchemaHub wins for making a great first impression on me with their API service. Github Org, simple static Github Pages hosted website, connectivity with my Github profile, and a Twitter account to follow. Now I know who they are, I'm connected, and when they are ready with their API service, they have multiple channels to update me on. My only critique is that I would also like to have a blog with Atom feed, so I can hear stories about what they are trying to accomplish, but that is something that can come later. For now, they are off to a pretty good start.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants_%E2%80%93_making_meya_%E2%80%93_medium.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was <a href="https://medium.com/making-meya/standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants-2b89817fdff7#.6c2jfloeq">reading an interesting post on developing bots from Meya</a>, a bot platform provider, which I think describes the abstraction layer between what we are calling&nbsp;bots, and what we know as APIs. I have been trying to come up with a simple way of quantifying the point where bots and APIs work together,&nbsp;and Meya's approach to flow and intent provides me with a nice scaffolding.</p>
<p>The flow step of their bot design rationale&nbsp;provides a nice way to think about how bots will work, breaking out each step of the bot interaction in plain English.&nbsp;They use a YAML format they call Bot Flow Markup lLnguage, or BFML, to describe the flows, comparing BFML to HTML, with this definition:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">HTML is spatial, and BFML is temporal. HTML determines&nbsp;<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">where</em>&nbsp;UI exists, and BFML determines&nbsp;<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">when</em>&nbsp;UI exists.</span></em></p>
<p>The second part of their bot design rationale involves&nbsp;Intents, providing this additional definition:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>If BFML is like HTML, then intents are like URLs.</em></p>
<p>According to Meya, "intents can be keywords, regular expressions, and natural language models as you get more sophisticated". This seems to be where the&nbsp;more human aspect of what is getting done here is defined, mapping each intent to a specific flow, which can execute one or many steps to potentially satisfy the intent.</p>
<p>The third step is components, which is where the direct API connection comes clear. If you look at their example, in the component they are simply making a call to the Chuck Norris joke API, returning the results as part of the flow. Each part of the flow calls its targeted component, and each component can make a GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE to an API that provides the data, content, or algorithm behind the component.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/1_lfoybsgdnspy0i24b3dubg.png" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p>This provides me with a beginning scaffolding to think about how bot platforms are constructing the API abstraction layer behind bot activity. I will be going through other bot platforms to understand each individual napproach. Bots to me are just another endpoint for the API economy, and like mobile phones, we can have the API layer be shadowy and dark, or we can have it be more transparent and standardized, with platforms sharing their approach like Meya&nbsp;does.</p>
<p>I am picturing a world where we share open definitions of bot flows, and the intents that trigger them in YAML. &nbsp;There will be marketplaces of flows, sharing the logic behind the what is working (or not) within the bot community. These flows shouldn't be a company's secret sauce, any more than the API definitions that they employ within each function are. The secret sauce should be the data, content, and algorithms behind each API, that is called as part of any flow, designed to satisfy a specific intent.</p>
<p>When providers like Meya&nbsp;share they approach via their blog it gives me the opportunity to learn about their approach. It also gives me the opportunity to explore, and compare with the rest of my research, without having to always fire up their platform--which I do not always have the time to do (I wish I did). This helps me push forward my bot research in baby steps, derived from people who are doing interesting things in the space&nbsp;and are willing to share with the community--which is what API Evangelist is all about.</p>

<p><a href="/admin/blog/How Twitter deploys its widgets">I am learning about how Twitter deploys their </a><a href="/admin/blog/How Twitter deploys its widgets">widgets</a>. Extracting some insight for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/28/thinking-about-how-i-can-build-change-resilience-into-my-api-integrations/">my research around how we can build change resiliency into our client code</a>. As I'm doing my regular monitoring of the API space I am trying to keep an eye out for any examples from leading providers of how there are investing in client code being more change resilient. This Twitter blog post provides me with three concepts I wanted to&nbsp;add to my research:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong>&nbsp;&lsquo;Rollback first, debug later&rsquo; is our motto. Rollback should be fast, easy, and simple. Ideally, it&rsquo;s a giant red button that can get our heart rates down.</li>
<li><strong>Incremental release:</strong>&nbsp;All code has bugs and deploys have an uncanny way of surfacing them. That&rsquo;s why we wanted the ability to release new code in phases.</li>
<li><strong>Visibility:</strong>&nbsp;We need to have graphs to show how both versions of widgets.js are doing at all times. We also need the ability to drill down by country, browser type, and widget type. These graphs should be real time so we can quickly tell how a deploy is going and take action as necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are change elements that seem like they need consideration as we craft our web, mobile, device, visualization, bot, voice, and other types of API clients. These three elements should be present in the code, anywhere I'm making an API call. Being able to reverse how I'm interacting with an API, the incremental release of new API paths or changes to existing APIs, and having an analytics&nbsp;layer can contribute to helping us deal with change.</p>
<p>I think I am going to get started with an analytics layer for my own client code. Start thinking about logging the calls I'm making to any API I depend on. I have this in place for the server side of the APIs that I manage&nbsp;but do not have any sort of logging at the client level. Not only do I not have any plan for change at the client layer, I might not even know there was a change because I do not have any visibility.</p>

<p>I enjoy being able to switch gears between <a href="http://apievangelist.com">all the different areas of my API research</a>. It helps me find the interesting areas of&nbsp;overlap and potentially synchronicity&nbsp;in how APIs are being put to work. After thinking about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/29/flow-abstraction-and-intent-layer-on-top-of-apis-to-feed-the-bots/">the API abstraction layer present in Meya's&nbsp;bot platform</a>, I was <a href="http://blog.clearbit.com/announcing-the-clearbit-zapier-integration-2/">reading about Clearbit's&nbsp;iPaaS integration layer with Zapier</a>. Zaps are just like the components employed by Meya, and Clearbit walks us through delivering intended workflows with the valuable APIs they provide, executed Zapier's iPaaS service.</p>
<p>Whether its skills for voice, intents for bots, or triggers for iPaaS, an API is delivering the data, content, or algorithmic response required for these interactions. I've been pushing for API providers to be iPaaS ready, working with providers like Zapier for some time. I predict you'll hear find me showcasing examples of API providers sharing their voice and bot integration solutions, just like with Clearbit has with their iPaaS solutions, in the future.</p>
<p>I would say that even before API providers think about the Internet of Things, they should be thinking more deeply about iPaaS, voice, and bots. Not that all these areas will be relevant, or valuable to your API operations, but they should be considered. If you have the resources, they might provide you with some interesting ways to make your API more accessible to non-developers--<a href="http://blog.clearbit.com/announcing-the-clearbit-zapier-integration-2/">as Clearbit opens their blog post</a>&nbsp;opening.</p>
<p>When it comes to skills, intents, and iPaaS workflows, I am thinking we are going to have to&nbsp;be more willing to share our definitions (broken record), &nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/making-meya/standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants-2b89817fdff7#.2tbtwrhw8">like we see Meya&nbsp;doing with their <span class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">B</span>ot&nbsp;<span class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">F</span>low&nbsp;<span class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">M</span>arkup&nbsp;<span class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">L</span>anguage (BFML) in YAML</a>. I will have to do some more digging to see how Amazon is working to make <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit">Alexa Skills</a> more shareable and reusable, as well as take another look edition of the Zapier API to understand what is possible--I took a look at it back in the spring, but will need a refresher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the world of voice and bots API integration seems to be moving pretty fast, I predict it will play out much like the iPaaS world has, and take years to evolve, and stabilize. I'm still skeptical about the actual adoption of voice and bots, and it all living up to the hype, but when it comes to iPaaS I'm super hopeful about the benefits to actual humans--maybe if we consider all of these channels together, we can leverage them all equally as common tools in our API integration toolbox.</p>

After a little Googling, I see there is someone asking on <a href="ttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/34036689/example-for-deploying-a-tensorflow-model-via-a-restful-api">Stack Overflow</a>, <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!topic/discuss/00-XOWAD4S0">Google Groups</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Irtza/tensorflow_Server">a student project to tackle the need</a>. Maybe there are some other projects out there already in the works, but I couldn't find anything with 10 minutes of Googling (mad skills).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models">Google has twelve pretty compelling machine learning models available on Github</a>:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/im2txt">im2txt</a>&nbsp;-- image-to-text neural network for image captioning.</li>
</ul>
<p>That would make a pretty stellar machine learning API stack, with a simple, intuitive, RESTl wrapper. Once done it seems like there would also be a pretty big opportunity for containerized deployment of these machine learning APIs, on a wholesale basis. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/02/what-licensing-should-i-be-considering-when-i-take-open-source-software-and-offer-up-as-an-api/">I'm still not sure how the whole open source code to commercial API implementation model will work</a>, but I'm sure there is some money to made in there somewhere--at least when it comes to implementation and support.</p>
<p>I will add to the list of open source software I'd like to see have an accompanying web API, as well as containerized, or even serverless implementation. It makes me happy that Google is helping commoditize&nbsp;machine learning by open sourcing their tools, but I'd also like to see them further simplified and polished for consumption by a wider developer, or even non-developer audience, using web APIs.</p>

<p>Another story I harvested fro&nbsp;<span>a story&nbsp;by Gordon Wintrob (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/gwintrob">@gwintrob</a><span>) about how T</span><a href="https://getputpost.co/how-twilios-distributed-team-solves-developer-evangelism-c6bdb1a19212#.wmhz62h57">wilio's distributed team solves developer&nbsp;</a><a href="https://getputpost.co/how-twilios-distributed-team-solves-developer-evangelism-c6bdb1a19212#.wmhz62h57">evangelism</a>, was about how they invest in having a distributed team, providing an on the ground presence in the top cities they are looking to reach. I know this isn't something all API providers can afford, but I still think it was still an important approach worth noting.</p>
<p>Like with many other aspects of Twilio's approach, they are pretty genuine about why they invest in a distributed API evangelism team:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We also focus on interacting with the developer community where we actually live. We don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s valuable to parachute into a tech community, do an event, and then leave. We need to participate in that community and make a real impact.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I wish there was a way that smaller API providers could deliver like this. I wish we all had the resources of Twilio, but in reality, most API providers won't even be able to "parachute into a tech community", let alone have a dedicated presence there. I've seen several attempts like this fail before, so I am hesitant to say it, but I can't help but think there is an opportunity for evangelists in certain cities.</p>
<p>There isn't any startup potential here (let me make that clear), but I think there is an opportunity for developer advocates, evangelists, and would-be evangelists to band together, network, and offer up services to API providers. All you'd have to do is take the page from the Twilio&nbsp;playbook&nbsp;and execute in a decentralized way--where multiple evangelists could work together as a co-op. The trick is to bring together evangelists who actually give a shit about the space--something that would be very difficult to accomplish.</p>
<p>Anyways, just some more thoughts from my API notebook, inspired by Gordon's post. If nothing else, Twilio's approach should help guide other larger API providers, showing how important it is to invest in developers, in-person at the local level. The value brought to the table via Twilio's APIs has been key to their success, but I can't help but think a significant portion of their success has been the result of their investment at the local level.</p>

<p>After I wrote <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/08/when-working-with-our-api-make-sure-you-build-faultresistance-into-your-code/">a piece on guidance from the USGS around writing fault-resistant code when putting their API to use</a>, my friend Darrel Miller expanding on this by suggesting I include "change resilience" as part of the definition.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> I would like to see that guidance expanded to include writing change resilient client code.</p>

<p>It is something that has sat in my notebook for a couple weeks, and keeps floating up as a concept I'd like to explore further. I have some initial thoughts on what this means&nbsp;but is something that I need to write about before I grasp better. Hopefully, it will bring more suggestions about what change resilient code means to other people.</p>
<p>Ok, so off the top of my head, what elements would I consider when thinking about producing change resilient client code:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Status Codes</strong> - Making sure clients read, and pay attention to HTTP status codes used by API providers.</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia</strong> - Links are fragile, and avoiding baking them into clients makes a whole lotta sense.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Plan B API</strong> - Have a backup API identified, that can be used when the A API provider goes away.</li>
<li><strong>Circuit Breaker</strong> - Build in a circuit breaker into code that responds to specific status codes and events.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that I'm exploring, I have to ask, who's responsibility is it to build change resilience into the clients? Provider or consumer? Seems like there is a healthy responsibility on both parties? IDK. I guess we should just all be honest about how fragile the API space is, and providers should be honest with consumers when it comes to thinking about change resiliency, but ultimately API consumers have to begin to thinking more deeply&nbsp;and investing more when it comes planning for change--not just freaking out when it happens.</p>
<p>I have to admit that the code I have written as part of my API monitoring system, <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">which integrates with over 30 APIs</a>, isn't very fault or change resistant. When things break, they break. As the only user, this isn't a showstopper for me, but thinking about change is something I"m going to be considering as I kick the tires on my client. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/20/why-would-you-build-a-business-on-apis-they-are-unreliable/">While these APIs have been incredibly stable for me</a>, I can't help but listen to Darrel and want to be asking more questions when it comes to dealing with change across my API integrations.</p>

<p>I'm going through <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa">Amazon's approach to their Alexa voice services</a>, and it is making me think how bot platforms out there should be following their lead when it comes crafting their own playbook. I see voice and bots in the same way that I see web and mobile--they are just one possible integration channel for APIs. They each have their own nuances of course, but as I'm going through Amazon's approach, there are quite a few lessons on how to do it correctly here--that apply to bots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazon's approach to investment in developers on the Alexa platform and their approach to <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit">skills development</a>&nbsp;should be replicated across the bot space. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/10/investing-in-your-api-community-like-amazon-and-slack/">I know Slack has an investment fund</a>, but I don't see the skills development portion present in their ecosystem. Maybe it's in there, but it's not as prominent as Amazon's approach. Someday, I envision galleries of specific voice and bot skills <a href="https://apievangelistbots.slack.com/apps">like we have application galleries today</a>--the usefulness and modularity of these skills will be central to each provider's success (or failure).</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/25/slack-meets-the-minimum-viable-api-platform-requirements/">I had profiled Slack's approach before I left for the summer</a>, something I will need to update as it stands today. I will keep working on profiling Amazon's approach to Alexa, and put together both as potential playbook(s). I would like to eventually be able to lay them side by side and craft a common definition that could be applied in both vthe oice API, as well the bot API sector. I need to spend more time looking at the bot landscape, but currently I'm feeling like any bot platform that can emulate Amazon's approach is going to win at this game--like Amazon is doing with voice.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/plcopen_opcfoundation_opc_ua_diagram.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am spending a portion of my time each week learning about how APIs are being applied at the industrial level. An example of this can be found over at <a href="http://www.opto22.com/">Opto 22</a>, with their approach to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/15/putting-the-industrial-into-iot-with-programmable-automation-controllers-pac-apis/">using REST across their Programmable Automation Controllers (PAC)</a>. As I do with other industries I spend my time looking through the approaches&nbsp;of API pioneers in the space, which leads me to other contributing factors to why web APIs are being used to change how things are done in any industry.</p>
<p>For now, my <a href="http://industrial.apievangelist.com">industrial API research</a> is a pretty big umbrella, encompassing&nbsp;oil &amp; gas, manufacturing, and often moving into other areas I'm already tracking agriculture and energy. This approach allows me to identify companies who are leading the charge (like Opto 22), as well as specifications, tools, and other elements that are contributing to the evolution of APIs in each area--in this case, its broadly industrial usage of web APIs.</p>
<p>In my researching of industrial APIs I have come across <a href="https://opcfoundation.org/">the&nbsp;OPC format which was originally known as the Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control</a>, which is defined as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>OPC is the interoperability standard for the secure and reliable exchange of data in the industrial automation space and in </em>other<em> industries&nbsp;The OPC standard is a series of specifications developed by industry vendors, end-users and software developers. These specifications define the interface between Clients and Servers, as well as Servers and Servers, including access to real-time data, monitoring of alarms and events, access to historical data and other applications.</em></p>
<p>I'm still getting going with the world of industrial automation, but I am looking through the <a href="https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/">OPC Unified Architecture</a> to see where I can find any common definitions and schemas that could apply to industrial API design. I don't have any sense of how open these standards bodies are with their specifications, and <a href="https://backchannel.com/the-internets-own-instigator-cb6347e693b">I don't want to end up like Carl Malumud</a>, but I do want to help identify and encourage common patterns in use for industrial automation.</p>
<p>Many consumer and B2B API implementations don't get me that interested, but I find the usage of them at the industrial level often more compelling, prompting&nbsp;me to <a href="http://industrial.apievangelist.com/organizations/">add companies like Rockwell and Opto 22 to my industrial research</a>. I'm adding the OPC standard as well, and will keep working to learn which other companies are doing interesting things with industrial APIs, and the standards that are guiding, or I guess possibly hindering expansion in the usage of web APIs across the industrial landscape.</p>

<p>I wrote about my feelings that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/27/every-government-agency-should-have-a-forms-api-like-dol-does/">all government agencies should have a forms API like the Department of Labor (DOL)</a>, and I wanted to separately <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/others/faq">showcase their FAQ API</a>, and say same thing--ALL government agencies should have a frequently asked question (FAQ) API. Think about the websites and mobile applications that would benefit from ALL government agencies at the federal, state, and local level having frequently asked questions available in this way--it would be huge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a perfect world, like any good API provider, government agencies should also use their FAQ API to run their website(s), mobile, and internal systems--this way the results are always fresh, up to date, and answering the relevant questions (hopefully). I get folks in government questioning the opening up of sensitive information via APIs, but making FAQs available in a machine readable way, via the web, just makes sense in a digital world.</p>
<p>Like the <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/others/form">forms API</a>, I will be looking across other government agencies for any <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/others/faq">FAQ APIs</a>. I will be crafting an OpenAPI Spec for the DOL FAQ API (man that is a lot of acronyms). I will take any other FAQ APIs that I find and consider any additional parameters, and definitions I might want to include in a common FAQ API definition for government agencies. This is another area that should have not just a common open API and underlying schemas defined, but also a wealth of server and client side code--so any government agency can immediately put it to work in any environment.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-email.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I get a number of folks emailing me about their API and API-focused&nbsp;services. When I have the bandwidth I spend time in my inbox and respond to these emails. To help me do this a little more efficiently (I'm not always very quick about it), I'm formalizing some snippets I can use in my response(s). I want to thank them for reaching out, while also helping them understand my approach to successfully operating API Evangelist.</p>
<p>Here is one basic email I crafted today, in response to a pretty slick API provider that I will be writing about shortly:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Hi There,</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I received your email. Thanks for the kind words.&nbsp;Appreciate you introducing me to your [API / API related service]. I'm going to have to pass on the posting of the [guest post, infographic, white paper, case study, etc] to apievangelist.com, but I'm happy to keep an eye on what you are up to as part of my regular work.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I visited your site and see that you have a blog (with feed), Twitter, and a Github account. These are the channels I&rsquo;ll be keeping an eye on, and when you post a&nbsp;blog post or press release, Tweet something out, or I see a Github repo or commit of interest, I'll definitely include in my research, and craft a story for the blog.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">I have also added your company, blog, feed, twitter, and Github accounts to my monitoring system. Keep on doing interesting things with APIs and I'll make sure it becomes part of my storytelling in the space.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>So far, and reviewing your web site and developer, your API efforts [looked pretty polished / could use some work / is not very modern] I&rsquo;ll keep digging around and publish anything interesting that I find.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Thanks!</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Kin Lane<br />@kinlane</em></p>
<p class="p1">This is a basic template I will use moving forward. I'll tweak it some for each response, but ultimately I am trying to keep thing consistent with folks who are emailing with me. I'm not trying to be less personal with folks, but as I work to scale API Evangelist, and keep things operating as smoothly as they have been since I returned, I need to automate things a bit.</p>
<p class="p1">This approach also helps encourage API providers to standardize how they interface with the world and helps underline that having a blog, feed, Twitter, and Github accounts makes sense in 2016. I can pay attention to more companies this way, and companies should be able to more successfully communicate with their developers, the general public, and analysts like me with this approach</p>

<p>I'm building what I am calling "micro tools", that run 100% on Github. To push my work forward <a href="https://kinlane.github.io/github-micro-tool/">I developed a base template I can use for deploying apps that run 100% on Github, using Github Pages, the Github API, and Github OAuth as the engine</a>. As a next step I wanted to develop a simple YAML editor that run on Github, allowing me to edit the YAML core of each tool, that is stored in the _data folder for each Jekyll site I host on Github Pages.</p>
<p>The key to all of this working securely is <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">Github personal access tokens</a>, which every Github user has in their accounts under settings. I have employed this approach to running apps on Github Pages before using <a href="http://OAuth.io">OAuth.io as the broker</a>, something that works very well, and I highly recommend it. I have also run using my own Github OAuth proxy, where I had server side code that would do the OAuth dance for me, when authenticating via these apps. The problem is I want them to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">run 100% on Github</span>, and be forkable by anyone, leaving personal access tokens as my only option.</p>
<p>What would really rock, is if Github provide us with a solution to client-side authentication via the Github API. We can already accomplish the hole thing, we just need Github to offer the same functionality that OAuth.io -- heck I recommend you just buy them and implement. An increasing number of API providers are managing their API operations on Github. From API portal, to documentation and SDKS--they are using Github and Github Pages to take care of business. So having Github OAuth, plus authentication via other providers would be a huge benefit.</p>
<p>Additionally, it would open up Github Pages to be more than just static project pages--they could become little mini apps, or micro tools as I call them. Forking one of my micro tools, then finding your personal access tokens is not that high of a bar, but it would be much nicer if I could just provide them a Github icon, and I could route them through a secure Github OAuth proxy, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all without any outside infrastructure</span>. Just a thought Github. Some ramblings about what I'd like to see. For now, I'll rely on the personal access tokens, that is until Github decides to provide us with some sort of OAuth proxy for client-side apps to operate on Github Pages.</p>

<p><span>The API returns some valuable details about each agency from including OMB number, URL, file extension, file size, and other meta information like a description, tags, and revision. I know that many in the API community would like all forms to be APIs, but I would be happy if we just started by making the concept of a forms API default across all government agencies first.</span></p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-design-empathy.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>My friend Matthew Reinbold wrote a great post on his blog asking "<a href="http://voxpop.co/go.cfm?article=What_if_Developers_Arent_Meant_to_Do_API_Design">what if developers aren't meant to do API design</a>"? I think he is touching on an important aspect of why DevOps might not work everywhere in the same expected ways. We all have our strengths, and we all have our weaknesses, and I agree with him that maybe we are asking too much of our developers--API design might not be their strength.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the owner of a small business operated by one person (me), DevOps is hard. I cannot do everything myself, and require a variety of services to help me out, but I still hit areas where I'm deficient like graphic design and editing. I'm getting better at editing, but my graphic design skills never seem to evolve at all. I would like to think I can do everything, but I can't, and if I had a job at a large organization, and was expected to learn every piece of a modern stack--I'm not sure I could do it.</p>
<p>Bringing it back to the API design, though, the question of who does API design still needs to be answered. It can't just be left behind because a developer of an API doesn't have the chops. Ideally, a company could afford to hire an API designer and architect to come in and work their magic, but I know in&nbsp;reality this isn't going to happen within many organizations--so what can be done?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>API Design In Our Tools &amp; Services -</strong> Developers use language and platform specific&nbsp;IDE functionality as a crutch, we need the same enablement for API design in leading API design tools and services. This is why <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/api-stylebook-a-collections-of-resources-for-api-designers/">projects like the API design stylebook are so important</a>&nbsp;because they begin to provide us with the definitions that are needed to drive the advancements.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing Of Common API Patterns -</strong> I feel like such a nag on this subject, but we need to share the common API patterns more. If you are using HAL or Siren, share the story and definition of your approach. If you have OpenAPI Spec or API Blueprint, make them available. If you are a developer, go out and do a little discvoery of existing patterns before you get to work--you don't need to be expert, but do a little homework first.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing of Common Data Patterns -</strong> This exists in the form of <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>. Don't reinvent the wheel when it comes to your underlying schema. Even if you are mapping to completely whacky shit behind, use common definitions on the front. Again, API design tooling and services need to pipe these into your solutions, here are all the OpenlAPI specs for Schema.or to get you going. ;-)</li>
</ol>
<p>These three areas can help augment developers when API design is just not their cup of tea. After that, and short of hiring an API design professionals, developers who are touching on the API layers are just going to have to step up and develop some empathy. I think API design is part science (specs, schema, patterns), and part empathy of everyone who will come in contact with that API. I don't require all developers understand hypermedia or REST, but they damn sure should be required to put some thought into who is going to be developing against the API and consuming it--otherwise they shouldn't be developing an API in the first place.</p>
<p>Coming full circle, I guess this could be an argument for GraphQL right? If you can't find developers who get API design, you can't hire an API professional, and for some reason they are empathy-challenged, you can provide a GraphQL layer that allows developers to get at what they need. IDK. This is one of the reasons I like web APIs (not just REST), is that it allows for this bridging of the often very technical backend, with the often very human interface on the front-end, but I guess it also takes a willingness on developers to empathize with the fact that this exists and are willing to do a little extra work.</p>

I'm going to be going through the APIs track on, looking for different variations of this, but before I did this I wanted to explore a couple of approaches I already had rattling around in my head.</p>
<p>What if, when you first sign up for API access you only get access to your own data, and content? You couldn't get access to any other users until you were approved. It seems like something that would incentivize developers to publish data and content, build their profiles out, which is good for the platform right? It will also protect other end-users from malicious activity by random developers who are just looking to wreak havoc in support of their own objectives and do not care about the platform--like we saw with Soundcloud.</p>
<p>A good example of how this could be applied is evident in&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@krisshaffer/getting-data-out-of-medium-8b8b318057c3#.t2x6wlrls">the post yesterday by Kris Shaffer on Medium, who was looking to get his content out of the platform</a>. I use <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/22/syndicating-api-evangelist-posts-to-medium-using-their-api/">the Medium API to syndicate blog posts to Medium</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSEE</a>), but there is no read API allowing me to pull my content out--I agree with Kris, this is a problem. What if Medium opened up API access, allowing us platform users to get at our own content, but then required approval of any app before there ever is access to other users content?</p>
<p>Some food for thought. I hear a lot of platforms say they don't do APIs because they don't want to end up with the same problems as Twitter. I think this is the result of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/19/putting-the-concept-of-the-public-api-to-rest-as-a-dominant-narrative/">some legacy views about public APIs that should just go away</a>. Not all APIs are created equal, and I feel that APIs shouldn't always be just about applications, and often times <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/29/apis-are-not-just-meant-for-killer-apps-they-can-also-be-a-lifeline-for-users/">are just a lifeline for platform users</a>, helping us end-users better manage their data and content. If my internal systems&nbsp;and other 3rd party systems are integrated together with APIs, the likelihood I will grow dependent on the integration only increases.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/26/taking-another-look-at-the-department-of-labor-api-efforts/">Taking Another Look At The Department Of Labor API Efforts</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">26 Sep 2016</span>
        <p>Someone asked me about the current state of the <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/">Department of Labors (DOL) API efforts the other day</a>, and since I hadn't actually taken a look in a few months I wanted to spend some time in there seeing what they have going on. There is no better way to get a feel for what a government agency is up to than going through their API efforts--the DOL is pretty ahead of the game in this area.</p>
<p>The vibe when you land on <a href="http://developer.dol.gov">developer.dol.gov</a> (which is a great subdomain) is nice. It is clean&nbsp;and has all the links that I am looking for, providing access to their APIs, as well as supporting code, while allowing you to ask questions and report bugs.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/developer_dol_gov__united_states_department_of_labor_developer_portal.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>One thing I think is interesting in their approach is that they efficiently <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/sdk/">use Github in support of their code</a>, apply <a href="https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/ask?tags=labor">Stack Exchange in support of asking questions</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/Developer/issues/new">employ Github issues for reporting bugs</a>. I understand that government agencies do not always have the resources necessary to support their API efforts, so this approach seems sensible to me when providing the minimum viable support for an API.</p>
<p>The Department of Labor provides a number of APIs which provide access to some key economic data, broken down into four separate categories</p>

<p>There is a wealth of valuable economic data available in there. I am not a fan of their API design patterns, I get the same feeling&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/25/taking-a-look-at-whats-next-for-the-environmental-protection-agency-epa-envirofacts-data-service-api/">like I did from Environment Protection Agency</a>--that the information is accessible (yay), but it isn't all the intuitive when it comes to finding everything that is in there. They provide you with an <a href="https://devtools.dol.gov/APISampler/Home/Index1">API sampler</a>, that lets you play with the APIs using a form, but I'd prefer some more investment in the overall design to simplify and make intuitive on the&nbsp;first click.</p>
<p>While I feel a lot more could be invested in API design to make DOL's data more accessible, they are way ahead of other agencies like the VA, so I'll take what I can get. They are also using actively Github, which I think is super promising. The quick look has provided me with a fresh mental image of what the DOL is up to with their APIs, and provided the seeds for a couple other stories--so it was a success. One project I'd like to also play with if I have the time is to see if I can <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/others/api-metadata">auto generate an OpenAPI Spec from the DOL metadata API</a>, and help autogenerate some docs that could help shed light on the wealth of data available within the federal government API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-share-stack.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am perpetually working to publish all of my API definitions <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack">my API Stack Github repository</a>, with <a href="http://theapistack.com/">the front available as the API Stack</a>. I regularly push the latest copies of all of my OpenAPI Specs to these Github repos when I have time, but my OpenAPI Specs are far from complete, and are&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/02/working-to-establish-a-complete-openapi-spec-for-leading-apis/">something I'm always working to make as complete as a I can, and certify when possible</a>.</p>
<p>My primary objective around defining APIs using OpenAPI Spec is all about <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a>, and understanding the request and response surface area for many of the publicly available APIs out there today. Secondarily I'm interested in actually putting these API definitions to use across the API lifecycle in <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">management</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">testing</a>, <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">virtualization</a>, and <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/organizations/">client tools and services</a>.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of work to certify an API definition as complete--a process best executed by the API owner. In the absence of this, I am trying to fill in the gap(s) where I can, but as a one-person operation, I only&nbsp;have so much bandwidth. I have had people ask me if I'd focus on specific APIs they are interested in having, and even have some folks pay me for this work, but what really surprises me is the number of emails, DMs, and Github requests I get from folks telling me about how incomplete they are, and the low number of folks who ever contribute back by sharing their definitions with me.</p>
<p>People really enjoy emailing me to tell me my API definitions are incomplete, but they rarely&nbsp;fork&nbsp;and contribute back any API definitions to my work--even though I regularly ask people if they could (at the very least submit an issue with URL to where it exists on your server). I feel like this is the general tone of the space that has been set by VC investment and unhealthy views of intellectual property defined by companies like Oracle and Google. People are perfectly happy building on the open work other folks do, but very rarely ever give back and share the API definitions that they have in their own collections.</p>
<p>Hypermedia visionaries are often frustrated because people refuse to emulate <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/tools/">the best patterns currently available</a>, and that OpenAPI Spec is just a bridge. My concerns are more that we can't even get people to walk across the bridge to greener pastures because the greedy nature of the space is more focused on scrapping and keeping parts and pieces of the bridge for themselves, leaving it as something nobody will walk across. Let alone getting us to the place where we all share and follow a common set of API and schema patterns across all industries.</p>
<p>Please share your API definitions, it doesn't have to be part of <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack work</a>, but please make them easily found within your API portal.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_algorithmic_sovereignty.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have showcased&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/05/your-api-access-replicated-into-multiple-regions-around-the-globe-for-additional-charge/">examples of API providers allowing you to deploy your API into various regions around the world like Algolia does</a>, but it is a topic that I think will keep gaining traction as data, content, or algorithmic sovereignty continues to be a privacy, security, or regulatory concern. As the Internet continues to evolve, people and companies are only going to continue being concerned&nbsp;and dare I say become nationalistic about where they digital worlds exist and operate.</p>
<p>When I Google "data sovereignty" I get:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Data sovereignty is the concept that information which has been converted and stored in binary digital form is subject to the laws of the country in which it is located.</em></p>
<p>Where data is stored tends to dominate conversations historically, but I think that increasingly algorithmic sovereignty will become a concern as well. With more platforms employing algorithms at almost every level of operation, at some point where they are operating is going to come into play (ie. the Facebook news feed algorithm might have to have different considerations in the US than it does in EU).</p>
<p>The DNS layer is the first place to start when validating where data is being stored, or an algorithm is being executed, and which rules apply. After that I'd guess that we will need the API layer to help us also broker this, ensuring that web, mobile, and device based clients can articulate&nbsp;where data should be stored, and which algorithms&nbsp;or variations of algorithms can be applied.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the growth in regional specific cloud storage and compute solutions this doesn't seem like it will be too difficult to implement, but I'm sure will take a significant amount of time to standardize how API providers actually get it done. I'll keep looking for examples of it in the wild, and contribute to how we can better validate and ensure data and algorithmic sovereignty at the API layer.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/api-sign-up-changes"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/backstage_blog__api_sign_up_changes__soundcloud_developers.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/api-sign-up-changes">SoundCloud recently made changes to the signup process for their API</a> and are now requiring approval before any 3rd party developer can get an API key and access the&nbsp;API. While I encourage API providers to be as open and transparent with their API portal, documentation, and other resources, I honestly can't criticize&nbsp;API providers for locking down APIs and requiring approval--especially when 3rd party developers can be so badly behaved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modern API management solutions allow for API providers to decide how open they want to be with their APIs, and while there are many benefits for having an open presence for an API portal, documentation, and other resources, I predict that many API providers will require approval before you get full access to resources in the future. Especially if it impacts the end user experience in a negative way like it was on SoundCloud.</p>
<p>I support SoundCloud's decision because&nbsp;they kept their overall operations public and because&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/api-sign-up-changes">they shared the decision so transparently on their blog</a>. This type of transparent, communicative approach is important to helping set the tone for the API community&nbsp;and prevent any backlash from developers. There really is no reason API providers have to be 100% open with the data, content, and algorithms &nbsp;thatthey are providing access to, and I think SoundCloud's approach provides a basic model that other providers can consider when they are thinking about exactly how "open" they want to be.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com">I was adding dreamfactory as one of my sponsors</a>&nbsp;today. I have them in my in my API monitoring system already, so I have a logo for them, but whenever there is a significant event involving one of the companies I keep an eye on in the API space, I tend to make sure I have an update to date version of their logo. In the case of adding them as a sponsor I definitely want the latest logo--so I did what I always do, I Googled "dreamfactory logo".</p>
<p>A while back&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/01/why-do-companies-who-ask-me-to-update-their-logo-never-have-branding-page/">I wrote about how companies who ask me to update their logo on my site(s) almost never have a dedicated logo page</a>--which might have helped make sure I have had the right logo in the first place. &nbsp;So when I Googled the&nbsp;dreamfactory&nbsp;logo", I was pleased to find <a href="https://www.dreamfactory.com/logos">tthe dreamfactory logo page as the first result,</a> with a wealth of logos for me to select from.</p>
<p>I can't imagine why logo and branding pages are default for all companies, but I'll focus on making sure API service providers, as well as API providers, invest in this area (by writing about whenever I can). When you open up your data, content, and algorithms to 3rd party developers it just makes sense to have logo assets easy available, allowing them to provide attribution. It also makes sense to have a logo and branding so that journalists, bloggers, and analysts like me can get the most up to date assets as possible, for&nbsp;use in our storytelling.</p>

<p>As I'm <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-150/sp800_150_second_draft.pdf">processing some guidelines around the importance of sharing data</a> in the <a href="http://cybersecurity.theater">cybersecurity.theater</a> a story <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/09/20/494765472/regulating-self-driving-cars-for-safety-even-before-theyre-built">on NPR came on the radio about the importance of data sharing when it comes to the emerging self-driving car marketing</a>. I do API Evangelist, not to encourage everyone to do APIs and be the next Twitter, it is to help everyone understand the important of sharing machine-readable&nbsp;information in a secure and accessible way, to make all industries healthier, secure, and more viable environments for digital transformation (man I hate that phrase).</p>
<p>APIs are about sharing information in machine readable formats like YAML, JSON, and XML. Modern approaches to API deployment and management makes this information available in a self-service, secure way, ensuring those who should have access do, in a 24/7, always-on environment. Sharing cybersecurity threat information, and sharing of real-world and laboratory data around self-driving cars fall into this area, and APIs should be a&nbsp;default for anyone playing in these industries.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/03/making-scientific-research-more-real-time-and-collaborative-using-apis/">We are seeing API efforts emerge for expediting Zika virus research, by sharing machine-readable data that other researchers can put to work in their own efforts, without reinventing the wheel and duplicating work within many separate silos</a>--we need more of this in other industries. If you need a primer&nbsp;on how APIs can be put to work in your industry feel free to reach out to me. APIs are not the next vendor solution, and if someone is telling you this, you should run the other direction. APIs are about sensibly, and securely sharing critical information by default across your organization, and industry, using low-cost web technology--not buying the next product or service.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/sunlight_foundation_transparency.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/23/identifying-the-important-work-from-the-sunlightfoundation-i-would-like-to-see-live-on/">As I work through the APIs, and Github repositories of soon to be gone Sunlight Foundation</a>, I wanted to take some more time to help open data and API efforts realize the important of real-time transparency and openness of their projects--specifically how Github can help contribute to this. I'm super stoked at <a href="https://github.com/sunlightlabs/">the number of projects on Sunlight Lab's Github account</a>, but after identifying the actual gaps between what is there and what is available in their APIs, I want to emphasize the importance of doing our work out in the open on Github when working on these types of projects.</p>
<p>In short, it is really&nbsp;difficult to package up any project once the hammer comes down, and a company or individuals are moving on. You'll never be as thorough with sharing the data, code, and the story behind as if you did in real-time, while&nbsp;in the moment. Even if the lights aren't being shut off, it is extremely difficult to remember all the details after the fact--which is why I am an extreme advocate for being transparent by default throughout the life of any open data and API projects in the service of government transparency.</p>
<p>Many technologists see sharing your work as it happens as extra work, but in my experience, it is actually the opposite, even before you come up against circumstances where you have to recreate work after the fact. Technologists also tend to view Github as purely for managing open source code, when in reality it can be used for much, much more. After reviewing the Sunlight Foundation's Github repo, here are few area that come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data</strong> - Publishing raw JSON and YAML data, as part of regular updates, including backups in native database format (ie. MySQL, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Server Code</strong> - Using Github to manage all server side code for APIs, with regular commits as the code evolves and changes.</li>
<li><strong>Scraping Code</strong> - Making sure all libraries and code used as part of data and content scraping is shared on Github.</li>
<li><strong>Client /Frontend Code</strong> - This is the most common thing currently with providers, with the sharing of client libraries on Github</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations</strong> - Publishing of data behind, and the JavaScript <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/20/d3js-visualizations-using-yaml-and-jekyll/">code for all visualization like I'm doing with D3.js</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Storytelling</strong> - Jekyll on Github pages provides an easy, free way to publish a blog which can be used to tell the story in real-time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything that runs API Evangelist exists on Github. This approach has fed <a href="http://adopta.agency/">my Knight Foundation funded Adopta.Agency work</a>. If you want to see an&nbsp;<a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/adopta-blueprint/">example of what I'm talking about check out the Adopta.Agency Blueprint</a>. It is much easier to make sure all of your work will live on beyond your organization or project's lifespan, if you are publishing your work in real time on Github in this way. If you are using Github to manage your daily data, code, visualizations, and storytelling--you will be transparent by default, no extra work necessary.</p>
<p>No project is immune to what has happened with the Sunlight Foundation. All open data and API projects will go away some day, and if we are going to keep building on each other's work it should happen out in the open, in real time, in a way that anyone can fork. I'm not even touching on the zero costs associated with publishing using Github--which I identified when working on open data efforts for the White House, where I couldn't stand up any hosting environment, but I damn sure could stand up a Github repository. I'm not even talking about the social benefits of doing this in real-time&nbsp;and attracting other key actors and players to your work even before it done. I'm just talking about doing this for the benefits of when the lights are dimmed or shut off completely as they are with the Sunlight Foundation.</p>
<p>I know there has been a lot of rhetoric, both good and bad about using Github in government, but the benefits are real, and this type of work around open data and APIs is too important to ignore. If you need help understanding what I'm talking about, needing open data or API efforts rescued, or specific Github templates developed like my <a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/adopta-blueprint/">Adopta.Agency blueprint</a>, feel free to reach out. I'm hoping to carve off some cycles to apply my approach to the existing Sunlight Foundation projects, helping keep them alive, as well as teach this approach to other upcoming open data and API efforts, to help ensure the work lives on.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Sep 2016</span>

<p class="p1">I am saddened to hear <a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/09/20/statement-from-sunlight-foundations-board-chairman/">the news of the Sunlight Foundation dimming the lights on their important work around government transparency</a>. They have provided me a constant spotlight on government activity, and provide a model for me when it comes to opening up government data, and providing APIs that can make a difference. Having helped run non-profit organizations, working to make social change, I know this can be a very difficult thing to keep above water.</p>
<p class="p2">I have already reached out to the Sunlight foundation staff letting them know I'm here to help with any API related projects, and happy to fund their existence until I can find a suitable, caring adoption situations for them. First up, I wanted to make sure and <a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/api/">go through their APIs</a>, and make sure there is a current <a href="https://openapis.org/specification">OpenAPI Specification</a> snapshot for each one, in case they get shuttered:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://sunlightlabs.github.io/Capitol-Words/">Capital Words API</a></strong> - The Capitol Words API is an API allowing access to the word frequency count data powering the Capitol Words project.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/">Congress API v3</a></strong> - A live JSON API for the people and work of Congress. Information on legislators, districts, committees, bills, votes, as well as real-time notice of hearings,&nbsp;</li>
<li>floor activity and upcoming bills.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://sunlightlabs.github.io/openstates-api/">Open States API</a></strong> - Information on the legislators and activities of all 50 state legislatures, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://sunlightlabs.github.io/partytime-docs/">Political Party Time API</a></strong> - Provides access to the underlying, raw data that the Sunlight Foundation creates based on fundraising invitations collected in Party Time. As we enter information on new invitations, the database updates automatically.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://sunlightlabs.github.io/realtime-docs/">Real-Time Federal Campaign Finance API</a></strong> - A JSON and CSV API that delivers up-to-the-minute campaign finance information on federal candidates, committees, PACs and other groups that file electronically with the Federal Election Commission. Summary information for Senate candidate committees, which file on paper, is available as soon as they have been digitized by the FEC.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">Next, I wanted to go through <a href="https://github.com/sunlightlabs">their Github repositories</a> and identify any repos that contained data, server, and client code that is API related. In doing this I also found some interesting visualizations built on top of their work, that I think are worthy of showcasing and preserving:</p>

</ul>
<p>I only went back to 2013 looking for projects in the Sunlight Foundation Github account, because I felt if it hasn't been updated or touched in that time, I probably won't have time to touch it myself. In addition to visualizations, going through their Github account showed me that there is also some interesting scraping work that should also be targeted for keeping alive, as well as open data, API, and visualization projects.</p>
<p class="p1">There is a lot of amazing work present in the Sunlight Foundation APIs and Github repositories. I am just as bummed as many of the comments on their blog, and via the Twittersphere express (some friendly, and some not so friendly), but having worked for the White House, and lived in the world of APIs for the last six years I know that nothing is permanent, and all good things will go away in time--usually due to budgetary and investment scenarios. None of it stops me from doing the hard work that needs to be done, and there is still a lot more to occur around the Sunlight Foundation.</p>

<p>I am always fascinated by the online fence sitting persona that is the enterprise tech industry employee. I know many them are there, but few ever retweet my work, respond to my posts via comments, or other channels. Usually, I only know that many of them are there from the occasional&nbsp;like on one of my stories, but I'm slowly developing other ways to build lists of Twitter users from behind the enterprise fence.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to root them out is to write positive stories about their company, products, group, or their flagship clients. When you do this many of the no names, no description Twitter accounts for the enterprise fence sitters will come out of the woodworks. They can't help themselves it seems, when someone writes positively about what they are doing, as many are so starved for genuine praise, they will often retweet a story revealing themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not believe that everyone should be as open and transparent as I am online. Especially if you have a boss breathing down your neck. Though I do like to know that you are there and that I occasionally write things you like. I would also enjoy more signals from you about what is important to you out in the space, and which topics impact your success in the enterprise trenches. You are always welcome to drop me a line via email if you don't feel comfortable talking out loud, or DM now that I have triangulated&nbsp;your Twitter account and followed you.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-storytelling.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I come across a number of really useful stories about APIs in my regular monitoring of the space that can't seem to separate the solution their product delivers from the product itself. I get that you want people to know that your product does the really useful thing that you are telling the story about, but I want to help you understand that they are most likely turning people off to the solution by tightly coupling the solution story with your product and company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This type of storytelling is more sales than it is evangelism. It shows you don't really have a good product in my opinion. If you can't talk endless about what your product accomplishes without mentioning the product name or the company behind, you probably don't have much of a thing in the first place. However, I'm guessing in many cases you just do not have the storytelling experience, both reading, and writing, to understand the difference, and that is why I want to help you reach more people.</p>
<p>I know your boss is telling you to sell, sell, sell, and that you need to make your "numbers". The reality though is people are being sold, sold, sold to all the time, and they really need actual solutions for problems they face and they appreciate the companies who focus on solutions, not yet just another vendor solution to be bombarded with. If you are going to take the time to craft content for your blog, Medium, or other popular channels, then take the time to thoughtfully disconnect your solution from the product--if you do it well, people will know it is you, and find the product or company behind, when they are ready to implement your solution.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/the_github_graphql_api__github_engineering.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/30/graphql-seems-like-we-do-not-want-to-do-the-hard-work-of-api-design/">I wrote a skeptical piece the other day about GraphQL</a>, which I followed up with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/02/i-am-keeping-my-mind-open-and-looking-forward-to-learning-more-about-graphql/">another post saying I would keep an open mind</a>. I've added GraphQL to my regular monitoring of the space, but I don't have its own research area yet, but if the conversation keeps expanding I will. A recent expansion in the GraphQL conversation for me was <a href="http://githubengineering.com/the-github-graphql-api/">Github releasing the GitHub GraphQL API</a>.</p>
<p>In the release blog&nbsp;post, from Github they provide exactly what I'm looking for in the GraphQL conversation--<a href="http://githubengineering.com/the-github-graphql-api/#why">the reasons why they&nbsp;chose to start supporting GraphQL</a>. In their post Github&nbsp;describes some of the challenges API consumers were having with the existing API, which led them down the GraphQL path:</p>
<ul>
<li>sometimes required two or three separate calls to assemble a complete view of a resource</li>
<li>responses simultaneously sent too many data and didn&rsquo;t include data that consumers needed</li>
</ul>
<p>They also talk about some of what they wanted to accomplish:</p>
<ul>
<li>wanted to identify the OAuth scopes required for each endpoint</li>
<li>wanted to be smarter about how our resources were paginated</li>
<li>wanted assurances of type-safety for user-supplied parameters</li>
<li>wanted to generate documentation from our code</li>
<li>wanted to generate clients</li>
</ul>
<p>Github says they <em>"studied a variety of API specifications built to make some of this easier, but we found that none of the standards totally matched our requirements"</em> and felt that <em>"GraphQL represents a massive leap forward for API development. Type safety, introspection, generated </em>documentation <em>and predictable responses benefit both the maintainers and consumers of our platform"</em>. Some interesting points to consider, as I work to understand the benefits GraphQL brings to the table.</p>
<p>I'm still processing the entire story behind their decision to go GraphQL, and will share any more thoughts I'm having in future blog posts. With this major release from Github, I am now keeping an eye out for other providers who are headed in this direction. Hopefully, they will be as transparent about their reasons why as Github has--this kind of storytelling around API design and deployment is important for the rest of the API community to learn from.</p>

<p>Now that I have API Evangelist up to regular levels of operation after a summer break, I'm working to expand where I publish my content, and next up on the list is Medium. Like many other popular destinations I refuse to completely depend on Medium for my blogging presence, but I recognize the network effects, and I'm more than happy to syndicate my work there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help me manage the publishing of my stories to Medium I wired up the <a href="https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs">Medium API</a> into my API monitoring and publishing platform. I use the Github API to publish blog posts to API Evangelist, Kin Lane, and API.Report, and it is pretty easy to add a layer that will publish select stories to Medium as well. All I have to do is tag posts in a certain way, and my "scheduler" and the Medium API does the rest.</p>
<p>I will be evaluating which of my stories go up to Medium on an individual basis. I'm not wanting everything to go there, but would like to open up some of my work for discussion on the platform. While I already share my API Evangelists posts to LinkedIn and Facebook, I will also be syndicating select stories using <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/47445/long-form-posts-on-linkedin-overview?lang=en">LinkedIn Publishing</a> and <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2015/09/22/instant-articles-from-CMS/">Facebook Instant Articles</a>&nbsp;next. I will only be publishing my content to platforms that bring value, but more importantly have APIs so I can retain as much control over my work from a central location within my domain.</p>

<p><a href="http://branding.apievangelist.com/">I am tracking on the approaches of API providers who have branding&nbsp;world together when it comes to platform operations</a>. I'm always surprised at how few API providers actually have anything regarding branding in place, especially when it seems like loss of&nbsp;brand control, attribution, and other concerns seem to be at the top of everyone's list.</p>
<p>I was hooking up the <a href="https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs">Medium API</a> to my API monitoring and publishing system, syndicating select stories of mine to the platform and found myself thinking about how important an API branding strategy is (should be) to content platforms like them. Medium doesn't let you pull posts via the API (yet), but if it did, I would make sure branding and attribution was&nbsp;default.</p>
<p>Few API providers have their API brand strategy together, let alone provide easy to understand&nbsp;and find assets to support the strategy. It seems like to me that if you are concerned about brand control, or just want to really extend your brand across all websites and mobile applications where your API resources are put to use, you would want to bake branding and attribution into the API response itself, as well as a robust branding area of the developer portal.</p>
<p>I'm going to explore concepts around branding and attribution as a default layer of API access. Everything from thinking about hypermedia approaches to providing link relations, to maybe <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/02/http-header-awareness-using-the-link-header-for-pagination/">including link relations in the header like Github does with pagination</a>, but using branding and attribution focused link relations. I would like to be able to provide light footprint options that may not require changing up the JSON response, or add an entirely new media type.</p>
<p>When Medium does open up /GET for posts on the platform, I'd be stoked if there were branding and attribution elements present, driven by settings in my account. I'm not under the delusion that every developer who makes a call to an API will respect branding guidelines, but if it is front and center with every API call, and easy to implement, the chances increase dramatically.</p>
<p>Anyways, some food for thought around branding. I will push this topic forward as I have time&nbsp;and maybe play with a prototype for the API Evangelist&nbsp;blog. I'd love for consumers and syndicators of my content to be able to extend the reach of my brand, or at least send some love my way with a little attribution.</p>

<p>I was watching my partner in crime Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) build the <a href="https://twitter.com/weaponizedu">weaponized edu Twitter bot</a> using a Google Spreadsheet as an engine.<a href="http://www.zachwhalen.net/posts/how-to-make-a-twitter-bot-with-google-spreadsheets-version-04/"> Something she learned from Zach Whalen, a professor at University of Mary Washington</a>. Audrey is not a programmer, but she has become extremely&nbsp;proficient at building these little bots, and using the Twitter API--demonstrating the potential of Google Sheets as an engine for an API-driven bot solutions, or in this case bot mayhem.</p>
<p>Zach's approach is extremely well defined--you will have to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cbg_6pYN04XtDHpDLtxAP3ExQEBL8PYBXBQ1E5_Sq30/copy">copy and go through the spreadsheet yourself to see</a>. Everything you need to get the job done is there, from step by step instructions, to storing your API tokens, and planting the seeds for your bot intelligence. This is the kind of API stuff I'm always talking about when I say that API shouldn't just be for developers--all it takes is having no fear of APIs, and well laid out blueprints like Zach has provided.</p>
<p>It is an approach I'd like to explore more as I have time. I'm not a big fan of the spreadsheet but I fully get its role amongst muggle society. Spreadsheets keep me fascinated because of the many dimensions of API they possess. Spreadsheets can provide APIs, consume APIs, and as Zach's approach to bot development demonstrates, they can be a pretty serious engine for driving API goodness.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_boost_incentives.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm expanding on my <a href="http://branding.apievangelist.com/">API branding research</a>, putting some thought into <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/22/providing-branding-and-attribution-assets-with-each-api-response/">how we might be able to include branding and attribution in API responses</a>. Next, I'd like to brainstorm ways to incentivize both API providers, as well as API consumers to employ sensible branding practices. You'd think API providers would be all over this stuff, but for some reason, they seem to need as much encouragement, and structure as API consumers do--this is why I'm wanting to explore how I can drive both sides.</p>
<p>First, why do I care about branding when it comes to APIs? Well, the more successful companies are with their APIs, the more their companies brand can be not just protected, but enhanced--the more APIs are seen in a positive light, rather than the threat to brand control that is often cast on them. And, the more APIs we have, the more access to valuable data and content for use in web, and mobile applications.</p>
<p>While there are many nuances to API branding, it often centers around making text, link, and image assets available&nbsp;for developers to use wherever they put API driven data, content, and algorithms to use. APIs have many different approaches to branding requirements and enforcement, but few actually provide rich assets and tooling to support a coherent branding strategy. All it takes is a handful of logos, some JavaScript APIs, and guidance for developers, and branding can significantly extend the reach of any brand--not hurt it as many perceive an API will do.</p>
<p>The benefits of branding to API provider are clear for me, but I'd like to explore what we can do to incentivize API consumers. What if, with all the tracking of where branding and attribution are deployed (aka API brand reach), we tracked each domain or subdomain, as well as each impression of text, logos, and other assets? &nbsp;What if network reach and brand exposure could buy me API credits, and raise my API rate limits as a consumer? I mean, as a developer I'm potentially extending the reach of your brand, providing you with valuable exposure, and potentially inbound links and traffic--if I am rewarded for doing this, the chances I execute healthy API branding practices will ony increase.</p>
<p>Just some thoughts on incentivizing both the API provider and consumer sides of the coin when it comes to API branding. I am going to play around with a design for a simple set of logos and JavaScript APIs for supporting API branding assets. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/22/providing-branding-and-attribution-assets-with-each-api-response/">I'm going to also play around with baking in links to these resources within API responses either as JSON collections or present in headers</a>. Once in place, I'll have a better idea of the type of data I can collect, and how it can possibly be measured, and applied to increasing API rate limits or possible equal credits for API access--all things I know developers will want.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more on API branding in coming weeks...</p>

<p>People love to tell me the limitations of my usage of the acronym API. They like to point out they were around before the web, that they are used in hardware, or are not an API unless it is REST. There are endless waves of dudes who like to tell me what I mean when I say API. To help counter-balance&nbsp;each wave I like to regularly&nbsp;evolve, and share what I mean when I say API--not what people might interpret I mean.</p>
<p>When I say API, I am talking about exposing data, content, or algorithm as an interface for programmatic use in other applications via web technology. Application in "Application Programming Interface" means any "application" to me, not just a software application. Consider visualizations, image rendering, bots, devices, or any other way that web technology is being applied in 2016.</p>
<p>I do not mean REST when I say API. I do not mean exclusively dynamic&nbsp;APIs--it could simply be a JSON &nbsp;data store &nbsp;made available via a Github repo. If machine-readable data, content, and algorithms are being accessed using web technology for use in any application, in a programmatic way--I'm calling it API. You may have your own interpretations, and be bringing your own API baggage along for the ride, but this is what I'm talking about when you hear me say API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/psa_group_for_developers_api_for_connected_cars_peugeot_citroen_and_ds_automobiles.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was turned on to <a href="https://developer.psa-peugeot-citroen.com/">the API program out of&nbsp;Groupe PSA</a>, &nbsp;the French multinational manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles sold under the Peugeot, Citro&euml;n and DS Automobiles brands from a friend online the other day. Rarely do I just generally showcase an API provider, but I think their approach is simple, clean, and a nice start for a major automobile brand, and worthwhile to take note of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies of all shapes are doing APIs, but very few have the awareness to make their API program public, and accessible to the general public. I think the&nbsp;<span>PSA Peugeot Citro&euml;n&rsquo;s APIs are a pretty interesting set of resources for making available to car owners, and worth talking about:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Telemetry</strong> - Request data from the car: average speed, location, instantaneous consumption, engine speed, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance Alerting -</strong> Request data from the various events or notifications that can be detected by the car: time before maintenance, fired alerts, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Correlation - </strong>These APIs lets your application evaluate your driving style with others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Making vehicle data, events and notifications makes sense to me when it comes to vehicles and APIs, and is something that seems like it should just be default&nbsp;mode for all automobile manufacturers. The correlation API seems in a different category, and elevated to more of an innovate class, beyond just the usual car activity. I'm not a huge car guy, but I know people who are, and being able to size up against the competition or a specific community, could become a little addictive.</p>
<p>I've added the&nbsp;PSA Peugeot Citro&euml;n&rsquo;s APIs to my monitoring of the space, and will keep an eye on what they are up to. I'm already following other user manufacturers&nbsp;like <a href="https://developer.ford.com/">Ford</a> and <a href="https://developer.gm.com/">GM</a> who have API efforts, as well as <a href="https://developer.hondasvl.com/">Japanese manufactuers like Honda</a>. I may have to stop, and take roll call in the world of automobiles and see who have official public API develop efforts, and put some pressure on those who do not have their program together yet (like they'll listen).</p>
<p>If you know of any auto related API efforts I do not already have in <a href="http://auto.stack.network/">my auto API stack</a>, please let me know--I depend on my readers to keep me tuned into which companies are the cool kids doing API.</p>

<p>A recent story&nbsp;from Gordon Wintrob (<a href="https://twitter.com/gwintrob">@gwintrob</a>) about how T<a href="https://getputpost.co/how-twilios-distributed-team-solves-developer-evangelism-c6bdb1a19212#.wmhz62h57">wilio's distributed team solves developer</a><a href="https://getputpost.co/how-twilios-distributed-team-solves-developer-evangelism-c6bdb1a19212#.wmhz62h57">evangelism</a>&nbsp;has given me a variety of seeds for stories on API Evangelist this week. I love that in 2016, even after an IPO, I am still writing positive things about Twilio and showcasing them as an example for other API providers to emulate.</p>
<p>Twilio just gets APIs, and they deeply understand how to effectively build a community of passionate developers, demonstrated by this statement from Gordon's story on developing credibility:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>How do you have technical credibility? You have to really be part of your programming community. Each of us is a member of our community, not marketing or trying to sell to it.</em></p>
<p>It sounds so simple. Yet is something so many companies struggle with. An API community is often seen as something external, and often times even the API is seen as something external, and this is where most API efforts fail. I know, you are saying that not all companies can be API-first, where the API is the core product focus like Twilio--it doesn't matter. Not being able to integrate with your developer community, is more about your company culture, than it is about APIs.</p>
<p>Another area my audience will critique me is around sales--you have to do sales to make money! Yes, and even Twilio has a sales team to come in at the right time. This is about building technical credibility with your developer community, by truly being part of it--if you are always trying to sell to them, there will always be an us and them vibe, and you will never truly be part of your own community.</p>
<p>As an API provider, I always recommend that you get out there and use other APIs, to experience the pain of being an API consumer. Using Twilio, and participating in the Twilio community should be the 101 edition of this. Where all API providers spend a couple of months using the Twilio API, and "actively" participating in their community before getting to work on their own API program.</p>

<p>I was working on a&nbsp;<a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">forkable definition of my API portal</a>&nbsp;and I wanted to evolve the icons that I usually use as part of my API storytelling. I primarily use the <a href="http://api.thenounproject.com/">Noun Project API</a>, to associate simple black and white icons which represent&nbsp;the stories I tell, companies I showcase, and topics I cover. One area I find the Noun Project deficient&nbsp;is when it comes to icons for specific technologies, so while working on my project I wanted to find a new source. I fired up the Googles and got to work.</p>
<p>I quickly came across <a href="http://devicon.fr/">Devicon,&nbsp;a set of icons representing programming languages</a>, designing &amp; development tools which you can use as a font or with&nbsp;SVG code. <a href="https://github.com/konpa/devicon">At the Github repo for the project</a>, it says they have&nbsp;78 icons with over 200 versions total. I used a set of the icons to d<a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/code/">isplay API SDKs on my API portal prototype</a>, allowing anyone who forks to turn on and off which programming languages they offer SDKs for.</p>
<p>Being pretty graphically challenged, as you can tell by my logo, I'm a big fan of projects like <a href="http://devicon.fr/">Devicon</a>--especially when they make it so simple, and so good looking, all at the same time. If you are needing icons for your API portal I recommend taking a look at what they are doing. They have images for all the technology that cool kids are using these days, and they seem open to crafting more if you find something missing.</p>

<p>People love to tell me how unreliable APIs are, while also echoing this sentiment across the tech blogosphere. I always find it challenging <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/05/reconciling-how-reliable-apis-are-while-also-embracing-tone-set-by-vc-investment/">to reconcile how the entrenreurs&nbsp;who spread these tales choose to put the blame on the technology</a>, and not the companies behind the technology, or more appropriately the investment behind the companies. APIs are just a reflection of what is going on already within a company, and are good, nor bad--they are just a tool that can be implemented well, or not so well.</p>
<p>I was taking some time this last week to work on my API monitoring system, which I call Laneworks. In addition to having my own API stack, <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">I depend on a variety of other APIs to operate my business</a>. As I was kicking the tires, poking around the code for some of my most valuable integrations I found myself thinking about the stability and reliability of APIs, and how stable some APIs have been for me.</p>
<p>Since 2011 I have stored ALL heavy objects (images, video, audio) used in my API monitoring and research on S3. I have NEVER had to update the code. Since 2012 I have used Pinboard as the core of my API curation system, aggregating links I favorited on Twitter, and added using my browser bookmarklet--again I have NEVER updated the code that drives this. Since 2013 all of my public websites run on Github using Github Pages, employing the Github API to publish blog posts, and all other content and data used in my research.</p>
<p>The Amazon S3, Pinboard, and Github APIs make my business work. Three suppliers who have been working without a problem for 5, 4, and 3 years. The only thing I have had to do is pay my bill, and keep my API keys rotated, and the reliable API vendors to the rest. Storing images, video, and audio, curated the news and other stories I share with you&nbsp;and publish the blog posts and web pages you use to browse my API research. So explain to me, why would you want to build a business on APIs, when they are so unreliable?</p>

<p>As the API Evangelist, I spend a lot of time thinking about evangelism (*your mind is&nbsp;blown*). <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/22/the-expanding-world-of-technology-evangelism/">TFrom what I'm seeing, the world of technology evangelism has been expanding</a>, where database, container, and other types of platforms are borrowing the approaches proven by API pioneers like Amazon and Twilio. As I'm doing work with Erik Wilde (@dret) around his <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">Webconcepts.info work</a>, and reading <a href="https://opcfoundation.org/about/what-is-opc/">an article about industrial automation standards</a>, I'm left thinking about how important evangelism is going to be for standards and specifications.</p>
<p>Standards are super important, so I have to be frank--the community tends to suck at evangelizing itself, in an accessible way that reflects the success established in the API world. I'm super thankful for folks like Erik Wilde, Mike Amundsen, and others who work tirelessly to evangelism API related web concepts, specifications, and standards. The importance of outreach and positive evangelism around standards reflect the reasons why I started API Evangelist--to make APIs more accessible to the masses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why I have to get behind folks like Erik who step up to help evangelize standards. I do not have the dedication required to tune into the W3C, IANA, ISO, and other standards bodies, and super thankful for those who do. So if I can help any of you standard obsessed folks hone your approach to storytelling, and evangelism let me know. I'd love to see standards evangelism become commonplace--making them more friendly, accessible, and known across the tech sector.</p>

<p>I have been slowly evolving the data core of each of my research projects from JSON to YAML. I'm still providing JSON, and even XML, Atom, CSV, and other machine-readable representations as part of my research, but the core of each project, which lives in the Jekyll _data folder are all YAML moving forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first started using YAML I didn't much care for it. When the OpenAPI Specification introduced the YAML version, in addition to the JSON version, I wasn't all that impressed. It felt like the early days of JSON back in 2008 when I was making the switch from primarily XML to a more JSON-friendly&nbsp;environment. It took me a while to like JSON&nbsp;because I really liked my XML--now it is taking me a while to like YAML&nbsp;because I really like my JSON.</p>
<p>I do not anticipate that JSON will go the same way that XML did for me. I think it will remain a dominant machine-readable format in what I do, but YAML is proving to have more value as the core of my work--especially when it is managed with Jekyll and Github. I am enjoying having been in the industry long enough to see these cycles, and be in a position where I can hopefully think more thoughtfully&nbsp;about each one as it occurs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/20/d3js-visualizations-using-yaml-and-jekyll/">D3.js Visualizations Using YAML and Jekyll</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">20 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://d3.js.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/bar-chart/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://d3.js.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/images/d3-js-bar-chart.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am increasingly using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> as part of my storytelling process. Since all my websites run using Jekyll, and published entirely using Github repositories wich are shared as Github Page sites, it makes sense to standardize how I publish my visualizations.</p>
<p>Jekyll provides a wealth of data management tools, including the ability to manage YAML dta stores in the _data folder. An approach I feel is not very well understand, and lacks real world examples regarding how to use when managing open data--I am looking to change that.</p>
<p>I like my data visualizations beautiful, dynamic, with the data right behind--making <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> the obvious choice. For this work, I took data intended for use as a bar and pie chart&nbsp;and published as YAML to this Github repositories _data folder. This approach to centrally storing machine-readable data, in the simple, more readable YAML format, makes the data behind visualizations much more accessible in my opinion.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/0ee5a0eff2de2038dc3b69b88f563097.js"></script>
<p>The problem with using D3.js visualization&nbsp;is that I need it in JSON format. Thankfully, using Jekyll and Liquid, I can easily establish dynamic versions of my data in JSON, XML, or any other format I need it in. I place these JSON pages in a separate folder I am just calling /data.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/148fd30889a79d324bd21e7c271cbb5b.js"></script>
<p>Now I have the JSON I need to power my D3.js visualizations. To share the actual visualization, I created separate editions for my bar and pie charts, and have the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for each chart, in its own file.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/27a4628dbb9c3f4392b2efb8d7500366.js"></script>
<p>There are two things being accomplished here. 1) I'm decoupling the data source in a way that makes it easier to swap in and out different D3.js visualizations, and 2) I'm centralizing the data management, making it easily managed by even a non-technical operator, who just needs to grasp how Jekyll and YAML works--which dramatically lowers the barriers to entry for managing the data needed for visualizations.</p>
<p>There is definitely a learning curve involved. Jekyll, Github Pages, and YAML take some time to absorb, but the reverse engineerability of this approach lends itself to reuse&nbsp;and reworking by any data curious person that isn't afraid of Github. I'm hoping to keep publishing any new D3.js visualization I create in this way, to provide small, forkable, data-driven visualizations that can be used as part of data storytelling efforts-<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/d3-js-using-yaml-jekyll">everything here is available as a public repo</a>.</p>
<p>As a 25-year data veteran, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2016/08/15/using-github-repos-and-jekyll-as-a-data-store/">I find myself very intrigued with the potential of Jekyll as a data management solution, something that when you combine with the social coding benefits of Github, and Github Pages, can unleash unlimited possibilities</a>. I'm going to keep working to define small, modular examples of how to do this, and publish as individual Github lessons for you to fork and learn from.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Sep 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-github.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am reworking the management layer for my APIs. For the last couple of years, I had aspirations of running my APIs with a retail layer generating revenue for API Evangelist--something which required a more comprehensive API management layer. In 2016, I'm not really interested in generating revenue from the APIs I operate, I'm just looking to put them to work in my own business, and if others want access I'm happy to open things up and broker some volume deals.</p>
<p>To accomplish this I really do not need heavy security or service composition for my APIs, I'm just needed to limit who has access so they aren't just 100% public, and identify those who are using, and how much they are actually consuming. To facilitate this I am just going to use Github as a trusted layer for authentication. Using an OAuth proxy, I'll let my own applications authenticate using their respective Github user, and identify themselves using a Github OAuth token when making calls to each API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each application I have operating on top of my APIs have its own Github account. Once they do the OAuth dance with my proxy, my system will then have a Github token identifying who they are. I won't need to validate the token is still good with each call, something I'll verify each hour or day, and cache locally to improve API performance. Anytime an unidentified token comes through, I'll just make a call to Github, and get the Github users associated, and check them against a trusted list of Github users who I have approved for accessing my APIs.</p>
<p>I'm not really interested in securing access to all the content, data, and algorithms I'm exposing using APIs. I'm only looking to identify which applications are putting them to work&nbsp;and evaluate their amount of usage each day and month. This way I can monitor my own API consumption, while still opening things up to partners or any other 3rd party developer that I trust--if they are using too much, I can drop them a message to have a conversation about next steps.</p>
<p>I'm still rolling out this system out, but it got me thinking about API access in general, and the possibilities that a trusted list of Github accounts could be used to expedite API registration, application setup, and the obtaining keys. Imagine if as a developer I could just ping any API, do an OAuth dance with my Github credentials, and get back my application id and secret keys for making API calls--all in a single flow. As an API provider I could just maintain a single trusted list of Github users, as well as consult other lists maintained by companies or individuals I trust, and reduce friction when onboarding, or automatically&nbsp;approve developers for higher levels of access and consumption.</p>

<p>APIs come in all different shapes and sizes. I focus on a specific type of APIs that leverage web technology for making data, content, and algorithms available over the Internet. While these APIs are available on the open Internet, who has the ability to discover, and put them to use will vary significantly. APIs have gained in popularity because of successful publicly available APIs like Twitter and Twilio, something that has contributed to these types of APIs being the dominant narrative of what APIs are.</p>
<p>A lack of awareness of what modern approaches to API management can do for securing web APIs as well as the dominance of this narrative that APIs need to be open like Twitter and Twilio tends to set the bar to unrealistic levels for API providers. Who has access to a web API is just one dimension of what APIs are, and sharing content, data, and algorithms securely via the web should be the focus. It's not whether&nbsp;or not we should do public or private APIs--it is about how you will be sharing your resources in a digital economy.</p>
<p>While I encourage ALL companies, institutions, and government agencies to be as transparent as they possibly can regarding the presence of their APIs, its documentation, and other resources--who actually&nbsp;can access them is entirely up to the discretion of each provider. You should treat ALL your APIs like they use public infrastructure (aka the web), secure them appropriately, and get to work making sure all your digital resources are accessible in this way, not being bogged down by useless legacy discussions.</p>
<p>Which is why I support putting the concept of the public API to rest as a dominant narrative around what is an API--you shouldn't hear me talking about public vs private anymore. If you do slap me.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Sep 2016</span>
        <p>The power of Jekyll on Github Pages as a data management solutions is not a very widely held concept. I'm always amazed at how technologists and programmers don't understand <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, let alone how it can be used as a data engine--maybe I can help a little by sharing my own usage. As I develop examples of this in action, I want to publish them as <a href="http://xml.son.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/">Github repositories that anyone can fork and reverse engineer to use in their own work</a>.</p>
<p>While it was not love at first sight for me, I'm increasingly becoming a fan of using YAML for storing and managing a significant portion of the data I use across my business. Part of the reasons I'm using YAML is its readability. The other reasons stem from the augmented benefits of using Jekyll and Github Pages to store and syndicate machine readable YAML for use across my storytelling--when you put YAML data into the _data folder for any Jekyll site, it opens up a new world of possibilities.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/325b2f3ca761b5deaf52666f78117b5d.js"></script>
<p>Any YAML data I put into the _data folder immediately become objects I can work with across any HTML page within a Jekyll site, <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">using Liquid</a>. Where this really starts to impact my world is when I started dynamically generating other formats of data stored as YAML.</p>
<p>First up is JSON. Here is the file I am using to generate a JSON representation of my central YAML file stored in _data folder.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/470db918abe87ac309c373c998e7a1c1.js"></script>
<p><a href="http://xml.son.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/data/products.json">Which when I view in my browser, via the Jekyll driven, Github Pages published website&nbsp;I get a separate JSON representation</a>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/01a280996ba007a6806852ae312ef26b.js"></script>
<p>Next up is XML. Here is the file I am using to generate a XML representation of my central YAML file stored in _data folder.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/37f5a98f29869dce1f243ea5a9a4ba7d.js"></script>
<p><a href="http://xml.son.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/data/products.xml">Which when I view in my browser, via the Jekyll driven, Github Pages published website&nbsp;I get a separate XML representation</a>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/4abec529e89e4b87a558a6e15986d8a3.js"></script>
<p>Next up is Atom. Maybe I may want a feed of the latest products added to the catalog, so here is the file I am using to generate an Atom XML representation of my central YAML file stored in _data folder.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/48fbdd576049d25257b2efafba7e0738.js"></script>
<p><a href="http://xml.son.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/data/atom.xml">Which when I view in my browser, via the Jekyll driven, Github Pages published website, I get a separate Atom XML representation</a>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/c4ecdeadf80622c2b54e040355745f2b.js"></script>
<p>From a single YAML file, I just generated a JSON, XML, and Atom representation of the same list of products. <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/xml-json-using-yaml-jekyll">It is all stored in a Github repository, and published as a Jekyll website hosted using Github Pages</a>. This particular Github repo is meant to just be a demonstration of what is possible using Jekyll, YAML, and Github Pages. I will use this work as a base in a variety of other projects, where I use these various formats to drive web and mobile applications, as well as visualizations and analytics used across my API storytelling.</p>
<p>There are a wealth of reasons why I conduct this type of work. First, it is work I will use in my own research and storytelling, which all operates using Github and Jekyll. Second, doing my work out in the open, using open source tools and definitions, published as Github repositories making my work forkable, and reusable by others. There is a learning curve involved with unpacking what is happening here, but I feel pretty strongly that these are reusable modules that anyone can put to use--not just developers.</p>
<p>I will publish other examples of this in action as I develop them. When I need the Liquid scripts to generate JSON, XML, or Atom feeds in any of my projects I will just visit this repo, and copy / paste. When I develop new ones I will generalize and publish here for everyone to use as well.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-portal.jpg" alt="" width="20%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">I am updating my minimum API portal definition</a>&nbsp;so I can apply to my own API infrastructure, and since I operate 100% on Github using Github Page and Jekyll, <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/portal-minimum">I have made it a forkable API portal definition that anyone can put to work as their own API developer portal</a>. This edition of my API portal definition uses Bootstrap for its UI, and Jekyll for the CMS, making it pretty extensible, and remixable once you fork it on Github.</p>
<p>My goal was to make a simple, forkable API portal, that could act as a checklist for API providers looking to quickly set up a presence for their API. I know many companies, institutions, and government agencies do not have the resources&nbsp;to host one, let alone the time to pay attention to all the details--that is my job! To help API providers out, I have included what I feel is a&nbsp;complete API portal in the&nbsp;_config.yml for the Jekyll site.</p>
<p>All you have to do is scroll down the API portal definition and comment out what you don't want, and fill in the areas you do, and the Jekyll site should do the rest. I've included the most common areas I like to see from all API providers in my definition.</p>

<p>This is just the first draft of my forkable API portal definition. I am going to apply to my Kin Lane, and API Evangelist API infrastructure, as well as a handful of independent APIs that I operate. Then I'm going to apply it to a couple of government APIs I want to simplify, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/08/defining-api-surface-area-by-converting-html-forms-to-open-api-specs/">like the USGS Water Services I am working o</a>n, to harden it a little bit. Sometimes all it takes is to better organize the information for an API, to help make it more accessible, and intuitive, reducing the friction when trying to get up and running.</p>
<p>I would wait a couple weeks to fork the API portal definition, until I stabilize it some more against theother APIs, unless you are feeling adventurous. If you aren't afraid of working with YAML, Jekyll, and Liquid driven HTML, the API portal is pretty fun to play with. If nothing else, <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/portal-minimum/blob/gh-pages/_config.yml">you can use the&nbsp;_config.yml as a checklist to think about as you review or craft your own API portal</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Sep 2016</span>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-sketchbook.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I have a vision of an API notebook in my head I desperately want to get out. First of all, I want to come up with another name for it, which is a journey that always starts with playing around with synonyms. Direct synonyms of notebook include a diary, journal, log, workbook, pad, and binder-yes, all of that is relevant to what I would like to see. After that, a few other words resonated, including album, collection, portfolio, and registry.</p>
<p>This isn't just a folder to put my API definitions. It will be the place where I go to find all <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">the definitions of 3rd party API which IÂ depend on</a>, as well as the APIs I'm designing, deploying, and operating as part of my own business. I want to be able to just record ideas, sketches, and thoughts I have as I'm thinking about APIs. I want to be able to annotate APIs that I find, and iterate, remix, and riff off of other API designers and architects work. Maybe an API sketchbook?</p>
<p>An artistic design book is just the beginning. I'd also like it to be my professional sketchbook,Â where my business partners and customers can discover the API I depend on, and share with the world. I want it to be a directory of APIs that are relevant to my business. My sketchbook is where I'm creative, but it is also where I get business done. Maybe acting as an API portfolio? I want it to be fun, but also accommodate my professional existence as well.Â </p>
<p>I just want a place where I can design and evolve the API definitions that impact my world. I want to be able to share them, as well as subscribe to other people's API designs. I want my designs versioned, and be able to play back their evolution, and see a timeline, and possibly the attributions of where I found my API inspiration, or leveraged an existing definition or specification. My API sketchbook / folio should evolve with me, and help me make sense of all the API definitions I use, discovery new ones, and always help me not reinvent the wheel.Â </p>
<p>Crafting my dream API sketchbook / portfolio is easier to write about than it will be to build. Doing it simply and beautifully will be hard. Doing it so it scales, and allows me to manage not just 10s or 100s of APIs, but work from thousands of APIs will be very difficult. I'm hoping it is something that I won't have to build on my own, and is an idea that many will contribute to, helping push forward the converstion around how we craft, store, organize, and collaborate around the APIs that are increasingly playing a central role in our business and personal world.</p>
