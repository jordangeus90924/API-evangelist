	<h3>The API Evangelist Blog</h3>
	<p>This blog is dedicated to understanding the world of APIs, exploring a wide range of topics from design to deprecation, and spanning the technology, business, and politics of APIs. <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-evangelist" target="_blank">All of this runs on Github, so if you see a mistake, you can either fix by submitting a pull request, or let us know by submitting a Github issue for the repository</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://launchany.github.io/mvd-template/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/launchany/minimum-viable-documentation-template+for-apis.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding:15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I am a big fan of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, the static content management system (CMS). <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist">All of API Evangelist runs as hundreds of little Jekyll driven Github repositories</a>, in a sort of microservices concert, allowing me to orchestrate my research, data, and the stories I tell across all of my projects. I recommend that API providers launch their API portals using Jekyll, whether you choose to run on Github, or anywhere else using the light-weight portable solution. I have <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">several Jekyll templates I use to to fork and turn into new API portals</a>, providing me with a robust toolbox for making APIs more usable.</p>

<p>My friend and collaborator James Higginbotham(<a href="https://twitter.com/launchany">@launchany</a>) has launched <a href="https://launchany.github.io/mvd-template/">a new minimum viable documentation (MVD) template for APIs</a>, providing API provides with everything they need out of the gate when it comes to a presence for their API. The MVD solution provides you with a place for your getting started, workflows, code samples, reference material, with OpenAPI as the heartbeat–providing you with everything you need when it comes to API documentation. <a href="https://github.com/launchany/mvd-template">It all is an open source package available on Github</a>, allowing any API provider to fork and quickly change the content and look and feel to match your needs. Which in my opinion, is the way ALL API documentation solutions should be. None of us should be re-inventing the wheel when it comes to our API portals, there are too many good examples out their to follow.</p>

<p>I know that Jekyll is intimidating for many folks. I’m currently dealing with this on several fronts, but trust me when I say that Jekyll will become one of the most important tools in your API toolbox. It takes a bit to learn the structure of Jekyll, and get over some of the quirks of learning to program using Liquid, but once you do, it will open up a whole new world for you. It is much more than just a static content management system (CMS). For me, it’s most significant strength has become as a data management system (DMS)??, with OpenAPI as the heart. I use Jekyll (and Github) for managing all my OpenAPI definitions, JSON and YAML files, and increasingly publishing my data sets in this way instead of relying on server-side technology. If you are looking for an new solution when it comes to your API portal, <a href="https://launchany.github.io/mvd-template/">I recommend taking a look at what James is up to</a>.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/09/05/api-evangelist-is-a-performance/">API Evangelist Is A Performance</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/t-shirts/KL_InApiWeTrust-1000.png" align="right" width="30%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I think I freaked a couple of folks out last week, so I wanted to take a moment and remind folks that API Evangelist is a performance. Sure, it is rooted in my personality, and I keep it as true to my view of the world of APIs as I can, but it is just a performance I do daily. When I sit down at the keyboard and research the world of APIs I am truly (mostly) interested in the technology, but when I craft the words you read here on the blog I am performing a dance that is meant to be interesting to the technology community in a way that draws them in, but then also gives them a swift kick in the pants when it comes to ethics of the technology, business, and politics of doing all of this.</p>

<p>Sure, my personality shines through all of this, and I’m being genuine when I talk about my own battles with mental illness, and other things, but please remember API Evangelist is a performance. It is a performance that is meant to counteract the regular stream of fake news that comes out of the Silicon Valley funded technology machine. <a href="http://contrafabulists.com/">API Evangelist is a Contrabulist production</a>, pushing back on the often exploitative nature of APIs. Not that APIs are exploitative, it is the people who are doing APIs are exploitative. Back in 2010, I saw that APIs were providing a peek behind the increasingly black box nature of web technology that was invading our lives through our mobile devices, and jumped at the opportunity to jam my foot in the door, even as the VC power brokers continue to look to look for ways to close this door.</p>

<p>In 2011, I found my voice as the API Evangelist explaining APIs to the normals, making these often abstract things more accessible. Along the way, I also developed the tone of this voice pushing back on the politics of doing APIs, calling out the illnesses I see in the space. These are the two areas I hear the most praise from my readers, something that has significantly shaped my performance over the last seven years. I have a pantheon of API characters in my head when I tell stories on API Evangelist, speaking to specific groups, while showcasing as many of the best practices from the space as I possibly can. I’m looking to shine a light on the good, first and foremost, but I’m also never going to shy away from showcasing the illnesses in the space as I have nothing to lose. I’m never looking to get VC funding, or do any technology startup, so throwing myself against the machine doesn’t ever worry me–I will keep doing it until I grow weary of this production.</p>

<p>I just wanted to take the time to help folks understand that all of this is a show. Sure, my rant last week was rooted in my own dark personal thoughts, but it was meant to be a reflection of the space (your darkness). I’m touched at the folks who reached out to me with concern, but I’m fine. If I am ranting on the Internet you can always be sure I’m fine. It is when I go silent for any sustained amount of time is when you should have concern. When I’m in my dark place I have NO interest in performing as API Evangelist, and increasingly I have little interest in Internet technology when I feel this way. If you are reading this, thank you for tuning into my little production. I enjoy doing it because it keeps me learning each day. It keeps me writing and telling stories each day. Hopefully along the way some of you also get some value from the stories I tell, whether their are positive, or a little dark like they were last week.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/09/05/acknowledging-the-good-in-the-api-space/">Acknowledging The Good In The API Space</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/kin-lane-api-evangelist-cartoon.png" align="right" width="25%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>With such a dark week of blog posts last week I wanted to make sure and start this week off with a brighter post, talking about the good I see in the API space. It can be easy to find than some of the darker things I talked about, but after seven years doing this I see enough good things going on in the API community, that I keep doing this performance I call API Evangelist. It can be easy to rant and rave about the bad, but I find it takes a lot of work to identify the good things going on in the cracks, as they rarely get the attention of the mainstream tech community propaganda engine.</p>

<p>First, there are some really smart folks who truly care about human beings and are dedicated to the world of APIs. I do not know of any other layer of technology that sustains a community of people that is not just about startups and mindless moving forward of technology in every industry. I can use all of my fingers counting the folks who truly care about doing APIs, and making a meaningful impact with them. I have had the pleasure of working with these folks, and brining many of them together as part of my APIStrat conference, and regularly enjoy learning from them, reading their stories, and engaging with them on a regular basis as part of this API journey.</p>

<p>Second, not all APIs are startup focused. I work with many API providers who are doing very interesting, non-startup, non-VC investment, and most importantly, non-exploitative API things. I regularly work with passionate folks doing APIs at all levels of government, making an impact on the environment, pushing for transparency in our legal system, helping provide human services, and truly making change in a meaningful way using web APIs. APIs are neither good, nor bad, or are they neutral, they are simply a reflection of their creators and operators. It keeps me going, to learn about the many ways in which APIs are being used for good, and moving beyond their startup origins, doing meaningful things that makes the lives of human beings better.</p>

<p>Third, APIs are just the next evolution of the web. All the bad things I talked about last week can just as easily be applied to the web. APIs do not have to be the next vendor solution, or something you have to buy. APIs are just about moving our bits and bytes around online, using low cost web technology. They often become the scapegoat for exploitation, unreliability, security, and privacy concerns, but as I said before they are just a reflection of their creator and operators. This is one of the main reasons I’m an evangelist for APIs, not because they are always a good idea, but because when they are done right, they can bring some important observability into some existing technological situations, helping us understand exactly what is going on behind the digital and algorithmic curtain.</p>

<p>It was a learning experience to spend a week ranting openly about the space last week. The way people responded, or didn’t response was very telling about the API community. It feels like something I will be doing regularly (maybe not at that scale), because I felt like it pushed back much of the illness in the space that can become very suffocating to an independent operator like me. The venture backed technology machine doesn’t always realize (or maybe it does) what an invasive and assaulting force it is. They think they are just asking for some free time, or for a guest post opportunity, and don’t often see how damaging they are, because everyone is doing it. I feel like I was able to carve out a defensive zone around what I do, even if it was just for a bit. Thanks again for all your support folks.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/restlet.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/kinlane.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px" /></p>
<p>I know many of you are thinking Kin Lane has lost his marbles (again). In reality, I lost them last week for a couple days because someone really pissed me off, then after a couple more folks pissing in my Cheerios, I checked out last week (this happens from time to time). This week I am actually feeling quite fine after moving to NYC from LA, but the posts for the last couple of days are from my notebook entries made while in a dark place last week. Normally, these posts would never see the light of day, but I’m feeling like they probably should this week. Its no secret, I’m fairly sure I’d be classified in the bi-polar realm (never been diagnosed), something I’ve thoroughly enjoyed since I was a teen, but for the last 20 years is something I’ve had 96% control of. I get angry, fly off the handle sometimes, and have bouts of depression, and life feels like a roller coaster, but for the most part I know the signals, know when to check out, and I am actually able leverage it to my favor–crafting the person that you all know as API Evangelist. It is the fuel for my research, and how I write these words.</p>

<p>Shocking? Run you off? Ok. I’ll accept that. I just wanted to show my readers the contrast between the night and the day, and showcase how hard I work to be really, really nice, and highlight the best of the API space on a daily regular basis. I’m hoping the honesty helps you see what is really going on, with the contrast showing you how much I work to sift through the world of APIs and find useful nuggets of information you might find valuable in your API journey. I really do enjoy what I do as the API Evangelist (most of the time), and I take pleasure in helping people understand the good and the bad of it, in as nice as possible way as I can. What grinds my gears is the folks who feel they need to jump on me, question my motivations, assume there is a hidden agenda, or just inflict their messed up version of the world on this magical world I’ve manage to carve out for myself (for all of us). I may seem pushy and intense this week, but I’m guessing y’all are in denial about how pushy and intense about the things you are passionate about in your world.</p>

<p>I also want to take a moment to highlight the mental illness that exists in the tech sector. It is everywhere if you know what to look for. How do you think I’m able to wrap my head around everything going on with APIs, and why I am an autodidact, and have an affinity for computers from an early age? Most of the white men programmers y’all are putting on a pedestal are mentally ill, they are either just really good at hiding it, or are so privileged that nobody has diagnosed or called them out for it. It is why they are so good at the computerz and Internetz. It is why many are taking pharmaceuticals and microdosing. Trust me, I’ve been there. Done that. Give them 10, 20 years, a divorce, more startup failures, and health problems, you’ll see more of them lose their shit. It is just a matter of time. The real danger there is that most of them don’t know they are ill, or are in denial. I got hints when I was 16, and saw the full spectrum from 20-25, then by the time my daughter was born at 28 I had already figured out most of the telltale signs I needed to keep myself grounded–most of the time. There are still exceptions, and moments when things sneak up on me.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/kin-lane-talks.jpg" align="right" width="25%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>As you read my posts this week, I’m sure you were like damn. WTF is going on? He’s paranoid, wacky, or unhinged. Read them all again, I’m only speaking truth. Is the racism and sexism that is ubiquitous in the tech industry any more crazy than me? Is the endless quest for money at all costs in the startup world any whackier than what I’ve written? Following every trend. Telling wild tales of what computer and technology is capable of. Worshipping the tech gods like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Marc Andressen, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and others any more sane that what I do as the API Evangelist? Is the exploitation of people’s privacy and security anymore more sane than what I’m putting forth about the API space? Is ignoring what advertising is doing to the web all about logical straightforward thinking? What makes tech CEOs, and entrepreneurs so much more valuable than teachers, nurses, and other folks? Y’all seem way crazier than I do. I’m sorry. It is just the crazy you know, and is being sensationalized–normalized.</p>

<p>I’m just living, doing what I love, studying the world of APIs, and trying to share my knowledge through my writing. I’m not exploiting and taking advantage of you to get rich. I’m just trying to make a living, and make sense of this Internet age we find ourselves in. Which I have to say that your crazy, seems to making the world a pretty crazy place lately, with Trump and all. Just saying. Anyways, I’m going to take things back down a notch. I’m going to stay off the phone with some of you crazy folks, and stay out of your chaotic companies and organization, and settle back in with my nice NPR like API Evangelist tone. So please don’t come pissing me off again, make sure and pay your invoices, and don’t pick fights with me, and hopefully we won’t have to go here again. I’ll keep things way more sane, less rantier, with just the occasional amping up of things to make some points get across properly along the way.</p>

<p>I also want to thank all of you who reached out privately to make sure I was ok. This means the world to me. You guys are my heroes, and I encourage more of you to do this with other folks in the space. Together, maybe we can all take the crazy down a notch or two and begin to get things back to normal. I have a pretty good handle on my crazy, but I know there are many other folks out there that need your help right now. We need more discussion, education, and support when it comes to mental illness in the space. I personally have talked two people down off the ledge privately in my time as the API Evangelist, and I’m sure there are plenty of others I haven’t have the chance to help. So please talk to each other, and be understanding. You never know when someone might be slipping into the dark.</p>

<p>As I told Tony Tam (my hero) earlier this week–thanks for putting up with me, I really appreciate it.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Sep 2017</span>

<p>Don’t who know who I am? I am the API Evangelist. Ok, I know this post is dripping with ego. However, it is the last post in my week of API rants, and I’m just pumped from writing all of these. These types of posts are so easy to write because I don’t have to do any research, and real work, I just write, putting my mad skills at whitesplaining and mansplaining to work–tapping into my privilege. So I’m going to end the week with a bang, and fully channel the ego that has developed along with the persona that is API Evangelist.</p>

<p>However, there is a touch of truth to this. If you are operating an API today, and you do not know who I am, I’m just going to put it out there–you live in a silo. I have published around 3,000 blog posts since 2010 on APIs. I’m publishing 3-5 posts a day, and have consistently done so for seven years. There are definitely some major gaps in that, but my SEO placement is pretty damn good. You type API or APIs, and I’m in the top 30 usually, with the occasional popping up on home page. The number thing I get from folks who message me is that they can’t search for anything API without coming across one of my posts, so they want to talk to me. So why is it that you do not know who I am? I have some ideas on that.</p>

<p>It is because you do not read much outside your silo. When you do, you don’t give any credit to authorship. So when you have read any of my posts you didn’t associate them with a person named Kin Lane. You operate within your silo 98% of the time, and the 2% you get out, you really don’t read much, or learn from others. I on the other hand spend 98% of my time studying what others are doing, and 2% hiding away. My goal is to share this with you. I’d say 75% of my work is just referencing and building on the work of others, only 25% is of my own creation. I’m putting all of this out there for you, and you don’t even know it exists. What does that tell you about your information diet? It tells me that you probably aren’t getting enough exercise and nutrients as part of your regular daily intake, that will make your API operations be less healthy and strong–reading is good for healthy bones girls and boys!</p>

<p>Kin Lane doesn’t have this much ego, but API Evangelist does. The fact that you don’t know who I am shows you aren’t spending enough time studying the API space before launching an API. I’m hoping that you in your API journey you learn more about the importance of coming out of your bubble, and learning from your community, and the wider API community. It is why we do APIs, and why APIs work (when they do). I wrote this title to be provocative and part of my week of rants, but honestly it is true. If you haven’t come across one of my API posts, and stumbled on my blog at some point you should probably think about why this is. The most successful API providers and evangelists I know are tuned into their communities, industries, and wider API space, and are familiar with my work–even if they don’t all like me. ;-)</p>

<p>You know your API stuff. You know it so well, you don’t even need to look at other APIs. There is no reason to Google and look for other APIs because your stuff is that good. Your idea came to you in a flash, and you worked for an entire weekend to bring to life. Your a genius. Everyone has told you so. This stuff just comes to you, and as long as you are left alone, the magic just happens. If people just stay out of your way, do not burden you with outside influences, and unnecessary concerns, you will keep rolling out amazing APIs that everyone will love and need.</p>

<p>You consume books, and digest endless blog posts and white papers recommended by your trusted network of friends. You don’t ever notice authorship. They don’t matter. It is all about feeding your mind, and you will decide whether it is worthy or not. You don’t save bookmarks for citations or attributions, once inside your brain ALL ideas becomes yours. If someone’s idea is dumb, you make sure an let them know, making sure they are aware of how they are substandard and beneath you. If your friends let you know your ideas are amazing, you let them know they are great too, and will be rewarded by being in your presence, and part of your team.</p>

<p>That one chick that was hired last year made the mistake of blurting out in a meeting, “isn’t that the same thing as that startup that launched last month?”. She isn’t on the core team anymore. You did look at what she was talking about, and their API design is inferior, and the look of their site just turned you off–no need to continue. This is why you don’t conduct due diligence for your API projects. Why spend time looking at so many bad ideas? It takes away from your time to make the magic happen. Why do people keep wasting your time with this stuff? It is clear your ideas are superior, just look at your numbers. Clearly your APIs are well received, and all the feedback from partners have been great. I mean 60% of top startups in the sector are using your service, who cares what else is out there.</p>

<p>All of this is true in your bubble, but it won’t always pencil out outside. What you do not know or see will always eventually begin to diminish your work. The aspects of the markets you don’t see will never see the value of your work. You will never truly grow and evolve if you do not acknowledge the ideas that have influenced you. You weren’t born with all this knowledge, you are learning, borrowing, stealing, and building on the ideas of others. You should always learn from what is already out there, even if it is the worst of the worst. Through studying your competition your ideas will become hardened and truly competitive, and they will have strength when operating outside your bubble, beyond your control. You never know, you might actually come across a gem in the pile of bad ideas, something or someone you never imagined. Something that might shift the paradigm for you.</p>

<p>In your youth, this type of isolation, and bubble creation might work, but eventually you will miss certain signals and trends. There will be market forces that you and your network will miss, and once you begin to fall behind, it will be difficult to catch up. You will be building genius APIs that nobody wants or understands because your work as lost its relevance and context. You may have your finger on the pulse now, but you are not being honest with yourself about how you found that pulse, and are too confident that you will always have it. A significant part of your success has been your privilege, and that you are playing in this game while things are still new. With each wave of growth, and entry of new players, you will become irrelevant, and eventually old and in the way. The new geniuses will make the same mistakes you did, and shut you out, just like you have done to so many. It is how all of this works as time moves on.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algorotoscope/cyber-api-description-wars/mosaic-face_internet_numbers.jpg" align="right" width="35%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I know you are used to people telling you that you are creative, and your ideas are great, but I’m here to tell you they aren’t. You lack any imagination, creativity, or sensibility when it comes to your APIs. Some of it is because you are personally lacking in these areas, part of it is because you have no diversity on your team, but it is mostly because you all are just doing this to make money. As creative as you think doing a startups is, they are really just about making money for your bosses, and investors–not a lot of imagination, creativity, or sensibility is required.</p>

<p>You could invest the time to come up with good ideas for applications and stories on your blog, but you really don’t want to do the work, or even stand out in the group. It is much easier to just phone it in, follow the group, and let your bosses and the existing industry trends dictate what you do each day. If the business sector you operate within is doing it, you are doing it. If you see something funny online or at a conference you will do it. You have a handful of blogs you read each weekend, that you will rewrite the best posts from and publish on your own blog. Your Twitter account is just retweeting what you find, and you don’t even push out your own stories, because you have already tweeted out the story you copied in the first place.</p>

<p>Don’t beat yourself up about this, you come by it honestly. Your privilege affords you never really getting out of your comfort zone, and the people around you make you feel good enough. Everyone on  your team is the same, and your bosses really don’t care, as long as you are just creating content, and sending out all the required signals. Just make it look like you are always busy, and keep all the channels active. You don’t actually have to support your API consumers, just make sure you are having conversations with them on forums, and the channels your boss can keep an eye on. Doing too much will make you a target. Keep an eye on your coworkers and never do anymore than they are, establishing a kind of solidarity of mediocrity. This isn’t rocket surgery, its API theater.</p>

<p>You know deep down that you have some creativity in there, but it is something that has never been encouraged. This is the damaging effects of your privileged world. Your parents, teachers, bosses, and friends never push you, and neither do you. You don’t have to. If this story pisses you off, you really have nobody to blame. You’ve never had to work hard. You have never pushed yourself to do any of the hard work required to fail, on the path to becoming creative, developing your sensibility, and honing your imagination. How are you ever going to know what you are capable of if you do not put yourself out there. Creativity isn’t created in a silo. People aren’t just born with sensibility. And API aren’t lacking in imagination by default. There are many APIs operating out there that possess all these characteristics, and are leading the conversation–why aren’t you one of them?</p>

<p>Your API service is the next big thing. It is something that every API provider will be needing, and you are confident it will be something that makes the API management space look like a momentary trend. You have a SaaS, as well as an open source edition, and have invested thousands of hours into your website, documentation, and you even have an API. Everything is CI/CD ready, and you speak fluent OpenAPI. You have all the bases covered, and adoption with the first wave of users has been great, and the sales numbers are meeting all the project. There is just one thing, you haven’t invested anything into the educational resources for your customers, and the companies they work for.</p>

<p>After a year of operation you are so confident in your team, and the services and tools you have, you feel like this is a sure thing. You’ve sold to all your startup friends, and have trended well on Product Hunt and Hacker News, and you see organic discussions about how your services are essential. Your API service provider startup is now ready for primetime, you are expand beyond the west coast, and begin targeting a handful of verticals in a couple of the biggest markets. Your research tells you that these industries are struggling with their APIs, and what you have is the solution to their pain–this is gonna be easy!</p>

<p>Six months later, your new user numbers are still growing, but active users have declined. Nobody is using your tool after the free trial period. You’ve hired armies of sales guys to go out and push, and come back with more information about what is happening. The number one thing you hear is that people just don’t get it. Not only do they not understand why your tools and services are valuable, they really don’t speak the same language when it comes to the API providers you are used to selling to. The groups you have worked with so far just get it, and they see the value to their mature API operations. The new businesses you’ve been targeting barely know what an HTTP status code is, and just aren’t that interested in CI/CD, microservices, GraphQL, or any of the other buzzwords you are used to pushing.</p>

<p>The companies you have in the funnel right now all have API programs, but they just aren’t that API literate and aware. They are just getting by, doing a mix of web services and web APIs, with traditional database connections, FTP dumps, and whatever else it takes to get thing done. They don’t understand the web, anything API, are lucky if they can go a week without sever outage or hiccup, let alone continuously integrate or deploy anything. You didn’t budget for this. Hell, you didn’t budget for educating users about anything, let alone playing catch up at this scale. These developers don’t get API at all, and without a base level of awareness, they can’t see where your tools and services fit into the big picture.</p>

<p>You’ve taken this intel back to your boss, but he doesn’t care. You obviously aren’t selling hard enough. Push harder to get them to sign a contract. Tell them whatever they want to hear to get them signed on. There is no budget for playing schoolteacher. This isn’t grade school. It isn’t your problem that they are so API illiterate. After another six months of this it is clear you are about to replaced with someone who will get the job done. Your lack of planning and investment in the area of education regarding not just your product, but also how a modern application and API lifecycle works will be the end of at least your job. Don’t worry though, in another 12 months it will be the end of the API service provider startup you work for as well. The world just wasn’t ready for your amazing API tools and services.</p>

<p>Just admit it, you could care less about your API consumers. You are just playing this whole API game because you read somewhere that this is what everyone should be doing now. You figured you can get some good press out of doing an API, get some free work from developers, and look like you are one of the cool kids for a while. You do the song and dance well, you have developed and deployed an API. It will look like the other APIs out there, but when it comes to supporting developers, or actually investing in the community, you really aren’t that interested in rolling up your sleeves and making a difference. You just don’t really care that much, as long as it looks like you are playing the API game.</p>

<p>Honestly, you’d do any trend that comes along, but this one has so many perks you couldn’t ignore it. Not only do you get to be API cool, you did all the right things, launched on Product Hunt, and you have a presence at all the right tech events. Developers are lining up to build applications, and are willing to work for free. Most of the apps that get built are worthless, but the SDKs you provide act as a vacuum for data. You’ve managed to double your budget by selling the data you acquire to your partners, and other data brokers. You could give away your API for free, and still make a killing, but hell, you have to keep charging just so you look legit, and don’t raise any alarm bells.</p>

<p>It is hard to respect developers who line up and work for free like this. And the users, they are so damn clueless regarding what is going on, they’ll hand over their address book and location in real-time without ever thinking twice. This is just to easy. APIs are such a great racket. You really don’t have to do anything but blog everyone once in a while, show up at events and drink beer, and make sure the API doesn’t break. What a sweet gig huh? No, not really, you are just a pretty sad excuse of a person, and it will catch up with you somewhere. You really represent everything wrong with technology right now, and are contributing to the world being a worse place than it already is–nice job!</p>

<p>A growing number of SMBs, SMEs, and other institutions, organizations, and government agencies are launching APIs, but the age APIs as the core product will thin, and those that do emerge and operate independently will be increasingly absorbed into the cloud platforms they operate on. The tractor beam of AWS, Google, and Azure are becoming to strong for us API providers to resit. We use their platforms to deploy and manage our APIs, we’ve ceded control over our operations to their clouds, it is just a matter of time before each of the APIs we depend on are assimilated into the cloud machine.</p>

<p>Sure, we’ll still get access to valuable resources that we couldn’t launch ourselves, things like Google Maps, and resources at scale like Amazon EC2. But our platforms will be closely watching our trajectories and they will make the calculating decision whether what we are doing is valuable enough to acquire, or just suffocate by launching a competitive service. Whoops, sorry! What you are doing is a great idea, but you will have three choices, don’t do it, sell to us, or we’ll drive you out of business. The open landscape of APIs will become thousands of cloud APIs that feel like we have an unlimited amount of resources, but in reality it will just limit and control available resources, allowing the cloud bigcos to steer the space wherever they want to–controlling the creation and distribution of ideas.</p>

<p>It was fun while it lasted. We were able to work on our own farms for a while, and use each others free range organic API resources, but pretty soon it will just be the factory model of API consumption. Sure, prices will be low when the cloud giants are doing battle, but when they aren’t we’ll be paying a premium for simple resources. When any newcomer emerges looking to disrupt any area of the API space they’ll be quickly consumed, suffocated, and silenced, removing any threat. Think of the broadband access in the United States currently, that is what API consumption will look like in 20 years. There will be no options, no diversity, and we’ll be slaves to the bigcos. We will look back at the cloud period of APIs and regret that we ever gave them so much power.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/36349148770_1a9d2692b2_z.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>People love to point out that APIs are unreliable. You can’t depend on them. They go away at any point, and they just aren’t something you want to be building your business on top of. When in reality APIs aren’t reliable it is the business, people, and investment behind them. The reality of the startup game is that us API consumers aren’t actually the customer, we are just numbers in a larger game where startup founders and their investors are looking for enterprise customers to purchase their startup getting the desired exit. The API is just about attracting consumers, who will do the legwork to bring in users, adding to the value of a company.</p>

<p>As the startup funding landscape continues to dry up, shift, and evolve towards <a href="https://www.icoalert.com/">more riskier and volatile versions of investment like ICO</a>s, things are only going to get worse. Of course, few conversation will place the blame on the people and companies behind, but APIs will continue to be the scapegoat for the instability. It works just like the robots coming for your jobs. You never hear that rich people who own companies, that are making decisions to replace workers with robots are coming for your jobs. Its the robots. Technology in many forms makes for a great blame shield, absorbing the responsibility for the volatility, instability, and scams that are going on across the landscape.</p>

<p>In reality, nothing much changes for us API consumers. You need to get to know your API providers, well as the company and people behind them. Study their approach to operating their API. Do they communicate? Do they have proper support? Do they communicate their uptime status? What type of funding is propping them up, and the shape of their business model use. Make sure you always have a plan B if you can, and do not trust that ANY API will be around forever. If possible, come up with failover plans, and run drills with your team regarding what will happen when APIs fail, become unreliable, or go away entirely. Ultimately it is up to you to determine the impact unreliable APIs will have on your APIs. We can blame API providers, startups, and VCs as much as we want, but it is entirely up to us to help stabilize the API space for our users.</p>

<p>Investment, fundraising, and chasing exits will be the #1 area of instability for the API space. After that it will be the network, ranging from network neutrality going away to lack of investment in capacity and security. While the growth in the number of companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies doing APIs will keep things on forward trajectory, the reputation of APIs will continue to take a hit when it comes to the stories people tell about who is to blame. APIs are the frontline for almost everything occurring online these days, and this will make it the first place everyone will be pointing the finger. It is up to us in the API community to keep telling stories putting the blame where it is deserved. If we are not telling stories, the other side will, and they’ll be firing up the pundits, continuing to let irresponsible API startups get away with their bullshit games.</p>

<p>We tend to look at APIs as something we opt into. As an API consumer we choose to integrate with these external APIs. We made a conscious decision to put an API to work. We navigate our way to their API portals, learn about an API from its documentation, and take back what we know along with a handful of URIs, and bake the APIs into our internal systems and applications. When in reality we are just worker bees sent to find pollen, and bring the pollen back to the hive, unaware that the pollen contains an invasive species, and rarely do we ever think too deeply about why we are doing all of this–just following orders.</p>

<p>We are told by our coworkers, the tech blogosphere, and by API providers that we need these things. Often times we are enticed with dreams of striking it rich, and that we are mining a platform for its riches, but really we are being mined by the platform, making it richer. Facebook, Twitter, Uber, Google, and other platforms want us to think APIs are democratizing, and that we are being empowered. There is always light at the end of the tunnel for the free labor we do as API consumers, and application developers. Along this journey, rarely do we realize the data we giving away, the free labor we’ve offered up without ever being asked, and how we’ve done the heavy lifting for this invasive, disruptive species we’ve invited into our lives. Once embedded, this species is surveilling, extracting, and taking what it needs, only giving back what it needs to keep its host alive.</p>

<p>We’ve been tricked by the API mirror. We look at it and see ourselves, and listen to the stories and myths that we tell ourselves, as we read they hype in the tech blogosphere, and on the Redditz and Githubz. We seek out the machine, do the work to integrate it into our lives, then we evangelize it’s spread to our friends, neighbors, and clients. It doesn’t matter how the host machine morphs, changes, acquires, evolves, and deprecates. We keep doing the work. We keep inviting more of the  invasive species into our homes. As we convince our application users to invite the invasive species into their lives, at first it was just one, now it’s hundreds, and next year it will be thousands of them, infecting every corner of our personal and professional existence. When will we stop and ask ourselves if this is worth it? When will we stop doing the work for them, and realize where this is all leading? The invasive species are only growing stronger, and consolidating, eventually we won’t be able to say no, we will be forced to do their bidding, and let them have their way in our homes, businesses, and public space.</p>

I’m totally happy for folks to inform me about their company, products, case studies, and other API goings on with their company. This is the bread and butter for my storytelling on API Evangelist–please keep it coming. However, the folks who ask me to work for free, what are you thinking? Where does this ethic come from in the tech sector, where folks expect you to work for their startup for free? It is something that has  really gotten to ridiculous levels.</p>

<p>Join our webinar. Write a story for our blog. Contribute to a white paper. Join our podcast. Speak at our event. Teach a workshop. Come visit our company. Talk about our products and services. Help us craft our strategy. Do some research on this subject so we can use it. Tell us what we are doing wrong. Download, install, and play with our tool, and provide us with feedback. Take this 148 question survey that will only take you 45 minutes. Jump on the phone with us so we can pick your brain. Post our infographic to your site. Share this out via your Twitter account. Vote us up on Hacker News. Commit to our open source project. Help us create an API definition. Can you review this project specification. On, and on, and on. Oh, and hey I just wanted to email you again, because you didn’t respond to the last two emails!</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. If you know me, and we have history, feel free to ask me for favors, but remember, I do not have a job. I’m happy to help my friends, and love participating in podcasts with smart people, and reviewing my friends writing, because they scratch my back. They throw me bones, and have a history of given me exposure, and paying me for actual work. However, if we do not know each other, and have never talked, why on earth would you be asking me to work for free? Why would I want to take my brand that I’ve invested in building for seven years, and transfer that value to you for nothing? I don’t know you, your company, or anything about the value you deliver. I have to make a living just like you, and I can’t be working for free, or there would be nothing of value for both of us.</p>

<p>I know many of you are excited by the seemingly constant forward motion of the tech space, and that you might not realize that you are being rude. You may not be able to see it because you are in the middle of it, but much of startup culture is built on exploitation of others, and just because you are willing to be exploited by your investors, and those around you doesn’t mean you should expect others to fall in line. I’m a professional, and I’m happy to share my knowledge of the space, but it means you need to meet me halfway, and strike a business deal with me. This means emailing, DM’ing, and contacting me in a way that sets that table, not just expecting I will work for free. I appreciate your excitement, but please respect my time, and all the work I’ve put into my business, and I’ll do the same for you.</p>

<p>I’m really honored that some of my partners are kind enough to offer me a piece of the action in their companies, in exchange for what I do. I really am. However, going forward I’m going to have to decline any stock options in exchange for work, or advising, because it really doesn’t pencil out for me. I know it is the currency you are working with, getting investment in exchange for options, and trying to get knowledge, talent, and other forms of investment in exchange as well. I trust it will work out in your favor, but from my vantage point, there really is no upside in the game.</p>

<p>I regularly receive accusations of having and agenda because of real or perceived interest in companies, so with this hit on my brand, and the lack of return from the historic stock options I’ve had historically, it just doesn’t work out. My last advisor options netted me $319, for about 60 hours of work on, and travel costs out of my own pocket. I’m sure if I had more capital investment, and a bigger piece of the action, I’d fare better, but for the stake I get thrown–it just doesn’t do it for me. Plus, I have a manila folder in the filing cabinet of more significant shares that aren’t worth the paper they are printed on, so stock options really doesn’t float my boat in the first place.</p>

<p>Please don’t let this hurt your feelings. I know you are heavily invested in the value of your options, but I’m just not there. I’m happy to find other arrangements to make things happen, but with the way that stock options get wielded against me, and used to potentially discredit what I’m doing, it just isn’t worth anymore. As it stands today I only have stake in a single company–<a href="https://skylight.digital/">Skylight Digital</a> (5%). I have NO stake in any API related company, and I am going to keep it that way. I’m not 100% against an equity stake, but the risk of low stake investments, and the high risk of damage to my brand leaves me extremely critical about any conversation in this area.</p>

<p>It is another fascinating area of the startup game in my view, where people like punching down, instead of up when it comes to questioning the ethics and credibility folks in the API space. People be all questioning my ethics, but afraid to ever go after startups, or investors, because it might hurt their chances to be invited into the club some day! It’s a crazy financing reality in the API space, where up is down, and down is up, and I’m just beating that API Evangelist drum. #onward</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/photos/36609070321_c7122be05f_z.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I am the first to admit that I suck at the money game. I just don’t care. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve made a significant amount of money in my career, and command a phat six figure salary when I’ve done the job thingy, and I don’t have a problem asking for a decent rate when I’m consulting. It is just that I don’t care about climbing the money ladder, because I realized in my early 20s that it was never enough. I’ve had business partners run off with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, screw me out of the equity in multiple companies, and I’ve experienced what people will do to get at that next rung of the ladder. I quickly saw that you are never happier with each rung you climb, and often times you end up much unhappier the higher up you go–which is why I stay where I am at.</p>

<p>If you have been one of my partners you know I suck at invoicing regularly. Honestly, I don’t think about it until I have to. Which regularly I forget an entire month. Unless I’m looking looking at eviction, or have something I need to purchase, I’m more obsessed with working. I love what I do (mostly), and if someone would just drop money in my account each month, I just keep beating the API Evangelist drum, and never look to make beyond what it takes to keep me going each month. Being independent is a hustle, and it takes the support of my partners (thanks 3Scale, Runscope, Restlet, and Tyk) to make this work, along with some side consulting hustle to fill in the gaps. I mostly prefer the low monthly sponsorship money because the consulting hustle is a chore, and chasing down the money can be a full time job. I’d say 1/3 of the time its about getting plugged into corporate system(s), 1/3 of the time smooth sailing, and 1/3 of the time I’m getting screwed.</p>

<p>Honestly, the companies who want an NDA, contract, and all the trimmings are the ones I’ll usually walk away from. When I have a contract, I almost always get screwed over. I have more unpaid contracts from more well known corporations and startups than I can shake a stick at. I’m amazed at the folks who talk me up, tell me how much they love what I do, and want my services…then get what they need, don’t pay their invoice, and go radio silent. I also get many folks who tell me how their API budget wasn’t as big as they had hoped this quarter, and my fees would be such a big hit. Another I hear regularly is startups waiting for their investment, and at some point they’ll kick me down when they get theirs. The space is full of excuses regarding how hard-done-by everyone is with their operating budgets, runway, and what not. Yeah, I know what you mean–your hard times means I won’t make rent this month. I get it. I do.</p>

<p>This is all a game. The only difference is I’m admitting it, and you aren’t. I feel like we are all in this together, trying to build community, and you are secretively in it for yourself, and working it from every angle. Don’t worry, I know not all of you are like this, and when I’m done with API rant week, I’ll showcase some of the heroes in my world (you know who you are). I just wanted to take the time to shame some of you for the greedy, inconsiderate individuals you are, playing a nice game on the front, but making sure you always get yours. The differences is that you’ll have a rough time in the next meeting, and I’ll be out of my apartment, unable to make it to my next consulting gig, or just unable to meet my wider personal and professional obligations. But it’s cool, I’m sure you got this all figured out, and you will sleep well at night. It’s just business.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time defending my space as the API Evangelist. I’ve had lengthy battles with folks in the comments of my blog for defending women, charging for my services, being pay for play, having secret agendas, and much more. I’ve had my site taken down a handful of times (before I made static on Github Pages), because I stood up for my girlfriend, or just joined in on the wrong (right) cause. When you have been doing this as long as you have, you see the size of the armies of tech bros that are out there, waiting to pounce. It is why I don’t share links to Reddit or Hacker News anymore. I stopped sharing to DZone for same reason, but they’ve since cleaned up their community, brought in some great talent (including women), and I’ve started syndicating there again.</p>

<p>Most recently I had someone accuse me of pay for play, even though there was no disclosure statement present, and I have had two other folks accuse me of having an agenda set forth by my partners. If you know me, you understand how ridiculous this is, but this never stops the waves of young men finding their way to my site, and pointing the finger. What I find fascinating about this is these men never point the finger at Techcrunch, or call out API startups (and bigcos) for colluding, sponsoring, pay for play, and the other bullshittery that goes on. They go after folks who are outspoken against the machine, and never after the machine itself. If people don’t like something I said, or what someone I’m writing about is up to, they tend to go after me, without spending any time getting to know me, looking at my background, or looking at the seven years of storytelling on my site–<a href="http://apievangelist.com/archive/">there is a single page to do it</a>!</p>

<p>The majority of these folks rarely ever have their own blog, name and pictures on their Twitter or Github accounts, and have a minimum digital footprint. They don’t understand what it is like to be out in the public sphere sharing their ideas on a daily basis, and prefer hiding behind anonymity while they go after the little guy. Again, rarely do you see them going after the Silicon Valley, or larger corporate machine–too big of target. I have special Twitter lists I add these folks too, and usually when one of them pisses in my Cheerios I’ll spend some time seeing what the others are up to, and most times it is more of the same. Trolls. It is easy to dismiss these folks as part of the wider illness we see infecting the Internet, but much like sexism and racism, the real damage is done by the waves of complicit individuals and platforms who support them, chime in, pile on, and maintain an environment where this type of behavior is normalized.</p>

<p>For the most part I’m a diplomat. I tend to perform API Evangelist in a supportive, friendly tone. I started API Evangelist on this tone with intent. I saw the meanness in the space, fully grasped my assholeness as a VP of technology within an enterprise group, and wanted to do something different, and help people feel like APIs were approachable and friendly. I still support this tone, but this week, I’m performing a more offensive version of API Evangelist. One that is calling y’all out for the bullshit that you do each day online in this business, or condone and support daily in your complacency. I’m not really as unhinged as these posts make me out to be (close), I’m just exploring the illness that is rampant in the space, and pushing back a little. There is a significant amount of cover afforded to VCs, bigcos, and the startups who support their message, and for the handful of us out in the open, we often become a much easier target, when in reality there should be much more accountability for those that are responsible for the illnesses in the tech sector, ad are often out of site, but actually have their hands on the puppet strings that make things go around.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2017</span>

<p>You are full steam ahead with your microservices campaign. You’ve read <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">Martin Fowlers blog post</a>, and talked about the topic with your team for the last six months. After a couple pilot projects, you are diving in, and have started decoupling the monolith of systems that you depend on to operate your business each day. You have mapped out all the technical details of all code, and backend systems in play, and have targeted about 30% of existing systems for reworking using a microservices strategy. Yet, despite all your planning, your microservices effort will still fail just like your API efforts, and its predecessor the SOA initiative did.</p>

<p>Despite all your research, planning, and eye for the technical detail in about 7 months everything will begin to slow, and by month 10 you will begin to get very, very frustrated. You see, you haven’t included any of the human element in your planning. You have thought about the business, cultural, legal, financial, and other non-technical aspects of operating your systems. You’ve done a fine job of developing a strategy for decoupling your monolith database, but you haven’t invested any time in what it will take to educate and bring up to speed all the business users, support, QA, and other folks you will need to have up to speed to actually make all this work. You are so blinded by technological trends, you forget to spend time talking to the people.</p>

<p>You are feeling good right now because you have surrounded yourself with yes men. People who are in perfect alignment with what you are doing. They think like you, and have drank the same kool-aid. However, once you start implementing your grand strategy to make every smaller, more micro, you will begin to see friction. Sales folks will begin to see you as a threat as you fragment their landscape, and be seen as taking a piece of their action. Business users will begin to freak out, because while they had to battle with IT before to get access to resources, now they have deal with man many smaller teams, with even more unfriendly people to talk with–you just increased the scope of what they need to know. Many will see your work as just increasing complexity, and expanding the landscape of their work, in an already hectic world. As this perception increases they will find ways to throw a monkey wrench into your finely tuned plan.</p>

<p>Your SOA rollout failed because it was to heavy handed, dictated everything, giving vendors too strong of a voice, while also strengthening IT too much in the eyes of business groups. Your API efforts underestimated the fatigue management and businesses users experience from SOA, and your team never really believed in API anyways–they just thought it was a fad, trend, and pipe dream. Now your team is sold on it being all about offering up smaller services, and you are paying lip service to fact that “service” should be including more than just the technical, but you actually haven’t done the heavy lifting. You don’t have your training, support, documentation, QA, testing, discovery, terms of service, security and other critical aspects of each service in place, let alone the comprehensive view of how this works across the thousands of microservices you are planning. Let’s get real, your microservices plan will fail just like API, and SOA. You are just too in love with the technical, and willfully blind to the human side of all of this to ever make it work.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algorotoscope/stories/36575484422_087495fca9_z.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>You just got three separate calls, and countless emails alerting to the fact that you just had a major security breach. You don’t know the extent of the damage yet, but it looks like they got into your primary customer database via the APIs you depend on for all your mobile applications. You are sitting in your office chair, sweating, and trying to figure out how this happened. I will tell you, it is because you have done nothing. You have de-prioritized security at every turn, resulting in an open door for any hacker to walk through.</p>

<p>Not only have you done nothing, you actually worked against anyone who brought up the topic of API security. You would respond: We don’t have the time. We don’t have the budget. We don’t have the skills. You never listened to anyone of your staff, even that security lady (what was her name?) you had hired last year, and then resigned, with a letter containing over 25 security holes she had been trying to take care of, but because of the toxic environment you’ve created, she was unable to do anything and moved on. You have created an environment where anyone who brings up security concerns feels persecuted, and even that their job is in jeopardy, making “doing nothing” the standard mode across all operations.</p>

<p>You have eight separate mobile applications which all use APIs, and all of them using the customer database in question, which also stores credit cards, which is in violation of your PCI compliance–you know, those forms you sign off on each year? You felt these mobile APIs were secure because they were hidden behind your mobile applications, and your developers had given you a application security scan report last year. In this situation you would love to blame these developers, but all roads lead to you when it comes to responsibility for this situation. You begin to feel sick to your stomach thinking about the 345,633 credit cards and other PII that was leaked. You know the numbers, because you have real time reports on how many customers you have. You just don’t have any real time reports for anything to do with security.</p>

<p>API security was everyones first concern when you first pitched these projects starting back in 2010, and you have managed to run for seven years without any major incidents. Each year you have just been more emboldened in your do nothing strategy, but everything has caught up with you now. What do you do? You don’t have a breach action plan. You don’t have sort of protocol for this type of situation, despite saying that you did several times in meetings. You better get to work dealing with the technical fallout from all of this, because it will last weeks, if not months. Then you get to also start dealing with the business, legal, and political fallout from this breach. Hey, there is a bright spot. The chances are pretty high you might not even have a job after all of this is pretty high as well. Enjoy!</p>

<p>You are in a sweet spot. You got a fat six figure job in the coolest department of your company, building out your API platform. You have a decent budget (never as much as you want) to throw hackathons, run Google and Twitter ads, and you can buy schwag to give away at your events. Sure there is a lot of pressure to deliver, but you are doing pretty well. All you gotta do is convince 3rd party developers to do thing with your companies APIs, develop web, mobile, voice, and other applications that generate buzz and deliver the return on investment your bosses are looking for.</p>

<p>It is all about you and your team. Let’s get to work growth hacking! Attract as may new users as we can, and convince them to build as much as we possibly can. Let’s get them to develop SDKs, write articles for us on their blog, speak at our events, favorite things on hacker news, and whatever activities that we can. Your objective is to extract as much value from your API operations as you possibly can, and give nothing back. Expect developers to work for free. Expect your hackathons attendees to come up with the next great idea, build it, and hand it over to you for very little in return. This isn’t a partnership, this is an API ecosystem, and your team is determined to win at all costs.</p>

<p>Your API isn’t a two-way street. All roads lead to your success, and your bosses getting what they want. You don’t care that 3rd party developers should be compensated, or that they have any rights to their intellectual property. The 5% of them that successfully build applications, we will offer them a job in exchange for it, or we’ll just replicate it internally, decrease their rate limits, and increase their error rates so that they can’t compete. Sure you want people to still feel inspired, but not enough so that they’ll ever be able to sustain their applications–the only sustainable application around here will be owned by the platform. After all, this is all just business–it is nothing personal.</p>

<p>I know that many of you are insecure about your APIs. You aren’t transparent with your numbers, and many aspects of your API operations. You are stressed out because you built it, and nobody came. You were able to artificially inflate your new user numbers, and API calls through paid campaigns, and bot activity, but nobody is using it, and you just can’t figure out why. You are asking yourself why don’t anyone see the value your API brings to the table? Why aren’t you getting the traction you thought you would get when you first came up with the idea?</p>

<p>You aren’t getting any traction with your API because it sucks. It was a bad idea. Nobody wants it. It sucks because it doesn’t provide any value in a highly competitive space, and you naively thought that if you built it everyone would come. You probably have a number of people around you telling you that your idea is great, and the API will be a hit. You’ve probably had this most of your life, and are used to people telling you that your ideas are great. It is why you feel so uncomfortable around anyone that is critical, because you just aren’t used to being told you that your ideas are dumb. It hurts your feelings.</p>

<p>This is why you surround yourself with people who look, act and think like you do. It is why you don’t think women and people of color have the skills needed to work on your dumb, useless ideas. You don’t have the balls to surround yourself with anyone who doesn’t think like you. If you did, you might have been told early on that your idea wasn’t worthwhile, or you might have gotten additional feedback or criticism that would have helped shape it into something useful. I know this is hard for you to hear, and you think you are really smart, and you probably read one of my cheerleader blog posts about how great APIs are, but in reality, if it doesn’t have any use in the real world nobody will care.</p>

<p>Don’t make this mistake with your API. Make sure your API team is as diverse as possible, and then work hard to make sure your community also becomes as inclusive you can. It is a lot more work to do thing this way, but it will pay off, and it will save you from potentially launching an API that completely sucks like this again, and doesn’t have any reach beyond just the echo chamber you exist in.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/35910978054_906047b6cb_z.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>You hear a lot of discussion regarding public API vs private API. From my vantage point there is only web APIs that use public DNS, but I find that folks hung up on the separation usually have many other hangups about things they like to keep behind the firewall, and under the umbrella of private. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/10/my-focus-on-public-apis-applies-internally-as-well/">These are usually the same folks who like to tell me that my public API stories don’t apply to them</a>, and when you engage these folks in any ongoing fashion you tend to find that they are looking to keep a whole lot of dysfunction out of view from the public, and all the talk really has very little to do with APIs.</p>

<p>I spend my days studying the best practices across the leading API providers, and understanding what is working and what is not working when it comes to operating APIs. I have seven years of research I’m happy to share with folks, and I entertain a number requests to jump on calls, participate in webinars, do hangouts, and go onsite to do workshops and talks. I’m usually happy to do these things, and when it is a government agency, non-profit organization, and sometimes higher educational institutions, I am happy to these things at no charge. I like sharing what I know, and letting folks decide what they can use from the knowledge I’ve aggregated.</p>

<p>When I engage with folks I expect folks to not always be trusted–they don’t know me. However, I’m always surprised when folks think I have an agenda, looking to change them too fast, that I’m trying to shove something down their throat, and disrupt their position. First, I am always being invited in. I’m not a sales guy. I do not have anything to sell you except for my knowledge (which revenue goes to just goes back into doing what I do). There is regularly the quiet IT person who has carefully defended their position in the company and what they do not know for years, telling me this is all horse shit, and who do I think I am. Or the administrator who is always running around with their head cut-off, and feels the need to tell me that I do not understand them, and there is no way that any knowledge that I have is at all applicable to them–what the hell am I even doing here?</p>

<p>Hey, I’m just looking to share. If you don’t want it, I’m happy to tell me stories elsewhere, you don’t have to jump my shit. I’m genuinely trying to help, and share stories about what is working in other situations. I’m not looking to take your job, or make you do things you don’t have time or capacity for. Your dysfunction is not my API problem. I’m guessing this dysfunction is probably why you don’t have any sort of public API presence, and why your existing internal and partner APIs are not everything you’d like them to be. I am just going to quietly pick up my things and go back to what I was doing, I’m sorry that I’ve disrupted your chaotic world, and took up your time. I most likely won’t be back, but if you ever need to learn anything about APIs, and need a break, you know where to find me.</p>

<p>I know many of you read my blog for the valuable nuggets of information extracted from my regular research into the world of APIs. I spend a great deal of time sifting through very boring, mundane, and sometimes valuable API related goings on. I have managed to muster the energy each week for the last seven years to sift through thousands of feeds, Tweets, and Github repositories looking for nuggets of API wisdom, best practices, and sometimes bad practices, to share here on the blog. Some weeks I find this an easy task, something I really enjoy the process, but most weeks it is a chore–some weeks I don’t give a shit at all. This is one of those weeks. Well, last week was too, but instead of NO blog posts, this week I’m going to shift things up so that I can get on track.</p>

<p>I have had series of folks piss in my Cheerios lately, regarding the free and unpaid work that I do, and as a result, I find myself without any writing mojo for the second week in a row, and not caring about sifting through all your API startup blah blah blah. 1/3 is about being rude and bro assholes, 1/3 of it is that APIs are boring and y’all have no imagination, and 1/3 of it is I’m a mentally ill asshole. The result of all of this is that you get a week full of API rants, instead of API research. Sooooooo, if this side of my personality turns you off, I recommend you tuning out API Evangelist for at least a week, until I feel better, and find the energy to do what it is that I do. There will still be plenty of substance in my posts, and things will still be VERY API related, and something that you can apply in your regular work, I will just be taking off all filters, and it will be written directly from my brain instead of my API research.</p>

<p>I work really hard doing what I do. I work seven days a week, with no regular paycheck or institutional support. I do make a decent living from partners who step up to support me (and pay their bills), but it is a hustle to keep doing what I do. It always grinds on me when folks with good jobs attack me like I have some sort of agenda in their game, or the no name bros come out of the wood work to question my credibility when they know nothing about me. I spend a lot of time filtering out what I’m really thinking, sticking to the facts, helping make my nuggets of API research wisdom more digestible, but this week ain’t one of them, so hold on. Once I feel better, I will go back to normal, and make sure I point out the good that is going on in the space, but in the current mode y’all ain’t worth it, and I’m going to unload and rant for the next 30 or 40 posts. Normally I’d keep this kind of stuff just on kinlane.com, but since it will all be API focused, I’m going to give you the uncensored version here on apievangelist.com. Enjoy!</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2017</span>

<p>This API operations consideration won’t apply to every API, but for APIs that provide essential resources in a time of need, I wanted to highlight an API rate limit cry for help that came across my desk this weekend. <a href="https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/901658084002713600">Our friend over at Pinboard alerted me</a> to someone in Texas asking for some help in getting Google to increase the Google Maps API rate limits for an app they were depending on as Hurricane Harvey:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/Google">@google</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/googlemaps">@googlemaps</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleMapsAPI">@googlemapsapi</a> can you please remove the limit on api access for <a href="https://twitter.com/ATXfloods">@atxfloods</a>? This is an emergency and we rely on it.</p>&mdash; Jen Savage (@savagejen) <a href="https://twitter.com/savagejen/status/901656342213033984">August 27, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The app they depended on had ceased working and was showing a Google Maps API rate limit error, and they were trying to get the attention of Google to help increase usage limits. As Pinboard points out, it would be nice if Google had more direct support channels to make requests like this, but it would be also great if API providers were monitoring API usage, aware of applications serving geographic locations being impacted, and would relax API rate limiting on their own. There are many reasons API providers leverage their API management infrastructure to make rate limit exceptions and natural disasters seems like it should be top of the list.</p>

<p>I don’t think API providers are being malicious with rate limits in this area. I just think it is yet another area where technologists are blind to the way technology is making an impact (positive or negative) on the world around us. Staying in tune to the needs of applications that help people in their time of need seems like it will have to components, 1) knowing your applications (you should be doing this anyways) and identifying the ones that have a public service, and 2) staying in tune with natural and other disasters that are happening around the world. We see larger platforms like Facebook and Twitter rolling out permanent solutions to assist communities in their times of needs, and it seems like something that other smaller platforms should be tuning into as well.</p>

<p>Disaster support and considerations will be an area of API operations I’m going to consider adding into my research, and spending more time to identify best practices, and what platforms are doing to better serve communities in a time of need using APIs.</p>

<p>I found myself looped into another API patent situation. I’m going to write this up as I would any other patent story, then I will go deeper because of my deeper personal connection to this one, but I wanted to make sure I called this patent what it is, and what ALL API patents are–a bad idea. Today’s patent is for <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20170102925.PGNR.">an automatch process and system for software development kit for application programming interface</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Title: Automatch process and system for software development kit for application programming interface<br /><br />
Patent# : US 20170102925 A1<br /><br />
Abstract: A computer system and process is provided to generate computer programming code, such as in a Software Development Kit (SDK). The SDK generated allows an application to use a given API. An API description interface of the system is operable to receive API-description code describing one or more endpoints of the API. A template interface is operable to receive one or more templates of code defining classes and/or functions in a programming language which can be selected by the selection of a set of templates. A data store is operable to use a defined data structure to store records of API description code to provide a structured stored description of the API. A code generation module is operable to combine records of API with templates of code which are arranged in sets by the language of the code they contain. The combining of records and code from templates may use pointers to a data structure which is common to corresponding templates in different sets to allow templates of selected languages to be combined with any API description stored.<br /><br />

<p>If you have been in the API space for as long as I have you know that the generation of API SDKs using an API definition is not original or new, it is something that has been going on for quite some time, with many open source solutions available on the landscape. It is something everyone does, and there are many services and tooling available out there to deliver SDKs in a variety of languages for your API. It is something that just isn’t patent worthy (if there was such a thing anymore). It shouldn’t exist, and the authors should know better, and the US Patent Office should know better, but in the current digital environment we exist in there isn’t a lot of sensibility and logic when it comes to business in general, let alone intellectual property.</p>

<p>I haven’t pulled any patents as part of my <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">API patent research</a> in some time, so this particular patent hasn’t come across my radar. I was alerted to the patent via a Tweetstorm, shared with me in Slack by Adeel (one of the authors of the patent):</p>

<p>In which my response was, “oh. ouch. well, gonna have to think on this one sir. I’ll let you know my response, but I’m going to guess you might not like how I feel either. I’m not pro-patent. let me simmer on it for a couple days and I’ll share my thoughts.”  As I was simmering I was pulled into the conversation again by Tony Tam:</p>

<p>I was taking my usual time, gathering my thoughts in my notebook. Taking walks. Simmering. Then I wake up Saturday morning to this Tweet:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-cards="hidden" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That looks like a sponsored story to me (given the issues with apimatic generated code).

<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The comment did get me to Tweet a couple times, but ultimately I’m not going to engage or deviate from my initial response to gather my thoughts and write a more thoughtful post. The machine wants me to respond emotionally, fractionally, and in ways that can be taken out of context. This is how the technology space works, and keeps you serving it’s overlords–the money folks behind.</p>

<p>I do have to admit, when I first responded I was going to take a much harder line against APIMATIC, but after seeing the personal attacks on Adeel, his attempts to defend himself, then this no presence Twitter account coming at me personally, bringing into question that maybe I was being paid to write articles I changed the tone of this story significantly. The conversation around this patents shows what is wrong with the business and politics of APIs, more than anything API patents have done to the community to date.</p>

<p>First, Adeel doesn’t understand the entire concept of what Tony meant when he said patent, any more than he grasps what Tony meant by douchbag. This isn’t a jab at Adeel. It’s truth. Adeel is a Pakistani, living in New Zealand. I’ve spent the last couple of years engaging with him in person, and virtually via hangouts, Slack, and email. I’m regularly having to explain some very western concepts to him, and often find myself think deeply about what I’m saying to make sure I am bridging things properly. Not because Adeel isn’t smart (he’s exceptionally smart), it is just because of the cultural divide that exists between him and I.</p>

<p>Adeel didn’t file their patent out of some competitive ambition, or stealing of open source ideas as referenced in the Tweetstorm. He did it because it is what the academic environment where APIMATIC was born encouraged it, and it is something that is associated with smart ideas by the institution. This concept isn’t unique to New Zealand, it is something that still flourishes in the United States. Where the cultural bridge was necessary, is when it comes to why patents are bad. In these academic environments, you have a good idea, you patent it. It is something that historically acceptable, and encouraged. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/06/08/patents-as-a-measure-of-individual-success/">You see this across institutions and within enterprises around the globe, with patents as a measure of individual success</a>. Adeel and his team had a good idea, so they patented it, he didn’t think he was doing anything wrong.</p>

<p>Addeel isn’t being any more aggressive or vindictive <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/12/i-just-cannot-get-behind-api-patents-especially-when-they-apply-to-http-and-hypermedia/">than Sal or Matt were with their hypermedia patents</a>, or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/25/the-unintended-consequences-of-api-patents/">Jon Moore</a> were with their patents. It is what their VCs, companies, and parent institutions encourage them to do with their good ideas (go after them and make your mark on the world). I fault all of these individuals just as much as I fault Adeel, or even Tony for that matter, when it comes to the name of an open source product suddenly becoming a trademarked product. Ironically this conversation is going up, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/22/thank-you-tony/">right after a post regarding how much I respect Tony for his work</a>, despite me be VERY upset about Swagger not remaining attached to an open source product we all had contributed so much to, and helped spread the word about. If we are worried about the sanctity of open source, we should be defending all dimensions of intellectual property. I know, not a perfect comparison, but I imagine Tony feels similar to what I did when this happened. Which I let him know via email, but have never gone after anyone individually, or personally, sicking my dogs on him, although I’m sure it might have felt that way.</p>

<p>All of this makes me think deeper about the relationship between open source and APIs. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/02/what-licensing-should-i-be-considering-when-i-take-open-source-software-and-offer-up-as-an-api/">What are the responsibilities of companies who wrap open source technology with an API and offer a commercial service?</a> How does licensing, trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property concerns need to be respected? I’m guessing I could go through many of the API patents in my research and find thatmost filings that did not consider or respect open source offerings that came before them. People had a good idea. They were in an environment that encourages patents, and they filed for a patent to show their idea was worthwhile–that USPTO stamp of approval is widely recognized as a way to acknowledge your idea is worthy.</p>

<p>I want to make clear. I am not defending patents. I am defending Adeel. I am doing so strongly, because of the no name person who decided to chime in and question the credibility of my API storytelling. Otherwise I would have laid things out, and told Adeel he needed to learn the lesson and move on. I just saw everyone piling on Adeel like he was a bad person, and some tech bro just patenting things to get the upper hand. I have known Adeel for years, and know that is not the situation. Once I started getting piled on as well, then it switched things into personal mode for me, and now I feel the need to defend my friend, but not his actions. The tech community loves to pile on, and I deal with wave after wave of tech bros who don’t read my work and accuse me of things that people who DO read my work would NEVER acuse me of. Adeel is my friend. Adeel is an extremely intelligent, honorable, kind-hearted person, and it pissed me off when people started piling on him.</p>

<p>Now that you understand my personal relationship, let’s address my business relationship. I am an advisor to APIMATIC. Not because I’m paid, or there are stock options, it is because he is my friend. In August (couple of weeks ago), Adeel and his investors had offered me a 0.25% share capital in the company but there has been no paperwork, nothing signed, and no deals made as of today. Honestly, after the $318 check I got for my latest advisory role, which I spent about 60 hours of work on, and travel costs out of my own pocket, I have little interest in pushing the conversations forward to the point where things ever get formalized. It just isn’t a priority for me, and damn sure has never influenced my writing about APIMATIC, let alone a story from June of 2015, like the Tweetstorm participant accused me of, without doing any due diligence on who I am. You are always welcome to ask ANY of my partners if I take money to write positive things about their products, or guest posts, you’ll get the same answer from all of them–it is something I get asked regularly, and just don’t give a shit about doing.</p>

<p>API patents are a bad idea. Patent #US 20170102925 A1, for an automatch process and system for software development kit for application programming interface is a bad idea. API patents are a bad idea because people think they are a sign of being smart when they are not. API patents are a bad idea because corporations, institutions, and organizations keep telling people it is a sign of being smart, and people believe it. API patents are a bad idea because the entire US Patent system is broken, because it is an intellectual property relic of a physical age, being leveraged in a digital realm where things are meant to be interoperable and reusable. API patents are bad idea because y’all keep doing them thinking they are a good idea, when they just open you up to being a tool that allows corporations to lock up ideas, and provide a vehicle for others to use them as leverage in a court of law, and behind closed doors negotiations. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/02/after-looking-through-23414-api-patents-i-think-it-will-just-come-down-to-who-litigates/">Ultimately whether or not patents are bad will come down to who litigates with their patent portfolios, and the patents they acquire</a>. The scariest part is most of this leveraging and strong-arming won’t always happen in a public court, it will happen behind closed doors in arbitration, and with venture capital negotiations.</p>

<p>Which really brings me to the absurdity of this latest patent Tweetstorm. I’m all for showcasing that patents are a bad idea, and even shaming companies and individuals for doing them. However, I saw this one get personal a couple of times, and even took a jab at me. Y’all really shouldn’t do this shit in glass houses, because patents are just part of your intellectual property problems. The NDAs y’all are signing are a bad idea. Those deals you are making with VCs are mostly bad ideas. Y’all are just as ignorant, or maybe in denial about the deals you are making as Adeel is about the negative impacts of the US patent system. Most of these deals you make will result in your startup being wielded in more damaging ways than Adeel’s patent ever will. Yet you keep doing startups, signing deals, and attacking your competition, and people like me just investing in the community. Adeel is currently reading about patents, which I regret to say won’t provide him with the answers he is looking for. There are few books on the subject. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=lawrence+lessig">Maybe reading something from Lawrence Lessig might get you part of the way there</a>. The real answers you are looking for come from experience, and that is what you just received. This was an easy lesson, just wait until APIMATIC acquired by a bigco, and see your patents wielded in ways you never imagined–those will be some harder lessons.</p>

<p>I don’t have a problem with calling out Adeel for APIMATIC’s patent–it is what should happen. I have a problem with him being called douchbag, and the other personal attacks, and assumptions on his (and my) character that occurred within the Tweetstorm. By all means, call him out on Twitter. By all means, educate him around the damage to OSS and API community by doing patents. Don’t make these things personal, assume malicious intent, and recklessly begin questioning the character of everyone involved. Also, if you are just spending your time calling out you competitors for this behavior, because it bothers you, and you don’t call out your partners, and the companies you work for, and the services you use for their abusive use of OSS and damaging intellectual property claims, you have significantly weakened your argument, and won’t always be able to count on me to jump into the discussion and have your back. I do this shit full time, with no financial backing, corporate or institutional cover. I’m out here full time, not hiding behind a Twitter handle, holding folks accountable whenever and wherever I can. If you are doing a startup, learn from this story. Educate your institutions, companies, and investors about how API patents are damaging everything we are doing, and never will actually demonstrate you have a novel idea, it is just locking up other ideas.</p>

<p>In the end, everything we know as API is already patented. <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">Look through the thousands of API patents in my research</a>. Hell, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/06/06/patent-api-descriptions/">Microsoft already has the patent on API definitions</a>, so what does it matter if there is a patent on generating SDKs from API definitions? Also, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/25/doing-the-research-in-preparation-for-my-patent-on-a-patent-api/">my patent on API patents is pending</a>, so it will all be game over then. Mwahahaha!! ;-) As Tony said, the patent system is broken. Let’s keep letting our companies, organizations, institutions, and most importantly the USPTO know that it is broken. Let’s keep calling out folks who still think API patents are a good idea (sorry Adeel), and schooling them on the why, but let’s not be dicks about it. Let’s not assume people have bad intentions. Let’s understand the history of patents and that many people are still taught that they are a sign of having good ideas and being what you do as part of regular business operations. Let’s just make sure we also lead by building a better API service or tooling, as Adeel brought up in his defense. Also, when he said this, he wasn’t making this an APIMATIC is better than Swagger Codegen (or others), he is just focused on making a better product in general. I’m sorry but he has. Y’all can focus on the merits of Swagger Codegen vs. APIMATIC, but what he’s done with the SDK docs, portal, and continuous integration, ARE great improvements. Much like the commercial service Swagger has become (ya know, the Swagger in Swagger Codegen) and evolved on top of the open source API specification and tooling Tony set into motion for ALL of us to build upon–thanks again Tony.</p>

<p>P.S. I wouldn’t have been so hard on Tony if I hadn’t been looped in to defend intellectual property and OSS like this.<br />
P.S.S. I wouldn’t have been so easy on Adeel, if no name McTwitter account had accused me of selling out when I don’t do that.<br />
P.S.S.S. Adeel, patents are bad because people use them in bad ways, and the US Patent Office is underfunded, understaffed, and can’t tell what is good or bad patents–this is the way bigcos want them.<br />
P.S.S.S.S. Sorry I’m such an asshole everyone, but I hope y’all are getting somewhat used to it after seven years.<br /></p>

<p>**Disclosure: **I am an advisor to APIMATIC (very proud of it)!</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.ukiahdailyjournal.com/article/NP/20170810/NEWS/170819962"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/weed/mendocino-county-split-from-state-on-cannabis+track-and-trace.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>Counties across the State of California are scrambling to get everything in order now that marijuana is legal, and <a href="http://www.ukiahdailyjournal.com/article/NP/20170810/NEWS/170819962">the 3rd party vendors working with the state are using an API to try and bridge the regulatory needs of each county,</a> as they look to regulate the brand new industry. It sounds like the marijuana regulatory API isn’t 100% ready for prime time, but it is interesting to hear that state is looking to “mitigate the burden of counties” when it comes to production of marijuana using APIs.</p>

<p>I have been curating news about APIs in use across the growing marijuana industry, but this is the fist story I’ve written on the subject. Now that I’m seeing APIs use as part of the regulatory engine for the industry, things are getting a little more real, and not just be about finding seeds, stores, and other industry data. I’ll keep scratching around to see what I can find out about the software vendors mentioned in the article, and see if I can get my hands on any documentation, or a link to any active portal. I’m curious to see where this marijuana regulatory API train is headed.</p>

<p>Since the marijuana industry is a completely new one for cities, counties, and states to manage, there is an opportunity to leverage new technology like APIs as part of the interactions between government entities, with the help of 3rd party providers. <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/05/05/taxation-on-public-data-via-the-api-management-layer/">Maybe there is even some opportunity for revenue generation on top of these APIs, allowing for government to fund the software development in a way that it could also be used across other government systems</a>. Push things forward with the rollout and expansion of the marijuana industry, and use that to fund other government systems that lack the funds, and are often years behind. The problems states face in working with counties doesn’t stop with this new marijuana industry, and there are so many other aspects of government operations that could benefit from APIs helping “mitigate the burden of counties” trying to comply with state laws and regulations.</p>

<p>I am preparing a training section of my API Evangelist research, and part of the process involves learning about what other API providers and API service providers are up to in this area. On my list to look through is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blueprint">Facebook Blueprint</a>, their training area for the platform. The courses present there aren’t specifically for the Facebook API, and is targeting primarily business uses, but the approach translates to API focused training materials, and showcases what is a priority for Facebook when it comes to educating their platform consumers.</p>

<p>As part of my API training research I want to understand the building blocks employed by Facebook so that I can apply as part of my API Evangelist training efforts, and help other API providers and service providers apply as part of their operations as well. Here are a few of the API training building blocks I found present:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Courses</strong> - A variety of online courses that teach you about everything Facebook.</li>
  <li><strong>Webinars</strong> - The webinars they provide around the content they are publishing.</li>
  <li><strong>Live</strong> - The live, in person workshops and courses they provide around the world.</li>
  <li><strong>Case Studies</strong> - Case studies of companies who have used Facebook courses.</li>
  <li><strong>Press</strong> - Press about the Facebook Blueprint, and how they are spreading the word.</li>
  <li><strong>Certifications</strong> - Facebook specific certifications that you can archive.</li>
  <li><strong>Exams</strong> - The tests that are available around the facebook courses.</li>
  <li><strong>How it Works</strong> - Some details about how Facebook training works.</li>
  <li><strong>Policies</strong> - The legal side of things, covering all of our bases.</li>
  <li><strong>FAQ</strong> - Some of the frequently asked questions around the training platform.</li>
  <li><strong>Support &amp; Help</strong> - Where you can get support and more help when it comes to training.</li>
</ul>

<p>Facebook breaks down their training into course categories and learning paths, providing two main ways for potential students to find what they are looking for. Facebook Blueprint provides…well, a blueprint that other API providers and service providers can consider when pulling together your trainings for your API training. Providing online, and offline courses is just the start, and as Facebook shows, there are some additional building blocks that need to be present for it to work.</p>

<p>I have some other API platform training areas to go through before I settle in on a strategy for my own API Evangelist training efforts. Ultimately I want my approach to become a blueprint that my customers can put to work. I’m even looking to turn my API training blueprint into a course by itself, so that I can help some of my customers with their training efforts, and even train the trainers in some situations, providing them with course content, and the awareness of the API space they need to be successful delivering courses within their company, organizations, institution, and government agency. In 2018, I’m investing in my storytelling on API Evangelist, as well as industry guides, white papers, and training material for my readers, and privately wherever it is needed.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/290x195cloudsecurity2014.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p><a href="http://gearsofbiz.com/carbon-black-edr-service-exposing-customer-data-through-cloud-scanning-update/7096">I was reading about how Carbon Black, an endpoint detection and response (EDR) service, was exposing customer data via a 3r party API service they were using</a>. The endpoint detection and response provider allows customers to optionally scan system and program files using the VirusTotal service. Carbon Black did not realize that premium subscribers of the VirusTotal service get access to the submitted files, allowing an company or government agency with premium access to VirusTotal’s application programming interface (API) can mine those files for sensitive data.</p>

<p>It provides a pretty scary glimpse at the future of privacy and security in a world of 3rd party APIs if we don’t think deeply about the solutions we bake into our applications and services. Each API we bake into our applications should always be scrutinized for privacy and security concerns, making sure end-users aren’t being subjected to unnecessary situations. This situation sounds like it was both API provider and consumer contributing to the privacy violation, and adjusting platform access levels, and communicating with API consumers would be the best path forward.</p>

<p>Beyond just this situation, I wanted to write about this topic as a cautionary tale for the unfolding machine learning API landscape. Make sure we are thinking deeply about what data and content we are making available to platforms via artificial intelligence and machine learning APIs. Make sure we are asking the hard questions about the security and privacy of data and content we are running through machine learning APIs. Make sure we are thinking deeply about what data and content sets we are running through the machine learning APIs, and reducing any unnecessary exposure of personal data, content, and media.</p>

<p>It is easy to be captivated by the magic of artificial intelligence and machine learning APIs. It is easy to view APIs as something external, and not much of a privacy or security threat. However, with each API call we are inviting a 3rd party API into our databases, files, and other private systems. Let’s make sure we have an honest conversation with our API providers about how data and content is accessed, stored, cached, and used as part of any AI or ML process. Let’s make sure we get clarification on which partners, or other 3rd party providers are getting access to data and content that is indexed and executed as part of AI and ML API requests and responses. How long are videos or images stored? How long is data stored?</p>

<p>I’m seeing more discussion around dependencies going on in the API space. Which software libraries, and APIs are we depending on for our applications and services. I’m feeling like this conversation is going to continue expanding and security, privacy, and observability is going to become a more significant part of these dependency discussions. It will be a conversation that continues to push API deployment on-premise, and on-premise, being observable about how ML and AI API operations are being logged, stored, and track on. I’m going to keep watching how APIs are intentionally or unintentionally violating security and privacy like this, and keep an eye on the API dependency conversation to see how it evolves as part of this security and privacy discussion.</p>

<p>Tony Tam, the creator of the OpenAPI specification, formerly known as Swagger, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-say-goodbye-swagger-smartbear-openapi-whats-next-tony-tam">has announced he will be exiting his role at OAI and SmartBear</a>. Tony says the specification is in good hands with Ron Ratovsky (<a href="https://twitter.com/webron">@webron</a>), Darrel Miller (<a href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">@darrel_miller</a>), and others in the OAI. Tony doesn’t give any hints about what he’ll be up to, but will be walking away from his baby entirely.</p>

<p>I have given Tony a hard time during the transition from Wordnik to SmartBear, and the creation of the OpenAPI, but I am a huge fan of what he has done, and super bummed to see him go–hoping he won’t leave the API community completely. There are many building blocks that go into doing APIs and OpenAPI, or Swagger, is the most significant single building block that has emerged in the seven years I’ve been doing API Evangelist. Swagger has had a profound impact on the world of APIs, and OpenAPI will continue doing this in the future, if the right conditions are still present across the API landscape.</p>

<p>Swagger has helped us talk about our APIs. Swagger has helped us collaborate around our APIs. Swagger has opened up a whole lifecycle of API tooling to help us along our journey. I always felt like Swagger reflected Tony’s personality, and with it’s evolution to OpenAPI, and the OpenAPI Initiative means it’s grown beyond it’s creator. OpenAPI is in good hands. I think it is a good time for Tony to step away, and feel like his baby has begun to grow up, becoming much bigger than what he can do on his own (even with Ron’s amazing help).</p>

<p>Thank you for all your work Tony. You made your mark on the API space. You managed to develop something that was useful for API documentation and code generation, but quickly became about design, testing, monitoring, and every other stops along the API lifecycle. I am stoked to have had the chance to work with you, and spend time telling stories about your important work. I hope you find some time to read some good books, and take time for yourself, and hopefully you don’t go to far from the API space, or at least come back and visit from time to time.</p>

<p>I was doing some more work on my list of potential female speakers from the API space. I have some slots to fill for @APIStrat, and I saw another API event was looking for suggestions when it came to speakers. A perfect time to invest some more cycles into finding female API talent. Twitter and Github is always where I go for discovery. I picked up where I left off working on this last time, turned on my search tools that use the Twitter and Github API, and got to work enriching the algorithm that drives my API talent search.</p>

<p>Next up on my task list was to <a href="https://api-evangelist-data.github.io/names/">deploy a name microservice,</a> that would help me filter Twitter and Github users by gender. I’m interested in API folks of all type, but for this round I need to be able to weight by female. <a href="http://names.mongabay.com/">I found a list of the top names from the United States which had them broken down by gender</a>. I copied and pasted into a Google Sheet, fired up a Github repository, and published the spreadsheet of data to Github as YAML–giving me a <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-data/names/blob/master/_data/male.yaml">male.yaml</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-data/names/blob/master/_data/female.yaml">female.yaml</a> listing of names. I will be be use these names in a variety of web and API applications, but I wanted to be able to help filter any search results by a female name for this project. I understand the limitations of this approach, but it is good enough for what I am looking to accomplish today.</p>

<p>Next, I use <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-data/names/blob/master/_data/female.yaml">my new name microservice</a> as a filter for any Twitter or Github account I’m paying attention to as part of my API monitoring. Quickly giving me a list of accounts to look through as I am developing my list of women doing interesting things with APIs. Once I’m done I have a list of Twitter accounts, and Github accounts, I prepare them as a Google Sheet, then get ready to publish the YAML within a Github repository as my API women microservice. Then I pause. Should I be doing this? In this current online environment do I want to be building out lists of women, without their consent? Sure their Twitter and Github accounts are public, but should I be singling them out in an easy to access list? IDK.</p>

<p>I am doing this work for my @APIStrat conference, and I want to share the information easily with other conference folks. I also want to showcase women doing interesting things in the API space. However, I don’t want to help automate the targeting and harassment of these women. By publishing a machine readable list of their Twitter and Github accounts I’m doing the heavy lifting for any potential online troll. I’m going to simmer on this one for a week. Luckily I can easily publish the list as a private repository, and share with anyone who asks using Github, by just adding them as collaborator on the repository. This situation has reminded me that with each microservice that I publish I should be pausing and always asking myself if I should be doing this in the first place. What are the possibilities for abuse? Am I potentially making someone unsafe with the service I publishing?</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/15/where-to-begin-with-webhooks-for-the-human-services-data-api/">I was doing some webhooks research as part of my human services work</a> and I found myself studying the types of events used as part of webhook orchestration for <a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/">Github</a>, <a href="https://developer.box.com/reference#event-triggers">Box</a>, <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#event_types">Stripe</a>, and <a href="https://api.slack.com/events/api">Slack</a>. Each of the event type lists for each of these platforms tell a lot about what is possible with each API, and the webhooks that get triggered as part of these events show what is important to developers who are integrating with each of these APIs. These event type lists really help make sense of the API activity for each of these APIs, providing a nice list to follow when developing your integration strategy.</p>

<p>What I really like as I look through each of these webhook event lists is that they are usually in pretty plain language, describing events that matter, not just row updates with a timestamp. These events can be very broad, triggering a webhook when anything happens to a resource, or it could be granular and be all about a specific type of change, or anything in between. Each event type represents something API consumers want from an API, and would be normally polling the API for, but since there are webhook events, developers can get a push of data or a ping whenever an event occurs.</p>

<p>Another thing that the presence of webhooks, and a robust list of events represent for me is the maturity of a platform. Github, Box, Stripe, and Slack are all very mature and robust platforms. There are meaningful events defined, and the platform behaves as a two way street, accepting requests, but also making requests whenever a meaningful event occurs. I’m getting to a place where I feel like basic webhook infrastructure should be default for all API providers. The problem is I don’t think there are well enough defined models for API providers to follow when they are planning this part of their API operations. Something we will need to tackle as an industry pretty soon, helping make sure webhooks behave in consistent ways, and have a standard API interface for orchestrating with.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/drone-recovery/diamond04.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I was in Colorado this last week at a CA internal gathering listening to my friend Erik Wilde talking about APIs. One concept he touched on was what he called API gardening, where different types of API providers approached the planting, cultivating, and maintenance of their gardens in a variety of different ways. I really like this concept, and will be working my way through the slide deck from his talk, and see what else I can learn from his work.</p>

<p>As he was talking I was thinking about a project I had just published to Github, which leverages the Google Sheets API, and the Github API to publish data as YAML, so I could publish as a simple set of static APIs. I’d consider this approach to be more about foraging and wildcrafting, then it is about tending to my API garden. My API garden just happens spread across a variety of services, often free and public space, in many different regions. I will pay for a service when it is needed, but I’d rather tend smaller, wilder, APIs, that grow in existing spaces–in the cracks.</p>

<p>I use free services, and build upon the APIs for the services I am already using. I publish calendars to Google Calendar, then pull data and public APIs using the Google APIs. I use the Flickr and Instagram APIs for storing, publishing, sharing, and integrating with my applications using their APIs. I pull data from the Twitter API, Reddit API, and store in Google Sheets. All of these calendar, image, messaging, and link data will ultimately get published to Github as YAML, which then is shared as XML, JSON, Atom, CSV via static APIs. I am always foraging for data using public services, then planting the seeds, and wildcrafting other APIs–in hopes something will eventually grow.</p>

<p>Right now Github is my primary jam, but since I’m just publishing static JSON, XML, YAML, and other media types, it can be hosted anywhere. Since it’s Github it can be integrated anywhere, directly via the static API paths I generate, or by actually cloning the underlying Github repository. I have a Jekyll instance that I can run on AWS EC2 instance or Docker container, and will be experimenting more with Dropbox, Google Drive, and other free, or low cost storage solutions that have a public component. I’m looking to have a whole toolbox of deployment options when it comes to publishing my data and content APIs across the landscape. Most of these are low use, long tail usage data and content I’m using across my storytelling, so I’m not worried about things being heavily manicured, just providing fruit in a sustained way for as low of a price as I possibly can.</p>

<p>Deploying an API is an interesting concept that I’ve noticed folks struggle with a little bit when I bring it up. My research into API deployment was born back in 2011 and 2012 when my readers would ask me  which API management provider would help them deploy an API. How you actually deploy an API varies pretty widely from company to company. Some rely on gateways to deploy and API from an existing backend system. Some hand-craft their own API using open source API frameworks like <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/partners/tyk-logo.png">Tyk</a> and deploy alongside your existing web real estate. Others rely on software as a services solutions like <a href="http://apis.how/5ytnitnakm">Restlet</a> and <a href="http://apis.how/bgdteovduo">Dreamfactory</a> to connect to a data or content source and deploy an API in the clouds.</p>

<p>Many folks I talk with simply see this as developing their APIs. I prefer to break out development into define, design, deploy, and then ultimately manage. In my experience, a properly defined and designed API can be deployed into a variety of environments. The resulting OpenAPI or other definition can be used to generate server side code necessary to deploy an API, or maybe used in a gateway solution like AWS API Gateway. For me, API deployment isn’t just about the deployment of code behind a single API, it includes the question about where we are deploying the code, acknowledging that there are many places available when it comes to deploying our API resources.</p>

<p>API deployment can be permanent, ephemeral, or maybe just a sandbox. API deployment can be in a Docker container, which by default deploys APIs for controlling the underlying compute for the API you deploying. Most importantly, API deployment should be a planned, well-honed event. APIs should be able to be redeployed, load-balanced, and taken down without friction. It can be easy to find one way of deploying APIs, maybe using similar practices surrounding web deployments, or dependent on one gateway or cloud service. Ideally, API deployment comes in many shapes and sizes, and is something that can occur anywhere in the clouds, on-premise, or on-device. Pushing our boundaries when it comes to which platforms we use, which programming languages we speak, and what API deployment means.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/08/18/http-status-codes-and-the-politics-of-apis/">HTTP Status Codes And The Politics Of APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/runscope/runscope-200-ok.jpeg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>The more I learn about the world of APIs, the more I understand how technology, business, and politics are all woven together into one often immovable monolith. Many things in the world of APIs seem purely like a technical thing, but in reality they are wrapped in, and wielded intentionally and unintentionally as part of larger business, and sometimes a personal agenda. An example of this can be found with the presence, or lack of presence with HTTP status codes, which the default status is usually 200 OK, 404 not found, or 500 internal error.</p>

<p>While these seem like very granular technical details of whether or not an HTML, XML, CSV, or JSON document is returned or not as part of a single web request, there usage often dictates what is happening behind the firewall, and often times more importantly, what is not happening. I find people’s awareness that HTTP status codes exist (or not) a significant sign of their view of the wider web world. If they are aware they exist they most likely have some experience engaging with other experienced partners using the web. If they don’t, they most likely live a pretty isolated existence–even if they do have a web presence.</p>

<p>Beyond just knowing that HTTP status codes exist, understanding the importance of, and the nuance surrounding each individual one demonstrates you are used to engaging with external actors at scale, leveraging web technology. I have to put out there that I DO NOT have an intimate knowledge of all HTTP status codes, because I have not exercised them as part of large scale projects, but it is something I do grasp the scope and importance of from the projects I have worked on. This is not a boolean thing, you knowing HTTP status codes or not. This is the result of many journeys, with many partners, across many different types of digital resources. You can tell how many journeys someone has been on, based on how they view, and wield HTTP status codes.</p>

<p>I encounter folks in my journeys who are dismissive of my focus on HTTP status codes, but I find most of these folks to be purposely vague in the signals they regularly send, and are used to keeping things complex, inconsistent, or just never very well defined so that they can keep things suiting their changing desire and needs. This is something that works well internally, and within a small group of trusted partners, but it rarely is conducive to doing business at scale on the web. Some companies thrive in chaos, because they have the upper hand. They have defined the chaos, and benefit from being in the know of how the chaos works, and invest heavily in keeping a gap between themselves, and those who are not in the know. Forcing external entities to always be on their toes when it comes to understanding what is going on, unable to truly ever know if things are indeed 200 OK, or most likely just a 500 internal server error.</p>

<p>In this situation I always think of my friend Darrel Miller (<a href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">@darrel_miller</a>) who as an API architect can recite every single HTTP status code, and a usage scenario because of his vast knowledge of APIs and web standards. However, a side effect of this reality is that if you ask Darrel almost any question, you will get a real honest, direct, and usually very precise answer. Some folks might look at this as Darrel not having filters, or often possessing too many opinions, but I’m a big fan of his approach. With Darrel, you rarely ever unclear about his motivations, feelings, and experience with any topic. I find this world much easier to navigate than the vague, unclear, often purposely obfuscated responses I get from some companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies I work with. When doing business at scale on the web it always helps to provide clear signals that have a shared meaning, and being precise and upfront with what is going on behind the scenes, not hiding behind the black, white, and grey nature of just 200, 404, and 500.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/uspto/uspto-pair-bulk-data-api.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I stumbled across <a href="https://pairbulkdata.uspto.gov/">the Patent Application Information Retrieval Bulk Data API</a> from the US Patent Office the other day. It provides a much more usable approach to getting at patent information than what I am using at the moment. Right now I am downloading XML files and searching for the occurrence of a handful of keywords. If I want to make a change I have to fire up a new AWS instance, change the code, and reprocess the downloaded files. The Patent Application Information Retrieval Bulk Data API gives me a much more efficient interface to work with.</p>

<p>The Patent Application Information Retrieval Bulk Data API contains the bibliographic, published document and patent term extension data tabs in Public PAIR from 1981 to present, with some additional data dating back to 1931. It has leveraged COTS semantics, maintains an open architecture, and the query syntax follows the standard Apache Solr search syntax, with API responses following the Solr formats. Providing for a much more powerful interface for querying patent data, which goes back further back in time then what I’ve been doing currently. I’m really interested in doing an API patent search for the 1990s, or maybe even earlier.</p>

<p>The Patent Application Information Retrieval Bulk Data API is a well designed API, <a href="https://pairbulkdata.uspto.gov/swagger/index.html">with an attractive API portal and documentation</a>, driven with an OpenAPI. The USPTO provide access to the patent data in the way that I think all government agencies should be doing it. You can use the API, or get at a JSON or XML download of the data. The API is “part of the US Patent and Trademark Office’s (USPTO) commitment to fostering a culture of open government as described by the 2013 Executive Order to make open and machine-readable data the new default for government information.” Which is pretty cool in my book, something we desperately are needing to become a reality across all federal agencies in 2017.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/subway-map-15.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>It isn’t often that I make up acronyms, terms, or phrases. <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/27/merging-api-automation-and-interoperability-into-api-reciprocity/">For a number of years I pushed forward the concept of API reciprocity</a>, but eventually conceded to the notion of integration platform as a service (iPaaS). Even with this failure I’m playing around with the evolution a new concept around how we map out our entire API operations, an area we commonly call the API lifecycle, but I’m exploring with calling it API transit.</p>

<p>When I think about the API lifecycle I am regularly reminded that it is something that is rarely a linear thing from define to deprecation, or even something that goes round and round in a circular format as the name lifecycle implies. This always brings me back to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/01/my-turkey-holiday-project-a-subway-map-api/">my API subway map work</a>, with the development of <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/">my subway map API</a>, and <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">the keynote I gave on the subject at APIStrat in Austin</a>. The subway map concept provides a pretty comprehensive way to map out the unlimited directions in which an API operations might take, and I’m looking to see if it can handle both the provider side needs, as well as that of the API consumer.</p>

<p>While I like the subway map analogy, I really like the more general concept of API transit. The concept of an APi subway map seems one dimensional, where API transit seems like it could handle multiple dimensions. I’m not sure there is a fit here, but I wanted to explore the definition of transit, as well as use the phrase in some API storytelling to test out a little bit, and see if it even is coherent. Ok, so what do my friends over at <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/documentation">the Oxford Dictionaries API</a> have to say on the subject?</p>

<p>etymologies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>late Middle English (denoting passage from one place to another): from Latin transitus, from transire ‘go across’</li>
</ul>

<p>definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the carrying of people or things from one place to another</li>
  <li>the conveyance of passengers on public transport.</li>
  <li>the action of passing through or across a place</li>
</ul>

<p>I like the idea that API transit could be about the process of carrying people (users data) or things (anything digital) from one place to another – with an API transmit map helping visualize this. I like that the map can be used by API providers as a guide for all the stops along the API lifecycle, but instead of being linear or circular, it can be all the above. Each API transit line could visualize an API lifecycle, and help API providers deliver consistently along each layer of API operations. The same maps, and lines can also be used to help API consumers navigate all API resources available via any API transit district.</p>

<p>“Denoting passage from one place to another” could be applied to training API providers about what is now called the API lifecycle, but could also be a series of journeys along pre-specified API transit lines, teaching them about concepts around API design, deployment, management, testing, and other aspects of API operations. These same lines can be used to guide each stop along the API lifecycle, helping act as an assembly line for delivering, maintaining, and even deprecating APIs. Once APIs make it to production, the same API transit map can be used to help engage with API consumers, helping move the people and their things from one place to another.</p>

<p>I’m not 100% sold on the concept, and it is something I’m not sure I will keep using. I do want to invest more time into my API subway map, which I’m going to rebrand as API transit map for the next wave of development. I have the API working, I just need to get the routing to work properly, so that it will lay down each of my API transit lines in a coherent way, allowing them to overlap, and work with and around each other. I have a model in my head for how I can use to help teach folks about key concepts of API operations from definition to deprecation. I also have a model for how it can guide the delivery and management of APIs, acting as a map and framework for managing API operations. I just don’t have the API consumer portion of the equation. I’m guessing it will take me another couple years before this comes into focus for me, but I still enjoy working on the concept, and pushing it forward a little bit each year.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/16/the-importance-of-api-stories/">Earlier this week at the CA API Academy virtual gathering I spoke at in Boulder CO</a>, the question around why there aren’t more API focused agencies came up. We were talking about the need for consulting services around common areas of API operations like design, deployment, management, testing, as well as training around API lifecycle related topics. We are seeing some movement in the area of API focused agencies, but not enough to cover the current demand.</p>

<p>We are seeing full service shops like <a href="http://apivista.com/about/">APIvista</a>, and <a href="https://goodapi.co/">Good API</a> emerge. There is also movement on the agency level when it comes to integration platform as a service (iPaaS), over at <a href="https://lefthookdigital.com/">Left Hook Digital</a>, helping companies leverage Zapier, and integrate with API platforms. There is definitely significant movement in the number of API focused agencies, but we are going to need more to meet the demand for API design, deployment, management, testing, and other stops along the API lifecycle.</p>

<p>I’m guessing it will take a couple years for this side of the API business to mature. Then I’m figuring we will begin see to see more specialized API agencies emerge, helping with evangelism, support, API design, and maybe even industry focused iPaaS, similar to what we are seeing with LeftHook. As mainstream companies are waking up to the potential of APIs, they are going to need a lot of professional help to ensure they are successful in their API journey. We are going to need a number of general service, specialized, regional, and industry specific API agencies to help get us through the next couple of years.</p>

<p>I am focusing on trying to scale the API training portion of this need. I am ramping up development of API training courses that span my API lifecycle and API stack research. Helping API providers and consumers navigate the world of APIs. I’m talking with partners about working together to develop and distribute API training, and will be working to train some trainers at SMB, SME, and the enterprise. Eventually I’m guessing we will also be needing some API focused training agencies to help carry the load in being the last mile of delivery the API curriculum we will be developing.</p>

        <p>I am preparing a talk for tomorrow, and I needed a new list of each stop along the API lifecycle, and since each of my project exist as Github repositories, and are defined as a YAML and JSON data store, I can simply define a new liquid template for generating a new HTML listing of all the stops along the API lifecycle–after generating this list I figured I’d share here as a story.</p>

<p>Here are the 85 stops along the API lifecycle landscape from my vantage point as the API Evangelist:</p>

<p>I’m always presenting <a href="http://apievangelist.com/api-lifecycle/">my API lifecycle research</a> as a listing, or in a linear fashion. I always feel like I should be creating an actual lifecycle visualization, but then I always end up feeling like I should just invest in my subway API map work, and create more robust way to represent how the API lifecycle truly looks.</p>

<p>Anyways, these 85 areas represent the scope of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/api-lifecycle/">my API industry research</a>, and provide a framework for thinking about not just the individual API lifecycle, but also the bigger picture of our API operations and partnerships. Not all of these areas apply to every API provider, but they do provide one perspective of the API landscape that all API providers can learn from. If there are any other stops along the lifecycle you think should be represented, I’d love to hear your thoughts. For example, I’m looking at adding two new areas: 1) training, and 2) fake. Helping me track on how API providers are training internally, with partners, and 3rd party developers, as well as think about the world of API driven fake news, products, advertising, users, and other illnesses emerging across the landscape.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://webhooks.apievangelist.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-asterisk.png" align="right" width="30%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I have been studying the approach of a variety of webhook implementations in preparation for an API consulting project I’m working on. Even though I’m very familiar with how webhooks works, and confident in my ability to design and develop a solution, I’m ALWAYS looking to understand what leading API providers are up to, and how I can improve my knowledge and awareness.</p>

<p>With his round of research, Github has provided me with several webhook nuggets for my API storytelling notebook. One of their web features I though was the notion of a wildcard webhook event:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/">Wildcard Event</a> - We also support a wildcard (*) that will match all supported events. When you add the wildcard event, we’ll replace any existing events you have configured with the wildcard event and send you payloads for all supported events. You’ll also automatically get any new events we might add in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have been working to identify a set of objects and associated webhook events, and the notion of a wildcard event is interesting. It seems like you could apply this globally, or to specific objects / resources, allowing you to get pushes for any events that occur. I’m not sure I’ll have time to apply this feature in my current project, but it is worth adding to my webhook toolbox for future projects.</p>

<p>There are three other features I’ve extracted from Github’s approach to webhooks that I’ve added to my API storytelling notebook, to hopefully craft into future blog posts. I’ll be adding these all as potential webhook building blocks that API providers can consider. I’m hoping to find some more time and money to invest into <a href="http://webhooks.apievangelist.com">my webhook research</a> this fall, and be able to publish a formal guide for the world of webhooks. I’m always surprised by the lack of formal guidance when it comes to webhooks, and is something I’d like to see change in the near future.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/08/16/the-importance-of-api-stories/">The Importance Of API Stories</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/photos/ca-panel.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I am an API storyteller before am an API architect, designer, or evangelist. My number one job is to tell stories about the API space. I make sure there is always (almost) 3-5 stories a day published to API Evangelist about what I’m seeing as I conduct my research on the sector, and thoughts I’m having while consulting and working on API projects. I’ve been telling stories like this for seven years, which has proven to me how much stories matter in the world of technology, and the worlds that it is impacting–which is pretty much everything right now.</p>

<p>Occasionally I get folks who like to criticize what I do, making sure I know that stories don’t matter. That nobody in the enterprise or startups care about stories. Results are what matter. Ohhhhh reeeaaaly. ;-) I hate to tell you, it is all stories. VC investment in startups is all about the story. The markets all operate on stories. Twitter. Facebook. LinkedIn. Medium. TechCrunch. It is all stories. The stories we tell ourselves. The stories we tell each other. The stories we believe. The stories we refuse to believe. It is all stories. Stories are important to everything.</p>

<p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">The mythical story about Jeff Bezos’s mandate that all employees needed to use APIs</a> internally is
still 2-3% of my monthly traffic, down from 5-8% for the last couple of years, and it was written in 2012 (five years ago). I’ve seen this story on the home page of the GSA internal portal, and framed hanging on the wall in a bank in Amsterdam. Stories are important. Stories are still important when they aren’t true, or partially true, like the Amazon mythical tale is(n’t). Stories are how we make sense of all this abstract stuff, and turn it into relatable concepts that we can use within the constructs of our own worlds. Stories are how the cloud became a thing. Stories are why microservices and Devops is becoming a thing. Stories are how GraphQL wants to be a thing.</p>

<p>For me, most importantly, telling stories is how I make sense of the world. If I can’t communicate something to you here on API Evangelist, it isn’t filed away in my mental filing cabinet. Telling stories is how I have made sense of the API space. If I can’t articulate a coherent story around API related technology, and it just doesn’t make sense to me, it probably won’t stick around in my storytelling, research, and consulting strategy. Stories are everything to me. If they aren’t to you, it’s probably because you are more on the receiving end of stories, and not really influencing those around you in your community, and workplace. Stories are important. Whether you want to admit it or not.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-alphabet-apple.png" align="right" width="25%" style="padding: 15px" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/07/24/first-handful-of-lessons-using-my-google-sheet-github-approach/">I’m working on a number of API courses and lessons lately</a>. Some of these are API 101 courses, while others are more advanced courses for the seasoned API provider, and consumer. As I think about what is needed when it comes to classes and workshops across the API sector, I’m considering doing an API Kindergarten series, where business and IT leaders can learn the basics of doing business with APIs.</p>

<p>The curriculum for the API kindergarten program include hands on lessons on how to play nicely, get along with others, the importance of sharing, and helping them learn the important soft skills like not shitting your pants. I’m always surprised at the lack of basic skills by company, organizational, institutional, and government leadership when it comes to the essentials of why APIs work, and think a little primer on things might help some realize they shouldn’t be doing APIs in the first place, or maybe prevent some major crisis down the road.</p>

<p>The number of folks who tell me directly that they are all in on this API thing, yet when it comes to practice clearly are not has grown significantly in 2017. I feel like we need a whole series or curriculum to help make sure business and IT leadership is up for the challenge is desperately needed. Just wait, until I begin working on my sex edit course for the middle schoolers, where we teach them about safely integrating, and what is appropriate API behavior, and what is not. Honestly, I could spend days finding equivalences between the real world and doing APIs (not real world) and creating classes around them–fun stuff!</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2017</span>
        <p>I spend a lot of time monitoring API platforms, thinking about different ways of identifying which ones are taking control of the conversation around how their platforms operate. One example of this out in the wild can be found when it comes to bots, by doing a quick look at which of the major bot platforms own the conversation around this automation going on via their platforms.</p>

<p>First you take a look at Twitter, by doing a quick Google search for Twitter Bots:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bots/bots-twitter-search.png" align="center" width="65%" /></p>

<p>Then you take a look at Facebook, by doing a quick Google search for Facebook Bots:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bots/bots-facebook-search.png" align="center" width="65%" /></p>

<p>Finally take a look at Slack, by doing a quick Google search for Slack Bots:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bots/bots-slack-search.png" align="center" width="65%" /></p>

<p>It is pretty clear who owns the conversation when it comes to bots on their platform. While Twitter and Facebook both have information and guidance about doing bots they do not own the conversation like Slack does. Something that is reflected in the search engine placement. It is also something that sets the tone of the conversation that is going on within the community, and defines the types of bots that will emerge on the platform.</p>

<p>As I’ve said before, if you have a web or mobile property online today, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/07/11/either-you-own-the-conversation-around-your-apis-or-someone-else-will/">you need to be owning the conversation around your API or someone eventually will own it for you</a>. The same comes to automation around your platform, and the introduction of bots, and automated users, traffic, advertising, and other aspects of doing business online today. Honestly, I wouldn’t want to be in the business of running a platform these days. It is why I work so hard to dominate and own my own presence, just so that I can beat back what is said about me, and own the conversation on at least Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Github.</p>

<p>Seems like to me, if you are going to enable automation on your platform via APIs, it should be something that you own completely, and make sure you provide some pretty strong guidance and direction.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/08/15/elastic-search-security-apis/">The ElasticSearch Security APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api.html"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/elastic-search/elasticsearch-security-apis.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I was looking <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api.html">at the set of security APIs over at Elasticsearch</a> as I was diving into my API security research recently. I thought the areas they provide security APIs for the search platform was worth noting and including in not just my API security research, but also <a href="http://search.apievangelist.com">search</a>, deployment, and probably overlap with <a href="http://authentication.apievangelist.com">my authentication research</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Authenticate API</strong> - The Authenticate API enables you to submit a request with a basic auth header to authenticate a user and retrieve information about the authenticated user.</li>
  <li><strong>Clear Cache API</strong> - The Clear Cache API evicts users from the user cache. You can completely clear the cache or evict specific users.</li>
  <li><strong>User Management APIs</strong> - The user API enables you to create, read, update, and delete users from the native realm. These users are commonly referred to as native users.</li>
  <li><strong>Role Management APIs</strong> - The Roles API enables you to add, remove, and retrieve roles in the native realm. To use this API, you must have at least the manage_security cluster privilege.</li>
  <li><strong>Role Mapping APIs</strong> - The Role Mapping API enables you to add, remove, and retrieve role-mappings. To use this API, you must have at least the manage_security cluster privilege.</li>
  <li><strong>Privilege APIs</strong> - The has_privileges API allows you to determine whether the logged in user has a specified list of privileges.</li>
  <li><strong>Token Management APIs</strong> - The token API enables you to create and invalidate bearer tokens for access without requiring basic authentication. The get token API takes the same parameters as a typical OAuth 2.0 token API except for the use of a JSON request body.</li>
</ul>

<p>Come to think of it, I’ll add this to my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management research</a> as well. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/adding-four-new-building-building-blocks-providing-an-api-management-api-blueprint/">Much of this overlaps with what should be a common set of API management services as well</a>. Like much of my research, there are many different dimensions to my API security research. I’m looking to see how API providers are securing their APIs, as well as how service providers are selling security services to APIs providers. I’m also keen on aggregating common API design patterns for security APIs, and quantity how they overlap with other stops along the API lifecycle.</p>

<p>While the cache API is pretty closely aligned with delivering a search API, I think all of these APIs provide a potential building block to think about when you are deploying any API, and represents the Venn diagram that is API authentication, management, and security. I’m going through the rest of the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch</a> platform looking for interesting approaches to ensuring their search solutions are secure. I don’t feel like there are any search specific characteristics of API security that I will need to include in my final API security industry guide, but Elasticsearch’s approach has re-enforced some of the existing security building blocks I already had on my list.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/progrium/web-hooks-and-the-programmable-world-of-tomorrow-presentation/21-REST_Hooksrest_and_web_hooks"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/webhooks/RESTHooks.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I am getting to work on a base set of webhook specification for <a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">my human services data API work</a>, and I wanted to take a fresh drive through a handful of the leading APIs I’m tracking on. I’m needing to make some recommendations regarding how human services data APIs should be pushing information via APIs, as we as providing APIs. Webhooks are fascinating to me because they really are just APIs in reverse. Webhooks are just an API request, where the target URL is a variable, allowing an API call to be made from a platform, to any target URL, on an triggering events, or on a schedule as a job.</p>

<p>Here are six of the API providers I took a look at while doing this webhook research:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developer.box.com/v2.0/docs/getting-started-with-webhooks-v2"><strong>Box</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="[https://gumroad.com/webhooks"><strong>Gumroad</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.venmo.com/docs/webhooks"><strong>Venmo</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/"><strong>Github</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks"><strong>Stripe</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks"><strong>Slack</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>All of these API providers offer webhooks, allowing developers to create an API call that will be fired off when a specific event occurs. These events are usually tied to a specific object. Box is documents. Github is a repository. Stripe is a payment. With human services it will be an organization, location, or service. There are a handful of key concepts at play when it comes to webhooks, making them an important part of the equation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Object</strong> - The object in which an event is occurring. For this project it is organizations, locations, services, contacts, and potentially other elements of API operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Events</strong>  - This is a list of events that can occur against all the objects that will trigger the execution of a webhook.</li>
  <li><strong>Target</strong> - The URL of the webhook. This is the variable of the outgoing API call, allowing them to be defined by API consumers, nd executed by the API provider.</li>
  <li><strong>Fat</strong> - The webhook will carry a payload, submitting a predefined schema, usually of the associated object to the target.</li>
  <li><strong>Ping</strong> - The webhook does not carry a payload, simply pinging the target of a webhook, letting API consumers know an even has occurred.</li>
  <li><strong>Status</strong> - The ability to identify the status of a webhook.</li>
  <li><strong>Errors</strong> - The errors that should be returned as part of webhook execution, and shared as it’s status.</li>
  <li><strong>Retries</strong> - Allowing for webhook execution to be replayed, executing a specific event that occurred in the past.</li>
  <li><strong>Signatures</strong> - Allowing for the signature of each webhook request to be verified for security and integrity purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>Test</strong> - Enable API cnosumers to test a webhook and see if it will work, sending over real or sample data.</li>
  <li><strong>History</strong> - Providing a complete history of webhook execution for API consumers to search, browse, and review.</li>
</ul>

<p>The external focus, and their event based nature are the most notable characteristics of a webhook, but it is the transactional nature of their supporting systems that seem to make them such a utility that can help alleviate the load on APIs. There are a number of other characteristics of webhooks, but this gets at the core of what they do, and provide me with what I need to move my human services API conversations forward. I’m looking to have a handful of examples of webhook implementations for well-known API platforms to share with folks, and begin setting the stage for an initial API design and definition for a human services webhook implementation, based upon common practices already in use.</p>

<p>I find webhooks interesting because are not a standard, and there really aren’t much in the way of best practices. Just some common examples of how they are used by existing API providers. Webhooks are just APIs. It is just the target URL that is variable, and the objects and events that can be unique to each API platform. In human services implementations I don’t just see webhooks as being about making API calls to other applications. I see webhooks as something that can satisfy pushing of data between many different API implementations, beginning to set the stage for interoperability between hundreds or even thousands of human service providers, pushing and pulling data as needed, and prescribed by each API provider. Allowing human service providers to speak a common language and seamlessly share information across a variety of partnerships. Getting closer to Greg Bloom’s vision, the creator of <a href="http://openreferral.org">Open Referral</a>, and the person behind the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS), for how all of this should be working.</p>

<p>Part of the feedback I’ve received from <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">the Human Services Data API (HSDA) evolution from v1.0 to v1.1</a> was that the API didn’t allow for volume or bulk GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE. This was intentionally in the incremental release which focused on just making sure the API reflected 100% of the surface are for the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS). I wanted to separate out the needs of bulk API consumers, so that I could think about it separately from the more simple, micro-use integrations the default Human Services Data API would accommodate. I don’t want the industrial grade needs of database and system administrators overriding the simple access needs of other individual API consumers.</p>

<p>To kick off my human services bulk API definition I wanted to spend some time looking at other bulk implementations from a handful of leading providers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developers.intercom.com/v2.0/page/bulk-api-overview">Intercom</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html">ElasticSearch</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/page/File:Bulk_overview.png">SalesForce</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.diffbot.com/dev/docs/bulk/">Diffbot</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As I went through these implementations, and searched through Stack Overflow about bulk HTTP POSTs, I really didn’t see much difference on the technical front. Bulk APIs are primarily about acknowledging heavy duty data consumption, and primarily used HTTP POST for allowing the submission of either a) large individual POST, or b) large number of POST. Technically there isn’t much to them, where you start finding the nuance of bulk APIs over regular APIs is in the process surrounding the API implementation, things like having tasks, jobs, history, notifications, webhooks, email, and logging. Meaning there is just a lot more process and expectation around these APIs, which also most likely translates into more robust background architecture, and rules regarding the process involved with access.</p>

<p>Bulk APIs seem more about a separation of concerns. Bulk GET and POSTs require more infrastructure, and to do it properly you need process, and checks and balances to make sure a bulk operation is successfully executed, and there is sufficient history, notifications, and other events around bulk transactions. I’d say that bulk API operations should always be approached as a separate concern from the more mainstream web, mobile, single page application, embeddable, and spreadsheet applications. Providing a separate API subdomain, or paths allowing for the separation of infrastructure concerns, to make sure the API meets the availability concerns of both API provider and consumer. Next, I’ll spend some more time mapping out the task or job oriented structure of bulk APIs, but also for other API operations, to help make sure I do not reinvent the wheel when it comes to the design of my bulk API operations.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/algo-microservices.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p><a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">The Human Services Data API I have been working on is about defining a set of API paths for working with organizations, locations, and services that are delivering human services in cities around the world</a>. As I’m working to evolve the OpenAPI for the Human Services Data API (HSDA), I’m constantly mindful of bloat, unnecessary expansion of features, and always working to separate things by concern. My thoughts have evolved this due to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/11/a-hack-day-event-to-help-the-link-sf-app-speak-human-services-data-specification/">a hackathon I attended this week in San Francisco where a team at Optmizely worked to decouple an existing human services application from its backend and help teach it to speak Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a>–allowing it to speak a common language around the services that us humans depend on daily.</p>

<p>As the hackathon team was decoupling the single page application (React) from the API backend (Firebase) I took the API calls behind and published to Github as two JSON files. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/optimizely/linksf/master/core/sf_location.json">One of the files was locations, which contained 217 human service locations in San Francisco</a>, and metadata, which contained a handful of categories being used to organize and display the locations. In this situation, there is no notion of an organization, just 217 locations, offering human services across five categories. This legacy application, and forward engineering hackathon project was quickly becoming a microservices project, ironically it is a microservice project that was about delivering human services. ;-)</p>

<p>Looking at this unfolding project through a microservices lens, I needed to provide a single service. In the context <a href="https://link-sf.com/">of Link-SF</a>, the original project, I needed to offer a service that would deliver 217 locations where people can find human services in the areas of food, housing, hygiene, medical, and technology via an web, or mobile application. To help me achieve my goals I began to step through each of the steps of the lifecycle of any self-contained microservices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Github - Each of my services begins with a Github repository, <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/human-services-link/">so I created a new repo</a>.</li>
  <li>Definitions - I defined the service I wanted as <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/human-services-link/blob/master/_data/api-commons/openapi.yaml">an OpenAPI</a>.</li>
  <li>Design - I worked to keep the design of it as simple as I possibly can.</li>
  <li>DNS - I relied on Github’s DNS for this service, but may setup my own subdomain.</li>
  <li>Database - I published a YAML data file into the data folder for the Github repository, acting as the database for my service, leverage Github and Jekyll for helping me broker database connectivity.</li>
  <li>Deployment - I deployed <a href="https://adopta-agency.github.io/human-services-link/apis/locations.json">a simple static JSON API</a> driven from the locations YAML store.</li>
  <li>Management - I am using Github as the management platform for my API, helping me deploy and manage consumption of my service. I’m using the Github API as the programmatic layer for managing my service operations to help me continuously deploy and integrate with this service.</li>
  <li>Portal - I am using Github pages as the portal for my service, providing both human and programmatic access to my service, making human service locations more available.</li>
  <li>Documentation - I published static HTML, and Swagger UI documentation for the service.</li>
  <li>Support - I have published a support page, and will be providing support via Github issues, Twitter, and email.</li>
  <li>Communications - I have a blog published, and will be publishing the story of the service using the Jekyll CMS blogging solution.</li>
  <li>Caching - The API, portal, and all aspects of the service I’ve launched is being cached by Github, riding on the backs of their Content Delivery Network (CDN).</li>
  <li>Reliability - While Github has been known to have stability issues, it is still some of the most reliable way to host data and API driven services.</li>
  <li>Encryption - I’m leveraging the Github DNS, and using their encryption in transit by default. I will be using my own subdomain and encryption in the future.</li>
  <li>Security - I’m offloading platform security to Github. They have more resources than I do. I’m also looking to keep things more secure be keeping my services as static as possible.</li>
  <li>Testing - I am setting up a series of monitors to ensure the service stays available, and delivering expected data and promised schema. I will be publishing a status update and history page.</li>
  <li>Transparency - Everything involved with my service runs on Github, either as a public or private repository, with the entire lifecycle transparent publicly, or privately to whoever is given access to the repository using Github.</li>
  <li>Observability - The entire service runs on Github. The entire lifecycle is observable in the Github history, and leverage their existing infrastructure for identity and access management (IAM), and continuous integration and deployment.</li>
  <li>Discovery - There is an APIs.json available in the root of the project, providing a machine readable index of the schema, data, API, and other resources available via this service.</li>
  <li>Client - I’ve published an HTML / JavaScript client on the home page of the project, with an editor for managing the data, which leverages the Github API for reading and writing data to the services repository.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m calling my new service, born out of the Link-SF legacy application <a href="https://adopta-agency.github.io/human-services-link/">Human Services Link</a>. However, the only thing remaining of the Link-SF application is the data. I’ve forward engineered the schema, API, and web interface to all run on Github as a single, yet decoupled service. It is a reduction of the overall Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) schema, focusing in on just providing services at a handful of locations, reducing complexity and scope, to deliver a specific service–do one thing and do it well. I will be launching an Amazon EC2, and containerized version of this human services microservice, but I wanted to look at this one incarnation of it though the microservices lens. Sure, its not your classic microservices definition, but I think it holds up to a microservices test, it just makes some different architectural choices than the rest of the community might have made.</p>

<p>My human services microservice definition solves a single problem, for a specific type of end-user. It was originally geographically limited to San Francisco, but with with this evolution I’ve made sure there is a state/province field, as well as country, so that solution can be deployed for any city. I want the compute, database, DNS, API, portal, docs, and UI elements and admin tools to all be self contained for the delivery of a single microservice, but I wanted it all forkable, so you could launch this service over and over, in any city around the globe. There is still a lot of work to be done on this project before it is ready for prime time, but I’ve planted the seeds when it comes to delivering microservices in my world this way. I’m hoping it will be something I can’t ignore, and will keep pushing forward as part of my overall vision of how we can deliver sustainable API driven services.</p>

<p>I really like the static nature of this approach. I really like the forkability of this approach, and how you can use Github to separate out concerns by organization. I really like how I can offload much of the operation of my backend to Github, including security, CDN, and scalability / reliability. It is definitely not a pattern everyone should be following when doing microservices, but it does provide a static forkable pattern that can really help keep services very focused and self contained, but available to work in service of a bigger architectural picture. I’ll keep playing around with this approach to delivering human service microservices, and see what I can push forward and make stick. I’m hoping it can providing a low coast way for cash strapped municipalities to better deliver up to date information about human services to their entire population.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/containership_dali_three.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/08/14/some-microservice-thoughts-around-my-human-services-api-work/">I’ve been looking at my human services API work through a microservices lens, triggered by the deployment of a reduced functionality version of the human services implementation I was working on this week</a>. I’m thinking a lot about the technical side of decoupling services using APIs, but I want to also take a moment and think about the business side of decomposing services, while also making sure they are deployed in a way that meets both the provider and consumer side of the business equation. My human services microservice implementation is in the public service, which is a space where the business conversation often seems to disappear behind closed doors, but in reality needs to be front and center with each investment (commit) made into any service.</p>

<p>Let’s take a moment to look at the monetization strategy and operational plan for my human service microservice. Yes, a public data microservice should have a monetization strategy and plan for operating and remaining sustainable. The goals for this type of microservice will be radically different than it would be for a commercial microservice, but it should have one all the same.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monetization - How am I evaluating the investment into this project alongside any value that is generated, which I can potentially capture or exchange some value for some money to keep going.
    <ul>
      <li>Acquisition - What did it take for me to acquire the data and skills necessary to make the deployment possible.</li>
      <li>Development - What time was invested in setting up the platform, developing the schema, data, definitions, code, and visual elements.</li>
      <li>Operations - What does it take to operate the service? Maintain it, answer questions, provide support, and other realities of providing an online service today.</li>
      <li>Direct Value - What are the direct benefits of having this service available to people looking for human services, or organizations looking to provide human services.</li>
      <li>Indirect Value - What are the indirect benefits of having this service available, like increased conversation around human services, or maybe traffic and awareness of the Open Referral organization.</li>
      <li>Partners - What partnership opportunities are actively being sought out, or will be opened up by having this service available.</li>
      <li>Reporting - What type of reporting is necessary to operate and monetize this service, from tracking page views to understanding who is integrated with the data, and consuming data via APIs, or possibly through continuous integration of the Github repository.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Plan - What is my plan for making this service available to the public, partners, or maybe internally use across my own projects.
    <ul>
      <li>Elements - My human services location API is designed to be publicly available, forkable, and reusable by anyone.</li>
      <li>Limits - There are no limits on how each human services microservice can be used, or forked and reused. Ideally, any implementation provides attribution, and acknowledges the source of framework or data, but there really are no rules.</li>
      <li>Metrics - I am measuring unique page views on each page, including of the machine readable YAML, JSON, and other formats. I’m also tracking on stars, forks, and commits for each service.</li>
      <li>Commercial - Providing a clear track for commercial vendors to understand that the project needs their support, and can be improved upon, and evolved through their underwriting and support.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I need to have a coherent snapshot of what I’ve invested into each of my service. I need to have a base plan for how I will be executing the business side of this service–even if it just making something available for free. There are two dimensions to this conversation: 1) My view as the creator of this service 2) The view of folks who fork and implement as a service. Both dimensions should have a monetization snapshot, and a plan for executing within this business snapshot. I need all of this decoupled from any other service I am offering, but ideally they all use a common set of reusable patterns, just like the technical aspects of my microservices effort.</p>

<p>Just like needing the compute, database, DNS, and other technical layers to be stable and scalable across my microservices, I need the costs associated with these elements predictable and affordable. I need to know what it costs to define, design, deploy, manage, and deprecate my services. I need to know the best path forward for making them public, keeping them private, and being honest with commercial partners about the value that is being generated, both directly and indirectly. I need a way to report my costs, and revenue across hundreds or thousands of these services. I need to be able to scale this both horizontally across many services, but also vertically for single services which get deployed over and over, reused and continuously integrate wherever they are needed using Github.</p>

<p>I’ll keep applying this model across my human services project. I’m thinking that I’m going to be developing a whole buffet of human service microservices that run a 100% on Github like this, but I am also playing around with other varietals that run on other popular cloud platforms as well. I’m not one to subscribe to any particular API dogma, I’m just looking to explore what is possible, and do all of it as cheaply as I possibly scan, growing the number of projects I’m able to tackle. Of course, none of this would be possible without my partners funding my work, and helping me connect the technical and business aspects of doing API Evangelist.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/aws-answers-icons.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>The discussion around whether or not you should be hosting your own questions and answers (QA) and frequently asked questions (FAQ) for your API has continued, with many of the leading API pioneers asserting responsibility over the operations of these important API resources. Amazon noticed that answers about their platform on Quora and Stack Exchange were usually out of date and often just plain wrong, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/">prompting them to launch their own QA solution</a>.</p>

<p>I have written about using API providers using Stack Overflow for may years now. It the last few years I’ve had my readers push back on this for a variety of reasons, from the Stack Overflow community being primarily a white male bro-fest, to finding things being unreliable, out of date, and often a pretty hostile and unfriendly place for people to try and learn about APIs. I’d say that I still use Stack Overflow for about 40% of my querying of API and programming related subjects, but since I’m a white male who has been doing software for 30 years, I’m a little more resistant to the bro-fest. But, I get it, and hear what  folks are saying, and get it is not always a suitable environment.</p>

<p>Going back and forth on this subject, I’m back in the camp where API providers should be investing in operating their own QA, FAQ, and support forums. It’s definitely requires a significant amount of investment, policing, and sometimes taking stances that are unpopular, but if you are in this for the long game, it will be worth it. After watching AWS for a decade, you can see how incorrect information about your API operations can really begin to become a liability, and you might want to keep a tighter grip on where your API consumers go look for their answers. An added bonus is that you also get to set the tone for the types of questions that get answered, and the inclusiveness that will exist across your FAQ, QA, and Support.</p>

<p>I really need to get my core API design guides like <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">definitions</a>, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">deployment</a>, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">management</a> out the door, because I need to diving into areas like support, and gather all my thoughts regarding how API providers should be approaching this critical layer of operations. I feel like support is one of the most defining characteristics of sustainable API providers, right up there with communications I’d say. I don’t care how good your API is technically, if you don’t have a solid approach to supporting and communicating with your API community, I’m guessing you won’t be around very long, or if you do survive, your platform will be something savvy API consumers steer clear of.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/photos/light-wheel.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I was on a call the other day with a group of people who are in the trenches of organizations and companies working hard to deliver human services in cities around the country. We were meeting to kick of the design phase of a new type of API, and after they shared all their thoughts via project documentation, they were asking me to help identify examples of best practices from the space. The group felt they didn’t have the time, or the awareness of what is going on to be able to identify the best practices that already exist across the space.</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons I stay out of the weeds of individual projects. I may help define, design, and even shadow the deployment and management, but I work hard to avoid the tractor beam of ongoing projects so that I can pay attention to the bigger picture and help share stories about what I’m seeing. I feel like there should be people like me in each industry helping shine a light on, and aggregating of best practices when it comes to the API life cycle. There is just too much work to be done, and it helps to have folks who have domain expertise, not just lightly understanding what is going on across many sectors like I do.</p>

<p>I think it is fine for the sector to depend on API analysts like me, but I think that groups should also be investing in the time to pick up their heads up and pay attention to what else is going on when it comes to APIs in their industry. I understand that many groups are busy keeping systems operational, and dealing with real world problems, but dedicated reading of blogs, white papers, and tuning into social channels for other API providers is important as well. Each decision made on API design, deployment, and management should be established from time spent reading, and learning about other existing approaches–minimizing the amount of wheel reinvention that occurs.</p>

<p>The amount of time you invest in learning about other successful API providers will pay off in the amount of time it saves you when defining, designing, deploying, and managing an API. Sadly, it is one of those areas that some companies aren’t always equipped to measure the return on investment from something like this, resulting in many companies limiting the amount of time API developers spend reading blogs, and actively researching existing implementations, leading design patterns, and healthy API practices. If your boss is ever giving you grief about the amount of time you are spending on learning about other APIs, make sure and point them in my direction. I’m happy to help them understand why you don’t want to be reinventing the wheel when it comes to web APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-service-link-rel-03"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/erik-wilde/link-relation-types-for-web-services.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I have been reading through a number of specifications lately, trying to get more up to speed on what standards are available for me to choose from when designing APIs. Next up on my list is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-service-link-rel-03">Link Relation Types for Web Services</a>, by Erik Wilde. I wanted to take this informational specification and repost here on my site, partially because I find it easier to read, and the process of breaking things down and publishing as a posts helps me digest the specification and absorb more of what it contains.</p>

<p>I’m particularly interested in this one, because Erik captures what I’ve had in my head for APIs.json property types, but haven’t been able to always articulate as well as Erik does, let alone published as an official specification. I think his argument captures the challenge we face with mapping out the structure we have, and how we can balance the web with the API, making sure as much of it becomes machine readable as possible. I’ve grabbed the meat of Link Relation Types for Web Services and pasted here, so I can break down, and reference across my storytelling.</p>

<hr />

<ol>
  <li>Introduction<br />
One of the defining aspects of the Web is that it is possible to interact with Web resources without any prior knowledge of the specifics of the resource.  Following Web Architecture by using URIs, HTTP, and media types, the Web’s uniform interface allows interactions with resources without the more complex binding procedures of other approaches.</li>
</ol>

<p>Many resources on the Web are provided as part of a set of resources that are referred to as a “Web Service” or a “Web API”.  In many cases, these services or APIs are defined and managed as a whole, and it may be desirable for clients to be able to discover this service information.</p>

<p>Service information can be broadly separated into two categories: One category is primarily targeted for human users and often uses generic representations for human readable documents, such as HTML or PDF. The other category is structured information that follows some more formalized description model, and is primarily intended for consumption by machines, for example for tools and code libraries.</p>

<p>In the context of this memo, the human-oriented variant is referred to as “documentation”, and the machine-oriented variant is referred to as “description”.</p>

<p>These two categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as there are representations that have been proposed that are intended for both human consumption, and for interpretation by machine clients. In addition, a typical pattern for service documentation/description is that there is human-oriented high-level documentation that is intended to put a service in context and explain the general model, which is complemented by a machine-level description that is intended as a detailed technical description of the service.  These two resources could be interlinked, but since they are intended for different audiences, it can make sense to provide entry points for both of them.</p>

<p>This memo places no constraints on the specific representations used for either of those two categories.  It simply allows providers of aWeb service to make the documentation and/or the description of their services discoverable, and defines two link relations that serve that purpose.</p>

<p>In addition, this memo defines a link relation that allows providers of a Web service to link to a resource that represents status information about the service.  This information often represents operational information that allows service consumers to retrieve information about “service health” and related issues.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Terminology<br />
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,”SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Web Services<br />
“Web Services” or “Web APIs” (sometimes also referred to as “HTTP API” or “REST API”) are a way to expose information and services on the Web. Following the principles of Web architecture[ they expose URI-identified resources, which are then accessed and transferred using a specific representation.  Many services use representations that contain links, and often these links are typed links.</p>
  </li>

<p>Using typed links, resources can identify relationship types to other resources.  RFC 5988 [RFC5988] establishes a framework of registered link relation types, which are identified by simple strings and registered in an IANA registry.  Any resource that supports typed links according to RFC 5988 can then use these identifiers to represent resource relationships on the Web without having to re-invent registered relation types.</p>

<p>In recent years, Web services as well as their documentation and description languages have gained popularity, due to the general popularity of the Web as a platform for providing information and services.  However, the design of documentation and description languages varies with a number of factors, such as the general application domain, the preferred application data model, and the preferred approach for exposing services.</p>

<p>This specification allows service providers to use a unified way to link to service documentation and/or description.  This link should not make any assumptions about the provided type of documentation and/or description, so that service providers can choose the ones that best fit their services and needs.</p>

<p>3.1.  Documenting Web Services<br />
In the context of this specification, “documentation” refers to information that is primarily intended for human consumption.Typical representations for this kind of documentation are HTML andPDF.</p>

<p>Documentation is often structured, but the exact kind of structure depends on the structure of the service that is documented, as well as on the specific way in which the documentation authors choose to document it.</p>

<p>3.2.  Describing Web Services<br />
In the context of this specification, “description” refers to information that is primarily intended for machine consumption.Typical representations for this are dictated by the technology underlying the service itself, which means that in today’s technology landscape, description formats exist that are based on XML, JSON, RDF, and a variety of other structured data models.  Also, in each of those technologies, there may be a variety of languages that a redefined to achieve the same general purpose of describing a Web service.</p>

<p>Descriptions are always structured, but the structuring principles depend on the nature of the described service.  For example, one of the earlier service description approaches, the Web ServicesDescription Language (WSDL), uses “operations” as its core concept, which are essentially identical to function calls, because the underlying model is based on that of the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) model.  Other description languages for non-RPC approaches to services will use different structuring approaches.</p>

<p>3.3.  Unified Documentation/Description<br />
If service providers use an approach where there is no distinction of service documentation Section 3.1 and service descriptionSection 3.2, then they may not feel the need to use two separate links.  In such a case, an alternative approach is to use the”service” link relation type, which has no indication of whether it links to documentation or description, and thus may be better fit if no such differentiation is required.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Link Relations for Web Services<br />
In order to allow Web services to represent the relation of individual resources to service documentation or description, this specification introduces and registers two new link relation types.</li>
</ol>

<p>4.1.  The service-doc Link Relation Type<br />
The “service-doc” link relation type is used to represent the fact that a resource is part of a bigger set of resources that are documented at a specific URI.  The target resource is expected to provide documentation that is primarily intended for human consumption.</p>

<p>4.2.  The service-desc Link Relation Type<br />
The “service-desc” link relation type is used to represent the fact that a resource is part of a bigger set of resources that are described at a specific URI.  The target resource is expected to provide a service description that is primarily intended for machine consumption.  In many cases, it is provided in a representation that is consumed by tools, code libraries, or similar components.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Web Service Status Resources<br />
Web services providing access to a set of resources often are hosted and operated in an environment for which status information may be available.  This information may be as simple as confirming that a service is operational, or may provide additional information about different aspects of a service, and/or a history of status information, possibly listing incidents and their resolution.</li>
</ol>

<p>The “status” link relation type can be used to link to such a status resource, allowing service consumers to retrieve status information about a Web service’s status.  Such a link may not be available from all resources provided by a Web service, but from key resources such as a Web service’s home resource.</p>

<p>This memo does not restrict the representation of a status resource in any way.  It may be primarily focused on human or machine consumption, or a combination of both.  It may be a simple “traffic light” indicator for service health, or a more sophisticated representation conveying more detailed information such as service subsystems and/or a status history.</p>

<ol>
  <li>IANA Considerations<br />
The link relation types below have been registered by IANA perSection 6.2.1 of RFC 5988 [RFC5988]:</li>
</ol>

<p>6.1.  Link Relation Type: service-doc<br /></p>

<p>Relation Name: service-doc<br />
   Description: Linking to service documentation that is primarily   intended for human<br /> consumption.<br />
   Reference: [[ This document ]]<br /></p>

<p>6.2.  Link Relation Type: service-desc<br /></p>

<p>Relation Name: service-desc<br />
   Description: Linking to service description that is primarily   intended for consumption by machines.<br />
   Reference: [[ This document ]]<br /></p>

<p>6.3.  Link Relation Type: status<br /></p>

<p>Relation Name: status<br />
   Description: Linking to a resource that represents the status of a   Web service or API.<br />
   Reference: [[ This document ]]<br /></p>

<p><strong>Adding Some Of My Own Thoughts Beyond The Specification</strong>
This specification provides a more coherent service-doc, and service-desc that I think we did with humanURL, and support for multiple API definition formats (swagger, api blueprint, raml) as properties for any API. This specification provides a clear solution for human consumption, as well as one intended for consumption by machines. Another interesting link relation it provides is status, helping articulate the current state of an API.</p>

<p>It makes me happy to see this specification pushing forward and formalizing the conversation. I see the evolution of link relations for APIs as an important part of the API discovery and definition conversations in coming years. Processing this specification has <a href="https://github.com/apis-json/api-json/issues">helped jumpstart some conversation around APIs.json</a>, as well as other specifications like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/03/api-discovery-using-json-home/">JSON Home</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/03/microservice-discovery-using-pivio/">Pivio</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-service-link-rel-03">Thanks for letting me build on your work Erik!</a> - I am looking forward to contributing.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://api.data.gov/about/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-data-gov/9299911959_bdc195fb56_o.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I’m going to borrow, modify, and improve on the content from <a href="https://api.data.gov">api.data.gov</a>, because it is an important effort I want my readers to be aware of, because I want more of them to help apply educate other federal agencies regarding why it is a good idea to bake api.data.gov into their API operations, and help apply pressure until EVERY federal agency is up and running using a common API management layer.</p>

<p>Ok, so what is <a href="https://api.data.gov">api.data.gov</a>? api.data.gov is a free API management service for federal agencies. Our aim is to make it easier for you to release and manage your APIs. api.data.gov acts as a layer above your existing APIs. It transparently adds extra functionality to your APIs and helps deal with some of the repetitive parts of managing APIs.</p>

<p>Here are the features of api.data.gov:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You’re in control: You still have complete control of building and hosting your APIs however you like.</li>
  <li>No changes required: No changes are required to your API, but when it’s accessed through api.data.gov, we’ll transparently add features and handle the boring stuff.</li>
  <li>Focus on the APIs: You’re freed from worrying about things like API keys, rate limiting, and gathering usage stats, so you can focus on building the next great API.</li>
  <li>Make it easy for your users: By providing a standard entry point to participating APIs, it’s easier for developers to explore and use APIs across the federal government.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://api.data.gov">api.data.gov</a> handles the API keys for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>API key signup: It’s quick and easy for users to signup for an API key and start using it immediately.</li>
  <li>Shared across services: Users can reuse their API key across all participating api.data.gov APIs.</li>
  <li>No coding required: No code changes are required to your API. If your API is being hit through api.data.gov, you can simply assume it’s from a valid user.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://api.data.gov">api.data.gov</a> tracks all the traffic to your API and give you tools to easily analyze it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Demonstrate value: Understand how your API is being used so you can gauge the value and success of your APIs.</li>
  <li>Visualize usage and trends: View graphs of the overall usage trends for your APIs.</li>
  <li>Flexible querying: Drill down into the stats based on any criteria. Find out how much traffic individual users are generating, or answer more complex questions about aggregate usage.</li>
  <li>Monitor API performance: We gather metrics on the speed of your API, so you can keep an eye on how your API is performing.</li>
  <li>No coding required: No code changes are required to your API. If your API is being hit through api.data.gov, we can take care of logging the necessary details.
Documentation</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://api.data.gov">api.data.gov</a> helps with publishing documentation for your API:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hosted or linked: We can host the documentation of your API, or, if you already have your own developer portal, we can simply link to it.</li>
  <li>One stop shop: As more agencies add APIs to api.data.gov, users will be able to discover and explore more government APIs all at one destination.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://api.data.gov">api.data.gov</a> helps you rate limit because you might not want to allow all users to have uncontrolled access to your APIs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prevent abuse: Your API servers won’t see traffic from users exceeding their limits, preventing additional load on your servers.</li>
  <li>Per user limits: Individual users can be given higher or lower rate limits.</li>
  <li>No coding required: No code changes are required to your API. If your API is being hit, you can simply assume it’s from a user that hasn’t exceeded their rate limits.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://api.data.gov">api.data.gov</a> is powered by the open source project API Umbrella. You can contribute to the development of this platform, or setup your own instance and run the entire stack yourself. If you’re interested in exploring any of this for your APIs, <a href="https://api.data.gov/contact/#apidatagov-service-contact">please contact us</a>. In general, it’s easy to take any existing API your agency has (or is in the process of building) and put api.data.gov in front of it. This can be an easy way to get started and see what type of functionality api.data.gov might provide for your API.</p>

<p><a href="https://api.data.gov">api.data.gov</a> is all about consistent API management across federal government, which means developers will be able to get at government data, content, and algorithms more efficiently, and integrate them into web, mobile, and other applications. We need more government agencies to be doing this, taking advantage of api.data.gov and get to work developing an awareness around who is consuming their API resources. Eventually API management will be how government agencies will be generating revenue on top  of valuable API resources, charging commercial users enough so that each agency can cover the costs of operations, and hopefully make more of an investment in the resources they are making available.</p>
