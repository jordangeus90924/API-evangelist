			<p><em>15 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>I wrote about&nbsp;What Is An API First Strategy? Adding Some Dimensions To This New Question the other day after talking with 18F. One of the commonets on the post was&nbsp;from my friend Logan Powell (@logantpowell), and I think it was so good, that it deserves its own post. I will let Logan do the talking: To supplement the pool of meaning here, I would like to add that an API-first strategy is one where the API serves as both a pattern of an enterprises IT architecture as well as catalyst for engagement. In a nutshell, an API-first strategy is a systems paradigm shift -- from a centralized, engineered mechanical system made up of subordinate parts serving as means to deliberately designed ends -- to a decentralized, organic and evolving ecosystem where the individual actors can be spontaneously enfranchised or co-opted by any other actor / set of actors to serve new purposes. This allows the system to be more flexible, respond more quickly and behave more dynamically to suit unforeseen purposes. I believe the API-first paradigm is thereby more scalable by nature. Prudent separation of information from presentation through APIs should be the first and next step for most organizations with large IT infrastructures. To be more specific, this provides a number of efficiency benefits. To just name a few: by modulating infrastructure with solid APIs, stakeholders can create / hack together production-ready applications faster, more securely and more reliably. This approach warrants a new form of IT team protocol wherein the curation of APIs is front-and-center to their role. When designing a new product / service, the design of it's API should be commensurate. As the product or service makes it's way to production, making sure the API is well documented, easy to use / as conventional as possible, hooked up with analytics, secure and prepared to scale should be a given (these are frequently included in any self-respecting API management solution). In so...[<a href="/2014/08/15/what-is-an-api-first-strategy-it-architecture-and-catalyst-for-engagement/">Read More</a>]</p>

I&rsquo;m coordinating with the development team for Developer.Trade.Gov today, providing them with a review of their new developer area, and some suggestions on how to make their APIs, and developer more usable.
The Developer.Trade.Gov is published as a Github repository, using Jekyll and Github Pages to actually deliver the website. The feedback I&rsquo;ve been giving to the team, has been done through the Github issue management for the repository.
One piece of feedback I left was:

I love that when I land on your home page, I get a brief description of what developer.trade.gov delivers, the probem is that the description is below the fold on some monitors, leaving just the 3 links available to see.
I'd switch the description and links, putting description at the top....and the first thing your eyes are drawn to. You'd be surprised how valuable this can be. Simple, but important.

I submitted&nbsp;the suggestion 5 hours ago, and I just received an update that the issue was closed, and my suggestions were incorporated. When you go to the Developer.Trade.Gov website now, you will see the text, with links to the right&mdash;creating a much more clean, informative, and usable way to deliver the most valuable real estate you have in your developer hub. It was a small, but quick and meaningful change to a government website.
Imagine if we could help other agencies see the benefit of publishing small, simple websites, developer hubs, single page apps, and other projects to Github, and manage their feedback loops via Github issues. What types of improvements in delivering government services would we see? What cost savings could be realized across government?

			<p>I got a gentle ping today, as I often do when there is a new developer hub or API launched in the federal government. This time it was located within the Department of Commerce, for the International Trade Administration, and was a new developer area, with five APIs at Developer.Trade.Gov. I quickly went through the new developer area, which I consider passing the test for a minimum viable developer area, possessing all the essential building blocks an API developer hub needs. The only places I feel it fell short is in the feedback loop, and providing machine readable definitions for each of the five APIs. I submitted my feedback as Github issues, on the repository for the developer hub, but when it comes to machine readable definitions for each of the five APIs, I know how easy this is, so rather than just submit issues, I figured I'd get to work generating the machine readable API definitions for Developer.Trade.Gov, and demonstrate what was possible. As I do with all of my work, I setup a subdomain, and Github repository, to store all of my work, and got to work on each of the five APIs: Market Research Library (Swagger) ITA Offices &amp; Centers (Swagger) Trade Events Trade Leads Trade News &amp; Articles I chose to use Swagger for creating my machine readable API definitions, and while I was waiting for the Github commit to take for the Market Research Library API Swagger definition + Swagger UI, I got to work on the ITA Offices &amp; Centers API. As I was finishing up, I reloaded the interactive docs for the Market Research Library API, and got the dreaded CORS warning: Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://api.trade.gov/market_research_library/search?keyword=travel. This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS. That is where the fun ends for me.

I spoke with Phil Windley (@windley) over at Brigham Young University (BYU) about their API strategy this morning. BYU is bringing together API providers and consumers, to establish a coordinated strategy for delivering designing, deploying, managing, and integrating with APIs across campus--an effort being led by CIO Kelly Flannagan (@kelflanagan).
As part of their latest API effort, BYU is focusing in on the lowest hanging fruit when it comes to campus resources:

Students
Instructors
Classrooms
Classes
Courses

The API team is still struggling with a handful of technical details like how to deal with unique identifiers, and relationship between resources, but overall they are on a healthy path when it comes to getting their API designed, and deployed for use at the institution. I&rsquo;m interested in seeing how fast they progress with a top down approach to APIs, vs the bottom up efforts I&rsquo;m seeing at institutions like UC Berkeley.
I will be talking their team regularly, about their design, deployment, management, and integration strategy. I want to make sure and document the process all along the way, and share real-time updates that other universities can follow along, or possibly collaborate with us when it comes to establishing some common API patterns we can share and re-use across higher educational institutions.
Look for any stories out of BYU, here on API Evangelist, or over at my university API research site, and if you are doing any API work at your school, I'd love to know more about it.

			<p>I haven&rsquo;t written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, and bring them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist. I just wrote a piece on replacing legacy systems at the VA using APIs, where one of the systemic constraints in place that restricts the modernizzation VA systems using API is purely about money, and more specifically the color of money. I won&rsquo;t bore you with the detail of the topic, but in short the color of money is: Money appropriated for one purpose cannot be used for a different purpose, according to the Purpose Act (31 U.S.C. &sect; 1301). In short, if $50M was given to sustain an existing legacy system, and that money cannot be re-appropriated, and applied to the newer system, what incentive is there to ever get rid of legacy VA systems, or modernize any government system for that matter? Whether it is usng APIs, or anything else. Newer approaches to using technology are difficult to accept when you are working hard to accomplished your job each day, but if you already have $50M in budget to a specific job, and that job won&rsquo;t go away, unless you choose to make it go away, guess what happens? Nothing changes&hellip;hmmm? As I said before, I don&rsquo;t give a shit if you deploy APIs from the ground up, or excite via a presidential mandates from the top down, if you have incentives in place for employees to do the opposite, based upon how money is allocated, you won&rsquo;t be changing any behavior or culture&mdash;you are wasting your energy.

			<p>I haven't written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, and bring them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist. One of the jobs I was tasked with at the VA as a PIF, was taking inventory of the web services within the agency. When asking folks where these web services were, I was directed to various IT Leads on different groups, each giving one or two more locations I could look for word, excel, or other PDFs talking about web services used in projects and known systems. Most of the time these were redundant lists, pointing me to the same 5 web services, and omitting 20-30 that were actually in use for a project. At one point I was given the contact information for a lady who had been working for two years on a centralized web registry project, that would be the holy grail of web service discovery at the VA. This was it! It was what I was looking for, until I sat in on the weekly call where this project got a 10 minute update, demonstrating that the registry was still about defining the how and what of the registry, and never has actually moved to cataloging actual web services in the wild at the VA. ;-( Then one day I was introduced to a gentlemen, that was in a back office, in an unmarked cubicle, who seemed to know where most of the web services were, the one difference with this person was that they were a contractor, and not an employee.

			<p><em>13 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>One of the byproducts of the Oracle vs Google API copyright case, was a realization that many API providers and consumer do not understand the layers of the API stack, let alone the potential licensing considerations for each layer of the API onion. I wouldn't just blame API providers, and consumers, I&rsquo;m still getting a grasp on all of this, which is why I'm blogging about the subject. Let&rsquo;s take a quick crack at defining the layers to the potential API licensing onion: Data - What is the licensing for the actual data returned and collected by an API? I&rsquo;m still learning about the ways to license your data, and the Open Data Commons provides some guidance in this area, while others feel that your data can just as be easily licensed using Creative Commons licensing. Data Model - The separation between data and its data model can be hard to see, where in reality end-users may own their data, but the order and structure of it can be owned by the originating application. If this layer is a concern, Creative Commons, or other copyright options should be considered. Server - Server side API code is the core of any API operations, and should be licensed accordingly using common open source software licenses&nbsp;when appropriate. However I would add that this is the one layer in the API stack where a proprietary licensing could make sense, but the rest of the stack should always be licensed as open as possible. Interface - The separation between the API and its surface area is important, and is something that is just becoming relevant with the Oracle v Google copyright case. Understanding the importance of an openly licensed surface area, is essential to the health of any API stack, and should be kep as open as possible, even when associated with a proprietary API backend. This is why we started API commons, to help API providers take a stance...[<a href="/2014/08/13/taking-a-look-at-the-api-licensing-stack/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I haven't written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, slowly bringing them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist. On deck are my thoughts on replacing legacy systems with APIs, at the Department of Veteran Affairs. In the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, one of the motivations for deploying APIs, is to assist in the evolution, and replacement of legacy systems. The theory is, you have older system that needs to be replaced, and you can wrap in a modern web API, and slowly switch any desktop, web, mobile or other client system to use the new API&mdash;then you build out newer backend system, and make the switch in the API layer from the legacy to the newer backend system, leaving everything operating as expected. API magic! I'm used to hostile environments to this way of thinking, but most times in the private sector there are other business objectives that can be leveraged to get legacy system owners to get on board with a shift towards API deployment&mdash;I saw no incentive for this practice in the VA environment, where in reality there are incentives for IT, and business owners, as well as 3rd party contractors to keep legacy systems in place, not replace them. There are a variety of motivation for existing VA workers to keep existing systems in place, ranging from not understanding how the system works, to budgetary restrictions on how money flows in support of this pro-sustainment culture. Here is an example. There is old database for storing of a specific type of document, a database that X amount of existing desktop, server, web, or even mobile systems depend on.

			<p>I haven't written much about my experience last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). I have lots of thoughts about experience at the VA, as well as participating in the PIF program, and I choose to trickle these thoughts out, as I continue to make sense of them, and bring them into alignment with my overall mission as the API Evangelist. I was given three projects when I started work at the VA: 1) Inventory data assets 2) Inventory web services 3) Move forward D2D, a forms web service that would allow VA hospitals and Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) to submit forms through the claims process on behalf of veteran. The most prevalent illness I witnessed across these three efforts was a unwillingness to trust outside groups (even VSOs and hospitals), and a lack of desire to share data and resources to anyone outside of the VA (ironically except contractors), to the point where groups seem to take defensive positions around what they did on behalf of our veterans. This culture makes for some pretty toxic environments, I personally feel contributing to much of the problems we&rsquo;ve seen bubble up into the public media space of late. While work at the VA you constantly hear about the VA claims backlog, and how we need to optimize, but when you bring up sharing data, or resources to other federal agencies, trusted external partners like hospitals, and VSO&rsquo;s you get pushback with concerns of security, personally identifiable information (PII), etc. All which are valid claims, but there are proven ways to mitigate these risks through Identify and Access Management (IAM), which is another whole post in itself. You start feeling crazy when you get pushback for arguing that a doctor should be able to submit disability questionnaires via an iPad application, that uses an existing VA API, in a way that securely authenticates the doctor.

			<p><em>13 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I get regular requests to add APIs to my website via email, Twitter, and carrier pigeon. I have an Evernote that I put these requests into, and as I have time, I review, then possibly add to the appropriate API Evangelist network project.
To support this process, I've crafted a new response email to requests I get, that I thought I would share with everyone:

Sure thing. It could take me a day or two, or maybe up to a week.
You are also welcome to fork any of the 60+ API Evangelist network projects, and add to the JSON list that is driving the listing, they are all under the /data folder. Otherwise I'll add as I have time in the next week.
Once you submit your pull request, if your company listing is relevant to the research I&rsquo;m doing, I will accept your addition. No guarantees, so make sure it will provide value to not just my research, but to the API community.
Thanks for sharing information about your API!

It is a little known fact that all 60+ plus of my research projects run as Github repositories, using Github and Jekyll to drive the overall website and blog. With this approach, everyone can fork any of my projects, add a company to a listing, post to the blog, or correct a spelling or grammar error.
Just remember, when you are looking to get the word out about your API, or new feature, you can help curate and publish on the API Evangelist network.

			<p>I was taking another look at the Google Cloud Platform yesterday, and stumbled across Google Cloud Endpoints. It was something I saw come across my feeds, but really didn&rsquo;t give it the time it needed to see what it was all about. With the new Google Cloud Endpoints, Google is making a strong push to be not just an API deployment provider, but their approach also reflects what I&rsquo;d consider to be an evolution of backend as a service (BaaS) deployment. I think Google describes their service better than I can do it justice: Google Cloud Endpoints consists of tools, libraries and capabilities that allow you to generate APIs and client libraries from an App Engine application, referred to as an API backend, to simplify client access to data from other applications. Endpoints makes it easier to create a web backend for web clients and mobile clients such as Android or Apple's iOS. While much of the Google Cloud Platform offering looks a lot like the cloud offering over at Amazon Web Services, AWS definitely does not have API deployment as a service, baked into their cloud stack, like Google does with Google Cloud Endpoints. Google puts an emphasis on API endpoint deployment for mobile purposes, but leaves it open to be used in JavaScript as well&mdash;which seems a little limiting, since you could call same endpoints in any language. Oh well, I&rsquo;m not writing their marketing. ..the API backend is an App Engine app that performs business logic and other functions for Android and iOS clients, as well as JavaScript web clients. The functionality of the backend is made available to clients through Endpoints, which exposes an API that clients can call. Google provides SDKs for Android, iOS, and JavaScript, as well as a very Java heavy development process using Maven, combined with the Google Plugin for Eclipse, which&nbsp;is used to design, develop, and deploy your APIs to Google App Engine.

			<p><em>11 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>I hear this phrase used more and more lately, &ldquo;An API First Strategy&rdquo;. It is something you hear from startups like printing API LOB, to established players like Pearson, all the way up to 18F at the GSA in Washington DC, but what is API first? Much like APIs in general, an API first strategy is something that will mean something different to each company, organization, government agency, or individual. From my view, the most common interpretation of API first will be: Develop an API First - Before you build your website, web, mobile or single page application you develop an API first, then you get to work on defining the channels you will be making the API resources available on. I had an interesting conversation today with the 18F team in Washington DC, and they illuminated some other possible dimensions to the API first conversation for me, that I wanted to explore a little: Design Your API First - Using tools like Apiary, and API definition formats like API Blueprint, you kick off discussion with customers, generate user stories, and mockup your API, and even your web or mobile app interfaces, using your mock API. API First In Open Source Software - Encouraging the development and use of open source software solutions similar to Wordpress, that have API by default, so when agencies deploy them, they always have an API as part of their first steps for making access and integration decision&mdash;something that can drastically shift what is possible. My goal is to help small business, non-profit organizations, and government of all shapes and sizes understand the benefits of an API first strategy, so having conversation with API leaders like 18F, and getting their view on what API first means is essential to my storytelling process. How do you view API first at your company? How has your development lifecycle evolved since embracing APIs?

			<p>I published the story last night on finalizing the most recent version of the API discovery format APIs.json, and the support for it in the open source API search engine APIs.io. Steve and I are done messing with the format for a while, and want to encourage API providers to begin describing their APIs using the open format. After publishing the story last night, I also had an interesting comment on Google+ from Jonas Hellstr&ouml;m: The question got me thinking about how APIs.json rolled out. As with API Commons, APIs.json started as a conversation between Steve Willmott (@njyx) and I. Around the beginning of April we combined our notes on what each of us envisioned when it came to API discovery, establishing the first APIs.json definition with the timeline going roughly like this: April 2014&nbsp; Steve and I established version .11 of APIs.json We emailed a handful of smart folks that we trusted for feedback Crafted version .12 of APIs.json Developed APIs.io May 2014 We launched API.json at Gluecon in Broomfield, CO Encouraged discussion via the APIs.json Google Group Encouraged feedback via the Github issue management on APIs.json repo Cotinued email Conversations Established a Twitter presence for @apisjson Presented as part of session at API Days in Barcelona, Spain June 2014 Establish version 0.13 of APIs.json Continued discussion on Google Group Continued feedback on Github issue management Continued email conversations&nbsp; July 2014 Conducted a session on API discovery, including APIs.json at APICraft in Detroit Tony Tam (@fehguy) for the work on the JSON schema (thank you Tony!) Established version 0.14 of APIs.json August 2014 Updated APIs.json for API Evangelist network to version 0.14 Updated APIs.io to support version 0.14 of APIs.json It has been an interesting five months.

			<p><em>11 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>I just talked with Dave Devitt (@sydcon), President at SYDCON Web Development, Inc. in Chicago about how his web and mobile development shop sees the world APIs. I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for stories about how the everyday person on the ground at startups, all the way up to the federal government, actually see the world of APIs, and I was pleased that Dave could make some time to share his view of APIs with me. First, Dave said something I found very interesting when we first started our conversation. He said they were a &ldquo;web development shop&rdquo;, not in the the sense that they build websites, but that they develop applications that use the web for their operations. I think this is an important distinction when we start putting developers into buckets, and it isn&rsquo;t always as straightforward as building websites, web applications, mobile, single page or Internet of Things apps&mdash;we are now building software that uses the Internet for communication, something that will inevitably use all of these channels (and more). When it comes to API usage at SYDCON, they primarily use what we all call public APIs for driving commerce. Whether it is B2B or B2C, Dave&rsquo;s team is using APIs to sell products, integrate with payment systems like Authorize.net and PayPal, activating and validating of gift cards. Whether it is the nature of development or just a reflection on the type of customers SYDCON has, commerce is a pretty clear motivator for public API integration. The modern web API movement was started by commerce platforms like Amazon, eBay, and Paypal, and 14 years in it makes sense that commerce is a major driver of development at smaller develop shops. Beyond commerce, the main usage of APIs at SYDCON is about opening up access to internal resources that exist within their client systems, and making them available to buid apps on top of.

I was browsing through Google&rsquo;s Cloud Platform, in the 15 minute lead up to a preliminary discussion with Google about being an evangelist for the platform (another story), and I saw a useful pattern from the "customers" section for publishing API customer case studies--something I wanted to share with you.
This pattern was evident in the Travel Agency Masters Big Data with Google BigQuery case study. I think the format for the case study provides a simple format that other API providers might consider following:

A catchy summary title&nbsp;
Challenge the company faced&nbsp;
Solution to the problem&nbsp;
A quote from company&nbsp;
Results from the solution


Additionally, Google provides an "At a Glance" summary in the left hand bar, for those busy folks who don't have the time to read case studies, providing a quick summary of the case study:

What they wanted to do&nbsp;
What they did&nbsp;
What they accomplished&nbsp;
About API service used

The outline for the case study, as well as the summary version is a nice, simple format that any API provider could use to when crafting their own API case study experience. The format allows for easy scanning by visitors, which allows for us busy folks to read, or quickly scan multiple case studies--giving more context to the potential value an API will deliver.

			<p>Steve (@njyx), Nicolas (@picsoung), and I have been working hard to gather all the feedback from some very smart folks on the API.json format. Now we are stoked to finally announce that we have the 0.14 version ready for prime time. Our goal with the first version of APIs.json, was to just get the idea out there to get feedback from the community, and after four iterations, we feel like the format is now something the community can really build on. First, lets recap, what is APIs.json? APIs.json is a machine readable JSON file that lives in the root of your domain, and describes your APIs and its supporting API program. Think of APIs.json as a robots.txt, or sitemap.xml from Google, but instead of describing all the pages of your website, an APIs.json describes your developer portal, all available APIs, and the supporting building blocks of your API program--allowing you to describe your API efforts whether it is a public, or private affair. The goal is simply to provide a machine readable description, that any search engine can crawl, and make sense of your overall API program, and each individual API resource. The real power of APIs.json lies in the properties that you can apply to your APIs. We wanted to start with providing basic links meant for humans, like a link to the API signup page, or documentation, but then quickly provide machine readable elements like a Swagger specification, or API Commons manifest. However we don&rsquo;t want to define and control all of the properties you use to describe your APIs, and while we have a short list of additional properties that we are adding in on the next version, you can use any property you like just by adding x- to your own type label. Along with the APIs.json 0.14 release, the API search engine APIs.io also supports the latest APIs.json format. You can now validate your APIs.json 0.14, and submit your API.json...[<a href="/2014/08/10/next-stable-version-of-apis-json-apis-io-is-ready-are-your-apis-discoverable/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m seeing an increase in the number of API deployment services this year, such as startups like StrongLoop and API Spark. These companies are looking to help all of us deploy APIs from common systems, often without the need for IT or programming resources.
The providers I&rsquo;m seeing emerge are catering to some of the lowest hanging fruit for deploying APIs. The commonly used, and easiest to access systems, that contain the valuable content, data, and media we need to make accessible via APIs.
The common source for many of these API deploy solutions are:

Excel Spreadsheet&nbsp;with&nbsp;SheetLabs
Google Spreadsheet&nbsp;from&nbsp;API Spark
Database&nbsp;At The&nbsp;Dream Factory

These common information sources, represent the places where the average person in any size company, organization or government agency will be storing their valuable resources.  It makes sense that this new wave of API deployment startups would target these services.
If you consider every system integration option that classic API gateways have delivered, it provides a good reference for finding opportunities for building independent API deployment solutions, that if done right, could be a startup all by itself.
Not all companies can afford a full API gateway solution, and their needs are too small for a gateway. There is an emerging opportunity to help people quickly deploy APIs from common sources like spreadsheet, database, file stores, as well as more unique sources like specialty CMS and CRM systems.
Sometimes I like to look at the expanding API universe as a result of the SOA big bang, where all the tools that were in your SOA toolbox, being liberated, and available as independent services that you can get from an increasing number of new API deployment startups.

			<p>A blog is such a simple thing, but when it comes to the world of APIs, it can be one of the most important signals for whether or not an API is worthy of integration, or you should just move on and continue looking for another API to use. I know many folks will dismiss that a blog is so relevant, especially if they are coming from IT or developer disciplines--I respectfully decline. In reality, a blog not only provides a great way to keep API consumers up to date, it also provides the essential human face to any API operation. An API&rsquo;s blog provides a regular flow of information that show there is someone behind the curtain, who is not just working on the API, but actively is contributing ideas to the API community, and is there to support. A blog is the number one signal for me when evaluating the quality of an API. I track on whether an API has a blog, how of the blog is updated, and how long since the last post. Using these signals, it is pretty easy to tell when a public API is getting the resources it needs, and when the support for a public API is losing steam within a company. Here is an example of this in action&mdash;back in April I commented on the ESPN API: It is sad that the last ESPN "API-focused musings and ramblings" was 1 year ago ;-( http://t.co/sMWDoFtacJ &gt;&gt; I prefer them more often &mdash; Kin Lane (@kinlane) April 16, 2014 Sure enough, four short months later, ESPN announces they are shutting down their public APIs.

			<p><em>08 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve launched a new API news site, designed to provide short news updates from across the world of APIs. The API Report is the newest part of the API Evangelist network of sites, with apievangelist.com as the analysis on the business of APIs, apivoice.com as the analysis on the politics of APIs, and the the API Report as the industry news heartbeat. The API Report is built on Github, as a public repository, using Github Pages, and Jekyll. This approach to blogging opens up the news site to a new form of collaborative publishing, allowing anyone to fork, author their own API news story, and make a pull request for publishing to the site. Every commit will be reviewed for quality, and either rejected, or published to the live API Report website. Each post should follow a simple format, allowing for easy scanning of the days API news by consumers. The API Report has an RSS feed, as well as a Twitter account, for reader and social syndication. Soon, the API Report will also have its own advertising network, which will allow anyone to purchase any of the advertising slots available in the header, right hand sidebar, and in the body of all blog posts. Advertising will be priced very low at first, but as pageviews grow, and demand increases, and weekly market rate will be set--allowing for weekly turnover of advertising opportunities. If you are an API provider of any shape or size, or an API enthusiast, I recommend you help craft stories for the API Report, fork the site, and make a pull request, anytime you have a new piece you want share. Once the API Report advertising is up and running, and being monetized, I will be setting aside 50% of revenue and sharing with all contributors based upon pageviews.

			<p><em>08 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>ESPN just announced that they will no longer be accepting registrations for public API keys, and discontinuing all of their public APIs. I saw a few enraged comments on the Twitterz when I originally tweeted out the story, and also saw a couple of people compare it to the recent Netflix API deprecation. In reality I don't think the shuttering of the public ESPN API, or the Netflix API is a reflection on the viability of APIs, steering clear of the usual API FUD that APIs are forever, wait no&hellip;they can go away at any time! I think the decision to shutter the ESPN API is due to lack of vision, outreach, and the establishment of the vital developer feedback loops that are necessary to make APIs successful, but most importantly they failed to understand the challenges faced when deploying APIs in a tightly controlled industry. Doing public APIs in tightly controlled spaces like the movie and sports industry has to be tough. Both to these spaces have built their empires on tightly controlling the content, messaging, distribution, branding, and other elements&mdash;which are all things that work against the ethos of a successful public API strategy. In my mind it shows that APIs aren&rsquo;t really the thing we all claim they are, it is everything that comes bundled the API, and a company's willingness to evolve. I&rsquo;m sure we'll see waves of other companies, who come from legacy industries like movies, sports, publishing, television, and other similar sectors, try APIs, thinking they will be a technological silver bullet, in coming years who also neglect to pay attention to the business and politics of APIs that will provide essential building blocks that support the technology. There are plenty of lessons to be learned from both ESPN and Netflix, but two that stand out for me, is the importance of understanding the entire lifecycle of the resources you are making available, and the value of having a...[<a href="/2014/08/08/public-apis-are-tough-when-you-are-in-a-tightly-controlled-industry/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Swagger is now Open API Definition Format (OADF) -- READ MORE I went through 77 federal government API developer portals a couple of weeks ago, as part of some API discovery work I&rsquo;m doing with APIs.json. I ended up targeting 120 APIs that I will be generating of Swagger definitions, and API.json for their umbrella domain, or subdomain over the next couple months. As I made my way through each of these developer areas, I began to realize that I would have to sign up for API keys at each of these developer areas. I&rsquo;m sure some of the APIs will not require a key, but it is still potentially 77 separate API keys (I will let you know the final count when I know), that I will have to register for&mdash;the federal government needs a common, yet distributed API management strategy. To augment this common, yet distribution API management strategy, I would like to be able to just use Github oAuth to ping an API provider, request my application keys, and using the Github API to then store them in a repository of my choosing. I store all of my API keys for my applications, in a central location that my apps can securely put to use, and in many cases these apps are already using a private Github repository as a centralized configuration location. I shouldn't have to go through 77 separate API registration flows to get the API keys I need. I should be able to get API access in a programmatic way, using my existing Github account, and put Github oAuth to use in an authentication flow, getting the API keys I need in real time, in the location that I need them. This API access workflow would allow me to quickly gain access to resources I need for my apps, and store all my API keys in a single, or across multiple Github repositories&mdash;potentially giving me a simple, but powerful...[<a href="/2014/08/08/give-me-a-url-to-request-then-store-my-api-keys-in-my-private-github-repo/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Daniel Jacobson - Scaling the Netflix API I was learning more about the discovery of private APIs with the Charles App, and was fascinated by its potential to visualize, and map the darkest regions of the API realm. There is a lot of speculation about the number of APIs out there, with the 10K+ public APIs that are currently available being the &ldquo;tip of the iceberg&rdquo;, and the number of private APIs rpresenting the rest of the surface area below the dark surface--making the approach that Tim Rogers (and others) employ a tantalizing option for mapping these dark waters of the rapidly expanding API space. HTTP proxing and monitoring solutions like Charles are nothing new, and there are a wealth of next generation&nbsp;API integration tools like Runscope and APITools available, but what is interesting about this, is the routing all of your app traffic for your laptop, tablet or smartphone through a proxy, and record not just the traffic between you and the private APIs your apps depend on, but the mapping out the API interface, request, response, and underlying data models. Before I continue with this story, I have to admit this is a little on the dark side of APIs, and is something I don't recommend doing, because you are going to piss off a whole bunch of API providers&mdash;regardless, I think it is an interesting idea, that is worth sharing and discussing. What if someone packaged up an HTTP proxy, monitoring, and provided a recording layer for the interface, requests, responses, and data models, scrubbed out PII, and allowed individuals to opt in and publish the resulting definitions to a shared, public registry? Of course you would not publish your own transmissions, and underlying data, you would only publish the interface, requests, responses, and data models for the private APIs that are driving your public mobile and tablet applications. This centralized location would then aggregate, and shed light on this dark region,...[<a href="/2014/08/07/mapping-the-world-of-internal-apis-via-rogue-api-registry/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I began exploring the use a restaurant menu to help people understand API copyright, and how your API definition is not your secret sauce, and that there is so much more to your API that just the surface area.
I'm continuing my exploration of using restaurants as an analogy to help onboard people with not just API copyright, but introducing APIs to the masses--helping them understand the layers to the API space, in a way that is familiar.
To prepare for future stories and conversations I'm expanding on my API definition = Menu analogy with:

API Providers = Restaurant Owners
Developer Portal = Restaurant
APIs = Food &amp; Drink Items
API Definition + Docs = Menu
API Consumers (Apps) = Restaurant&nbsp; Customers (People)
Freemium - Samples Out Front
Partner Access = Catering
Terms of Service = We Reserve The Right To Refuse - No Substitutions
API Service Providers = Restaurant Equipment Providers

Obviously it is work in progress. I will need better stories and visuals to get the concept across. Then once I start working through the different types of restaurants (ie. American, Chinese, Mexican, Fusion, etc), I'm sure I'll flush out more, while also potentially hitting some dead ends.
Explaining what an API is, let alone the versatility and flexibility of an API, is really hard. I need as many tools in my API toolbox to help get people up to speed, understanding what an API is, and how it can apply to their business. We'll see where I go with the restaurant analogy, who knows it might be a dead end. It proved to be extremeley valuable in helping people understand API copyright, and I'm hopefull it will do the same for APIs in general.
Let me know your thoughts...

			<p><em>06 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>Download as PDF I spend a great deal of time looking at new APIs from companies, institutions, and government agencies during my weekly monitoring of the API space, and over the last couple years, I've come across an increasing number of APIs tht are out of higher educational institutions around the world. It began with a centralized developer area at the University of Washington (UW), and then I saw the same from UC Berkeley, with more recently noticing the impressive conversion of 250+ services from a traditional Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), to a more modern web API approach, at Brigham Young University (BYU). Along the way I began seeing that APIs at higher education institutions were going to be an important piece of the overall API puzzle, and as I do with any research area, I setup a Github repository (university.apievangelist.com), and began tracking on universities who were doing anything interesting with APIs, no matter how small. I now track on twelve separate higher education institutions that have active API efforts, and I have been engaging in active conversations with two of the institutions, regarding their strategy, working to understand how I can provide any guidance, but also learn from each team about the unique challenges higher education institutions face when designing, deploying, manage, and even evangelize their APIs. My university API research has now reached a level, where I have enough material to produce a white paper, so over the last couple months, I&rsquo;ve worked to compile all of my work into a single downloadable narrative. As with all of my API research, this white paper will change often, as my work is never done. I&rsquo;ll keep adding institutions, and evolving my understanding an awareness of APIs in higher education as long as there is meaningful activity to be found. The reason I produced this white paper, before I finished other papers I&rsquo;m working on for payment APIs, and&nbsp;APIs in the federal government, is...[<a href="/2014/08/06/the-university-of-api-white-paper-looking-at-apis-in-higher-education/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>05 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>I moderated a panel of hypermedia experts at API Craft in Detroit last week. One theme that dominated not just the panel, but was also pervasive in the conversation over the next two days of the API event, was how can the hypermedia space, improve its overall image, message, and potentially reach a wider audience, and maybe even converting some of the hypermedia skeptics, to hypermedia evangelists. After a session at #APICraft, dedicated to understanding all the hypermedia hate, Mike Amundsen (@mamund) and I continued the conversation, where he stated: When it comes to hypermedia, and technology online, reasonable just doesn't sell. This statement sums up my views of the current state of the hypermedia conversation. I went into the event expecting a very heated debate, filled with very intelligent, passionate, yet opinionated and hard-headed individuals. If you even lightly pay attention to the world of APIs, you probably have stumbled across the conversation between passionate REST practitioners (aka Restafarians), and the more recently the select group of hypermedia specialists&mdash;producing an image that is perceived by some as passionate, opinionated, and pushy, or even portrayed as being down right mean, nasty, delusional and confrontational by some. What I saw on the hypermedia panel last Monday, and over the next two days at #APICraft, was anything but the popular image of REST and the hypermedia community. I don&rsquo;t dismiss that some REST, and hypermedia practitioners can be rude, mean, and less than tolerant of those of us who don&rsquo;t quite understand every detail, but this group of hypermedia leaders were anything but. They were humble, articulate, and eager to better understand the hypermedia approaches of their colleagues, and try to understand how to better get the message out to the larger public. So where does this image come from? I think there are two camps, who are equally to blame: 1) The hypermedia pioneers 2) The hypermedia skeptics&nbsp;&mdash; the rest of us are just along for...[<a href="/2014/08/05/the-hypermedia-api-debate-sorry-reasonable-just-does-not-sell/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I originally started writing this post after API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam, where I had numerous conversations with banks, about the potential of APIs, and how banks might be starting to move from talk to action, when it comes to their API programs. After recent talks with a couple more folks, behind the scenes at banks, I&rsquo;m pretty convinced, as the enterprise are doing in other sectors, banks are slowly waking up to the potential of APIs&mdash;something that has taken a long time, as they slowly come out of their bank vaults, where they were hiding during the economic meltdown. When you Google the phase "banking API", you see the signs that the space is ripe for disruption with APIs from two open banking pioneers: The Open Bank Project - an open source API and App store for banks that empowers financial institutions to securely and rapidly enhance their digital offerings using an ecosystem of 3rd party applications and services Plaid - The Modern API for Banking Data, allowing developers to programmatically interact with banks and credit cards These players do not represent movement from the banking space itself, the conversation I&rsquo;ve had with Visa, Mastercard, Capital One, Rabobank, and others I can&rsquo;t even mention are notoriously closed about what they are doing, but these new open banking API platforms do represent the opportunity that exists in the space. Until I see robust, open developer areas from Chase, HSBC, Citigroup, and other banking giants, I won&rsquo;t declare APIs getting traction in the banking sector, but I think the ice is thawing, and I feel we are moving from just banks talking about APIs, to banks maybe, kinda sorta considering taking action when it comes to APIs. Hopefully I will get to talk about more of my conversations in the future, until then I will just showcase what The Open Bank Project and Plaid are up to, hopefully through public, competitive, and regulatory pressure, banks...[<a href="/2014/08/03/as-we-recover-the-banking-industry-seems-to-be-warming-up-to-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>When visiting an API developer area, as soon as the page loads,&nbsp;you can tell if its an organized effort, or something that was thrown up by a single project or team. Half of the institutions I track on as part of my university API monitoring have a centralized developer area for their APIs, as well as what appears to be an organized approach behind the designing, deploying, managing or evangelizing their APIs.&nbsp;  I&rsquo;ve talked with both&nbsp;University of California Berkeley and Brigham Young Universities about their API strategies, while only having light communication with University of Washington and Michigan. I feel there are some interesting lessons to be had when taking a look at these six leading universities.

			<p>While at API Craft in Detroit this week I had the pleasure of hanging with two leads on the WordPress(org) development team, and discuss the API strategy for the blogging platform. Andrew Nacin (@nacin), Lead Developer, and Ryan McCue (@rmccue), WordPress Plugin Developer, facilitated an open circle discussion to work through the challenges that WordPress is facing when developing an API for the open source blogging platform. At face value, I know a number of API developers who will be less than pleased when they hear about a WordPress API, as both PHP, and WordPress are easy targets for developer&rsquo;s hatred, for generating less than perfect code. ;-) But, in the end you can&rsquo;t ignore some of the stats on WordPress usage: Used by more than 22.0% of the top 10 million websites as of August 2013 Most popular blogging system in use on the Web, used in more than 60 million websites Over 409 million people view more than 15.5 billion pages each month Users produce about 41.7 million new posts and 60.5 million new comments each month These stats don&rsquo;t even touch on the number of WordPress plugins and mobile solutions there are developed on the insanely popular website, and blogging platform. I couldn't think of a better platform to start rolling APIs out APIs to the masses, and quickly educating a very large group of tech savvy folks along the way. Many of these WordPress sites are already integrated with popular API platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Google, and Amazon, so it makes sense to educate WordPress administrators on the APIs they are already using, as well as introduce them to the concept of having their own API around the potentially valuable content they generate. We Are Talking About Developing 60 M+ Distributed APIs There is no API deployment or management service provider that is even close to numbers of this magnitude.

			<p><em>01 Aug 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve been exploring one possible API future more and more lately, a future which centers around the a concept of being able to deploy virtual API stacks, by employing the power of deploying API resources in virtualized containers, something that will free individual API resources up for orchestration in new and exciting ways--doing for APIs, what APIs have been doing for companies. Driven by a recent evolution in cloud computing introduced by Docker.io, we are beginning to see new services emerge that get us closer to this vision of API orchesstration. Last week I wrote about how StrongLoop providing one look at the future of API deployment, using Node.js. This week I was introduced to another API deployment solution that also resembles some of these earlier thoughts I have had on API orchestration, from BlockSpring. Blockspring deploys a containerized API for any Python, Ruby, and R scripts, so all you do is take some code resource, deploy using BlockSpring, and it generates API endpoints, and a form interface for working with the resource. Blockspring provides documentation to help you understand how to craft your code, and a library to publish your API to, when ready. When you look at their API library, it even drops you into a folder called /blocks, which gives you into a list of APIs deployed using Blockspring, doing a range of functions from screen capture, applying image filters, to sentiment and text analysis. Blockspring enables, and encourages the design, and deployment of very granular API resources, that do one thing, and hopefully also doing it well, providing an interesting, and very modular way of deploying APIs--think legos. This deployment of simple, programmatic API resources, using a very containerized architecture, is an important new layer to the growing world of API orchestration, complimenting the simpler content and data driven API resources we are seeing deployed from spreadsheets and databases, and common file stores. I&rsquo;m not seeing a pure spreadsheet to API,...[<a href="/2014/08/01/the-emerging-landscape-of-api-orchestration-platforms/">Read More</a>]</p>

After bringing the panelists up, giving them each 10 minutes to introduce themselves, I kicked off the discussion by calling out a Tweet from @JeremiahLee: @kinlane I hope the conversation about hypermedia makes it beyond #APICraft to the rest of us because it still seems like 99% bullshit. &mdash; Jeremiah Lee (@JeremiahLee) July 28, 2014 First, I called out @JeremiahLee because he happened to tweet right at the moment I was moderating the panel, and second because I thought his comment reflected the polarization of the conversation around hypermedia. I personally know @JeremiahLee, and I know he&rsquo;s not a hater, he a super smart, and critical leader in the API conversation, but he Tweeted a controversial tweet, at the perfect moment, and I seized the opportunity. ;-) Hypermedia hating was a central theme to the event in Detroit, and I have several stories planned, hoping to further explore the phenomena, and make suggestions for moving the conversation forward, and @JeremiahLee provided a little more explanation of himself, so let&rsquo;s explore his position, and I'll add some commentary along the way: I watched the #APICraft hypermedia panel &lt;http://t.co/tfu7xmbCxh&gt;. @KinLane quoted me &lt;https://t.co/Wn2h0LYZWP&gt;.

To prepare for the discussion, &nbsp;I've spent time profiling each of the panelist, to help me, and hopefully you, better understand who they are: Mike Amundsen (@mamund) Mike Kelly (@mikekelly85) Steve Klabnik (@steveklabnik) Kevin Swiber (@kevinswiber) J&oslash;rn Wildt (@JornWildt) Markus Lanthaler (@MarkusLanthaler) These six hypermedia leaders, spend their time discussing hypermeida on the API-Craft forum, but it isn't just talk, each of the panelsts have each also contributed their formats and tooling to the discussion, resulting in 9 separate hypermedia formats to consider: Collection+JSON - http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/format/ UBER - https://rawgit.com/mamund/media-types/master/uber-hypermedia.html ALPS -&nbsp;http://alps.io/ HAL - http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html Siren - https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren Hydra -&nbsp;http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/hydra/ JSON-LD -&nbsp;http://json-ld.org/ json:api -&nbsp;http://jsonapi.org/ Mason -&nbsp;https://github.com/JornWildt/Mason To help guide the conversation, I've asked each panelists to give me two things that they want the audience at API Craft to walk away with: adding hypermedia to an API is a way to improve the API's usability (@mamund) the more hypermedia information in a response, the more stateless that response can be (@mamund) Hypermedia allows us to go beyond CRUD-influenced API design, enabling a task-based message design consisting of current resource state and available transitions. This provides a richer interaction model between client and server. (@kevinswiber) The best way to improve the state of the art is to see hypermedia applied to more use cases and have feedback shared publicly with the community. (@kevinswiber) What are the metrics of success for your API? How do hypermedia designs contribute to or detract from those metrics? (@mikekelly85) Is adding links to a response enough? (@MarkusLanthaler) What are the benefits of adding HTTP method and payload encoding information to links - aka forms/actions for APIs? What are the problems? Is it worth it?

			<p><em>27 Jul 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m looking through each of the worlds, of my hypermedia panelists, Mike Amundsen (@mamund), Mike Kelly (@mikekelly85), Steve Klabnik (@steveklabnik), Kevin Swiber (@kevinswiber), J&oslash;rn Wildt (@JornWildt), and Markus Lanthaler (@MarkusLanthaler),&nbsp;for API Craft tomorrow, reaquainting myself on what they bring to the hypermedia table, adding to my knowledge, and hopefully sharing some of the findings with you.
As I look through each of the hypermedia definitions, developed by my panelists, I keep feeling, that as API providers, there is still a lot of education that has to occur, to not just helping us better communicate with APIs, but also be more skilled at sharing and interacting around the resources we are making available via APIs.
I&rsquo;ve been brushing up my knowledge on Collection+JSON, UBER, ALPS, HAL, Siren, Hydra, JSON-LD, json:api, Mason--9 spearate format that contribute to how we design our APIs.
When I think about the state of APIs, i see that we are barely using our words in our communication using APIs, what we say, and how we are saying it with our APIs, is still very crude, and unstructured. I feel like we are just toddlers, learning to use our words, sentences and playing nicely together. With the rich formats available to us, I feel that in 2014, I think we have to collectively get our butts to hypermeida school, and get educated&mdash;a lot of the work has been done for, we just need to get up to speed.
I see a handful of API providers employing hypermedia in their designs, but they are still few and far between.

I like to showcase examples of companies who use their API communities as incubators, establishing them as a sort of external R&amp;D lab that invests in 3rd party developers who are building cool stuff on top of their API driven resources.
I came across an announcement from product intelligence platform Indix, in my usual monitoring of the API space, and they have a pretty cool program for their developers:
Indix KickStart &ndash; a program to help startups and small businesses accelerate the development of product-aware applications and deliver rich product-aware experiences.
Indix is looking to jumpstart early stage startups use of the Indix product API. Companies that have less than $1 million in funding and $100,000 in revenue are eligible apply, and Indix will evaluate the startups potential for receiving access to the Indix API at a reduced price point.
There are numerous ways to incentivize developers usage of an API, and Indix&rsquo;s approach is one possible way to established a trusted developer access tier, where you can raise access limits, reduce costs, and potentially reducing a new startup&rsquo;s overhead, and their chances of success.

			<p>I&rsquo;m in the middle of processing multiple emails, as well as coming down off an early morning conversation, all on the subject of analytics. A portion of the conversations are about analytics at the web site, web or mobile app level, and a portion of it was around analytics for API developers, as well as API platform providers&mdash;basically the full stack of analytics including platforms, developers, apps, all the way to the end-user. Increased visibility into the API layer, and how developers and their apps are consuming API resources, is a cornerstone of API management. There are numerous solutions out there to give you analytics in websites and web apps (Google Analytics), and within the mobile app itself (Mixpanel), and there are analytics at the API layer for both API providers, and the many developers who are integrating APIs into their applications and systems (3Scale). API providers, with the assistance of API infrastructure solutions like 3Scale, have done very well in making sense of how resources are composed through a service composition layer, that includes a robust number of metrics and analytics for both provider and developer. This is great for allowing API providers to understand how developers, and their applications are consuming API resources, while at the same time delivering a subset of analytics for each individual developer regarding their individual API usage. This is great, but if a developer wants more application level information, they usually have to look elsewhere to other tools and services. (this is evolving) After my conversations this morning, I was left thinking big picture about the future of analytics for the API driven, multichannel, website, single page, mobile, and Iot application stack. I am left with a vision of a tool that can handle all channels, not just the needs of the platform, and its developers, but also bring the end-users in the conversation.

			<p>I saw two tweets from Zapier the other day, where they were highlighting two separate SaaS platforms, who had integrated Zapier into their own platform. Both Gumroad and Hall took the time to highlight the other platforms they are integrated with. I think there are a couple of interesting items in these stories&hellip; Zapier &amp; IFTTT Integration A while back I added reciprocity to this list of API management building blocks, because I was seeing enough API providers, taking it upon themselves to make sure their platform had both Zapier and IFTTT integration. Ensuring your API is working with leading reciprocity providers will become even more critical for API providers, as more non-developers are putting APIs to work managing their daily personal, and professional lives. Dedicated Integration Page The fact that hall has a dedicated integration page is interesting. I think it is valuable to show the platforms that an API has been officially integrated with. It helps developers, and non-developers understand the potential that exists around a platform and its API. I can also see the benefit of opening up the ability for the API ecosystem to submit their own integrations as well--you never know it might encourage other platforms to integrate, if they know they have an opportunity to be showcased. I like how Hall does their integration page, and they 15+ integrations, they have a custom option, which is basically their very simple API, allowing you to post messages from your app. Hall doesn&rsquo;t seem to have a full blown API, allowing you to interact with all aspects of the platform, but I still their approach is interesting. I think that integration with reciprocity providers like Zapier and IFTTT should be default for all API providers. I also think that API providers should consider highlighting other common platform integrations like with Heroku or Github, depending on the nature of your API. You can consider providing seamless integration between platforms, as well as...[<a href="/2014/07/24/showcasing-your-api-integrations-with-other-platforms/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m a little biased at the moment, after participating in a Reclaim Your Domain hackathon with some really smart folks from multiple universities, as well as working on my first white paper on APIs in higher education, but I feel pretty strongly that higher education institutions focusing on APIs will extremely important in the next two years. I&rsquo;m constantly working to understand the big picture of the emerging API economy, the importance of the government API development phase, and working to understand what is next for the US government API strategy, while also acknowledging we need the enterprise to continue waking up to the potential of APIs. I think, right along with government, and the enterprise, another importance piece of the overall API puzzle is increasing the focus on APIs in higher education. The University Argument If I am making a pitch to a university, I would tell my Amazon API story, and how APIs can open up access to institutional resources, making them more accessible across campus, and externally with partners and vendors. APIs are how startups, SMB, enterprise, and the government are increasing efficiency, agility, and delivering the web and mobile apps that are part of a larger, healthier digital strategy vision. Top universities like University of Washington, UC Berkeley, and Brigham Young University or leading the way with modern API platforms, that are changing the way they do business on campus&mdash;take a look at the 250+ APIs from BYU, to get a idea. The Student Argument If I am making the pitch for why students should care about APIs, during the most formative years of their lives, I would point out that APIs are already touching every aspect of their lives, from the websites they visit, to the mobile phone in their pocket. If your college years are about preparing you for the world, APIs need to front and center in your education, giving you the basics, but also allowing you...[<a href="/2014/07/24/increasing-the-focus-on-apis-in-higher-education-is-important/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m looking through the most recent API server release from StrongLoop, and I can&rsquo;t help but see echoes of what I&rsquo;ve been researching, and covering across the API Evangelist network.&nbsp;API management has been front and center for years, but API deployment is something that is just now being productized, with a wealth of new service providers emerging to provide API deployment solutions that go beyond DIY frameworks, and enterprise API gateways. Let start with walking through their announcement of their StrongLoop API Server: LoopBack 2.0 - An open source framework for quickly creating APIs with Node, including the client SDKs. mobile Backend-as-a-Service - An mBaaS to provide mobile services like push, offline-sync, geopoint and social login either on-premise or in the cloud. Connectors - Connectivity for Node apps leveraging over ten supported data sources including Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB and SOAP. Controller - Automated DevOps for Node apps including profiling, clustering, process management and log management capabilities. Monitoring - A hosted or on-premise graphical console for monitoring resource utilization, response times and function tracing with the ability to send metrics to existing monitoring tools. Just as StrongLoop did in their release post, let&rsquo;s dive deeper into LoopBack 2.0, the open source core of StrongLoop, which they say "acts as a glue between apps or devices and data via APIs written in Node&rdquo;: Studio - A graphical interface to complement the command-line tooling and assist developers in building Loopback models. Yeoman and Grunt - The ability to script tasks, scaffold, and template applications and externalize their configurations for multiple environments. ExpressJS 4.0 - The latest update, for the well known Node.js package, bringing improvements by removing bundled middleware and refactoring them into maintainable modules, revamped router to remove confusion on HTTP verb usage and decoupling Connect, the HTTP framework of Node from the Express web framework.

			<p>I spent the weekend hacking away with a small group of very smart folks, at the Reclaim Your Domain Hackathon in Los Angeles. Fifteen of us gathered at Pepperdine University in west LA, looking to move forward the discussion around what we call &ldquo;Reclaim Your Domain&rdquo;. This conversation began last year, at the #ReclaimOpen Hackathon, continued earlier this year at Emory University, and we were looking to keep the momentum building this weekend at Pepperdine. Here is a breakdown of who was present this weekend: Jim Groom - University of Mary Washington (@jimgroom) Michael Caulfield - WSU Vancouver - http://hapgood.us/ - (@holden) Michael Berman - California State University Channel Islands (@amichaelberman) Chris Mattia - California State University Channel Islands (@cmmattia) Brian Lamb - Thompson Rivers University (@brlamb) Timothy Owens - University of Mary Washington (@timmmmyboy) Mikhail Gershovich - Vocat (@mgershovich) Amy Collier - Stanford (@amcollier) Rolin Moe - Pepperdine (@RMoeJo) Adam Croom - University of Oklahoma (@acroom) Mark C.

You can head over to Reclaim Your Domain, or you can also look at Reclaim Hosting, and the original Domain Of Ones Own at University of Mary Washington which has provided much of the initial spark behind the #Reclaim movement, for more information. Ultimately, #Reclaim will always be a very personal experience for each individual, but Reclaim Your Domain is primarily about:&nbsp; Educating, and empowering individual to define, reclaim, and manage their digital self The primary thing I got out of this weekend, beyond the opportunity to hang out with such a savvy group of educators, was the opportunity to talk through my own personal #Reclaim process, as well as my vision of how we can use...[<a href="/2014/07/22/reclaim-your-domain-la-hackathon-wrapup/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Jul 2014</em></p>
			<p>
In the API space it is easy to recognize the cool kids, the ones that are in the know. These types of personalities just understand how to get things done, don't take no for an answer, and understand the DIY, self-service nature of APIs.
I get a lot of folks who ask me to add them to my API Management provider section, or my API Integration area. I always add these people to my Evernote queue, and when I get time I go through and profile them, I add them to my master CRM, and when I publish the latest round of content and data to the API Evangelist network site in question, the blog post, or company listing will be updated&mdash;something that can take minutes or weeks, depending on my workload.
In contrast, the savvy people in the space, understand that the API Evangelist network runs on Github, as 60+ separate research projects, and that they can add themselves. All you do is fork the project you want to update, add yourself to the blog post, or the JSON file that drives the data listing, and submit a pull request. I don&rsquo;t always guarantee I will accept your addition, but if it is correct, and brings value to the API community, there is a good chance I will.
I just finished publishing a list of all of the SendGrid developer evangelists, and I mistakenly left off Will Smidlein (@ws), one of the SendGrid developer evangelists. Will, being one of the cool kids, didn&rsquo;t ask, he just forked API Evangelist, added himself to the list, and submitted a pull request. Minutes later, he&rsquo;s on the blog, listed correctly as one of the evangelist.
I wonder how long it will take for more of my audience to realize they can help curate, and publish to API Evangelist, right alongside me--it has been this way since January of 2013. ;-)

			<p><em>17 Jul 2014</em></p>
			<p>One of the things I&rsquo;m loving about where the API space is going, is the simplicity, and remixability of available API resources, when they are defined with machine readable API definitions like Swagger. An example of this, can be found in my recent work to make federal government APIs more discoverable. I generated machine readable API definitions using Swagger, for four separate APIs out of the GSA. The APIs were spread across two separate domains:&nbsp;usa.gov&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;explore.data.gov. You can follow the details of research, at each of the project repositories, but as I continue with my work, I keep thinking about the power that having a machine readable definition for all four of these APIs, and my ability to now remix these simple, and powerful API resources into virtual stacks. After I work my way through the 120 government APIs I have targeted, I will have an amazing index of government API resources to compose from. My vision around all of this goes beyond just API discovery, and finding government APIs. I want to make it so we can compose virtual stacks of API resources, that can be used in different scenarios. If you are building a public engagement app for an election, you can assemble exactly the API resources your developers will need, aggregate them using their API definition, into a single developer area&mdash;even though the APIs may span multiple federal agency developer areas. In this scenario, developers don't have to go find all the API resources they need, an architect, or API lead can aggregate everything into a one-stop-shop for what the developers will need. This evolution in API delivery makes me very happy, right up until I come up against the current state of on-boarding with APIs, to get the credentials you need to use the API resource. In this particular scenario, you would have to sign up for an account with 10 or 20 separate agencies, or outside groups&mdash;stripping away any benefits gained...[<a href="/2014/07/17/when-i-remix-apis-using-swagger-how-do-i-deal-with-authentication-across-multiple-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Jul 2014</em></p>
			<p>There are a lot of lessons to be learned from the leaders of the API space, pioneers like Amazon, Twilio and SendGrid, when it comes to running our own API programs. Fortunately for the community, most of the leading API providers are willing to share their experience and wisdom with us, such as SendGrid, with their latest series Tips and Tricks for a Beginner Developer Evangelist. The blog series delivers some great API evangelism wisdom, from the mouths of evangelists, who are in the trenches, getting the word out about the email API platform, and supporting its large ecosystem of application developers. I'll let you read the tips from the SendGrid team, what I thought was interesting, was the makeup of their evangelist team. You have two managers leading the charge: Tim Falls @timfalls) - Director of Developer Relations Brandon West (@bwest) - Manager of Developer Relations Then 8 developer evangelists, making up the evangelist team: Nick Quinlan (@YayNickQ) - Developer Evangelist Scott Motte (@scottmotte) - Developer Evangelist Martyn Davies (@martynd) - Developer Evangelist Robin Johnson (@rbin) - Developer Evangelist Kunal Batra (@kunal732) - Developer Evangelist Yamil Asusta (@elbuo8) - Developer Evangelist Heitor (Burger) Sergent (@heitorburger) - Developer Evangelist Eddie Zaneski (@eddiezane) - Developer Evangelist Will Smidlein (@ws) - Developer Evangelist And one distinguised hacker in residence: Elmer Thomas (@thinkingserious) - Hacker in Residence You can check out their full team here. I think the blog series from SendGrid is a look into, what it takes to run a successful API evangelism campaign. I&rsquo;ve had multiple conversations in the last couple days with API providers who are just now beginning to build their API teams, and were looking for on advice on who to hire, and how to grow and train their evangelists.

			<p><em>16 Jul 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve long been fascinated by the Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read project. i&rsquo;m on the mailing list, and try to make time to stay in tune, but have yet to ever contribute any bandwidth to the EXTREMELY important project, around making sense of the crazy terms of services (TOS), that we agree to in our daily lives. I finally found myself at a point where I'm forced to start paying more attention to API terms of service, and hopefully will be able to slice off a little bit of dedicated bandwidth to Terms of Service; Didn&rsquo;t Read. I have two projects that have floated up on my list, and deserve some priority attention. First I&rsquo;m applying the TOS Didn't Read work to a side project of mine called Reclaim Your Domain, which is a project to help me define my digital self, and reclaim some of the content, data and other value I generate on a daily basis online. I&rsquo;m hoping TOS Didn't Read will provide a machine readable moral backbone to the #Reclaim process&mdash;which is a work in progress. Second, I&rsquo;m looking to build on the TOS Didn't Read work, and apply further to the world of APIs, by defining another one of the machine readable API.json properties. The first of which are machine readable properties like API Blueprint, RAML, and Swagger API definitions, and the API Commons manifest, which allows you to reference the copyright for a specific API interface.

			<p><em>16 Jul 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m exploring different ways that APIs can be deployed, with an emphasis on deployment by non-developers. There are numerous cloud services available, that allow non-developers to execute common business tasks like registration forms, surveys, payments, and product sales, and when you combine these business functions with Zapier, Google Docs and APISpark&mdash;you can deploy an API, no code skills required. This story begins with the ability to deploy an API from any Google Spreadsheet using APISpark, putting API deployment within the grasp of the average business user. Next, I want the easiest possible way to get data, from multiple sources, into a Google Spreadsheet? Answer: Zapier (or other reciprocity provider, like IFTTT). &nbsp;To support this, I started looking through the numerous Zapier recipes, that allow my me to publish results to a Google Spreadsheet&mdash;there are 167! The most obvious data source I see is Twitter. Everyone time there is a Tweet from specific user, or from a specific Twitter search, you can have it published to a Google Spreadsheet, and when you have that spreadsheet connected to an APISpark API, the results will be automatically available via API. The second most common source of data I see, would be cloud based forms. I see providers like Wufoo, Gravity Forms, and JotForm, to name a few, that allow you to submit form submissions to any Google Spreadsheet, and with the APISpark integration, all your form submissions are automatically available via API. After that, I see numerous commerce, payments, and other key business functions, that Zapier enables publishing of data and content into a Google Spreadsheet from. All of these services have APIs, that is why Zapier is able to do what they do, but that would require a developer to tackle with custom API integration (not for this story). This story is all about enabling non-developers to deploy APIs, from common business functions, no coding necessary--Zapier is our middleman. Beyond Twitter, forms, payments, and product sales, I...[<a href="/2014/07/16/api-deployment-for-nondevelopers-using-zapier-google-docs-and-apispark/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
I&rsquo;m working with Brian Mulloy (@landlessness) of Apigee, to organize six of the leading hypermedia experts for a 2 hour panel discussion on the state of hypermedia, at API Craft, in Detroit, Michigan this month.  I couldn't imagine a more distinguished panel of hypermedia experts, than this lineup:

Mike Amundsen (@mamund)
Mike Kelly (@mikekelly85)
Steve Klabnik (@steveklabnik)
Kevin Swiber (@kevinswiber)
J&oslash;rn Wildt (@JornWildt)
Markus Lanthaler (@MarkusLanthaler)

The 2 hour panel is going to be broken into an hour of 10 minute presentations from each of the six panelists, followed by another hour of QA discussion between myself, the panelists, and the API Craft audience.
I&rsquo;ve started a Github repository to gather thoughts for the discussion, from the panelists, and if you have anything you'd like me to discuss, feel free to submit an issue, and I'll consider including in the discussion.
See you in Detroit!

			<p><em>15 Jul 2014</em></p>
			<p>
The elite technology group at the GSA, known as 18F, has released the latest copy of&nbsp;API guidance for federal government agencies to follow when designing their own APIs.
Using 18F&rsquo;s own description:
This document captures 18F's view of API best practices and standards. We aim to incorporate as many of them as possible into our work.APIs, like other web applications, will vary greatly in implementation and design, depending on the situation and the problem the application is solving. 
I like the mix of info that is delivered as well:

High level design guidance that individual APIs interpret to meet their needs.
Low level web practices that most modern HTTP APIs use.

To top it off, the API Standards is hosted on Github, in its own repository, and as Gray Brooks from 18F says:
 "Want a formal API Standards for your agency to adopt?  Fork ours, add your name to the top, and make it your own." 
Simple guidance like this goes a long way in helping, sometimes even very experienced developers, understand the best practices when it comes to designing, simple, modern APIs&mdash;a world where consistency and simplicity goes a long way!

During my initial work, I played with three separate APIs from www.usa.gov, which I think demonstrates the importance of CORS, and how opening it up for APIs, makes them more portable and remix-able. When it comes to the the three APIs from www.usa.gov, I do not have control over the API itself, but I wanted to create a self contained, site that showcased the government APIs, and provide interactive API documentation generated using Swagger. I made sure all three of the APIs had machine readable API definitions using Swagger, then I setup a simple HTML page, which allowed anyone to play with each of the APIs. This worked great until I reached the third API, which was at a different domain than the previous two, and didn't have CORS enabled. If you aren't familiar with CORS, or Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), which is a mechanism that allows many resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain the resource originated from&mdash;behavior that you may want to control on a web page, but for an API it is something you want to encourage. CORS being enabled, is the difference between an API being portable, and remix-able, and it being locked down to its original developer portal. If an API is RESTful and has CORS enabled, any outside party (like me), can generate a machine readable API definitions for it, and compose a developer experience, that that includes the API&mdash;with or without consent of the original API provider.

I wanted to make sure that when this new, and extremely important individual assumes their role, they have my latest thoughts on how to make the Department of Commerce developer portal the best it possibly can be, because this port will be the driving force behind the rapidly expanding API driven economy. Secretary Pritzker does a pretty good job of summing up the scope of resources that are available at Commerce: Secretary Pritzker described how the Department of Commerce&rsquo;s data collection &ndash; which literally reaches from the depths of the ocean to the surface of the sun &ndash; not only informs trillions of dollars of private and public investments each year and plants the seeds of economic growth, but also saves lives. I think she also does a fine job of describing the urgency behind making sure Commerce resources are available: Because of Commerce Department data, Secretary Pritzker explained, communities vulnerable to tornadoes have seen warning times triple and tornado warning accuracy double over the past 25 years, giving residents greater time to search for shelter in the event of an emergency. To understand the importance of content, data and other resources that are coming out the Department of Commerce, you just have to look at the list of agencies that are underneath Commerce, who already have API initiatives: Bureau of Economic Analysis Bureau of the Census International Trade Administration (ITA) National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Telecommunications and Information Administration Patent and Trademark Office Then take a look at the other half, who have not launched APIs: Bureau of Industry and Security Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements Economics and Statistics Administration Economic Development Administration (EDA) Minority Business Development Agency National Technical Information Service The data and other resources available through these agencies,...[<a href="/2014/07/15/chief-data-officer-needs-to-make-the-department-of-commerce-developer-portal-the-center-of-api-economy/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Swagger is now Open API Definition Format (OADF) -- READ MORE One conversation I had at #Gluecon this year, was around the role an API plays in being a contract between providers and consumers, with Tony Tam (@fehguy) from Reverb. API contract, is a common phrase to describe how API services are consumed, and depending on the on-boarding process, an API provider and consumer can enter into a contract for services around a set of resources, in a self-service way. In the last couple years, with the increased use of API definition formats like API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML, we often reference this API definition as a tangible representation of the contract API providers and consumers enter into. In my mind, I see the API definition as one building block, in a larger set of building blocks, that are working together to form a contract, with the API definition acting as the truth. If you step back and look across multiple API providers, you start to see a variety of building blocks that contribute to the overall "API Contract", that is negotiated between API provider and consumer, starting with the API definition. Definition A machine readable definition of an API interface, using a common format like API Blueprint, Swagger or RAML, providing a definition of the surface area of the resources that are available via API. API definitions are proving to be very useful in establishing a common way to describe, communicate and collaborate around APIs, which are often extremely abstract. Terms of Service Terms of service are the legal portion of the API contract, determining how the service can be used, keeping the company&rsquo;s interest in mind, but should also be liberal enough to allow developers and 3rd party integrators to be successful. Plain english version of terms of service go a long way in seamlessly fitting into the API contract, allowing API consumers to quickly understand where they stand.

			<p><em>14 Jul 2014</em></p>
			<p>It is a pretty basic concept&mdash;look at other competing or complimentary APIs in the space, before designing your own. This seems like common sense to me, but I look at APIs for a living, and I&rsquo;m interested in finding the best API patterns across business or government sectors. Even though this topic seems like a no-brainer to me, I still encounter many folks who contact me to discuss their API strategy, but have not looked at any APIs, in the same genre as the one they are looking to enter--which tells me I should be writing about this topic on a regular basis. My first advice to any API provider, looking to begin new API effort, is to&nbsp;look at as many of the leading APIs out there, as you have time for. Even if they aren&rsquo;t in the same genre as your API, they are leaders for a reason, and do many things that you can learn from. If nothing else, at least look at the pioneers like SalesForce, Amazon, Twitter and Google&mdash;they know what they are doing. Secondarily I urge developers to go look at any APIs that are doing the same thing, or portentially exist in the same genre, as your API. If you are doing a bookmark API, go look at Delicious and Pinboard. If you are doing an image API go look at Flickr and Instagram. Even if your API will be slightly different, you should look at all, accessible, patterns, that are similar to what you are trying to do do. Try to understand why these APis providers designed their interface the way they did, and actually make calls against the API, to see what you like, and what you don&rsquo;t like about their approach. Once you have looked at all the APIs you can, take the best patterns you found, and make it into your own.

			<p>I spoke with the leading financial data API aggregation providers&nbsp;Yodlee last week, regarding their hunt for a director of developer evangelism. Yodlee provides an aggregation API that is designed for developers who need secure access to their users&rsquo; bank, credit card, investment, and loan accounts&mdash;if you think about it, this is a pretty critical API, in what we are all calling the &ldquo;API Economy&rdquo;. Yodlee isn&rsquo;t just looking for a junior evangelist, they are looking for a director&mdash;someone to lead the charge, when it comes to evangelizing Yodlee to potential API consumers, while also supporting the community and applications that are already integrated with the financial data aggregation platform. While there are well published job descriptions for the API evangelist role, there are no universities training up, cranking out the next generation of evangelism leaders&mdash;they are a unique breed, leaving a major hurdle for API providers like Yodlee to jump. Evangelists are equal parts engineer, business development, product development, sales, and marketing&mdash;a combination that is not easy to find. Yodlee and I discussed the difficulties of finding the right candidates for the role, and whether or not you emphasize the technical or the marketing skills? There are extremely few candidates who know they are evangelist material, you often have to sculpt one out of many different personality traits, and both technical and business skils. Evangelism talent, at both junior, and leadership levels is going to continue to be a major stumbling block for the expanding API economy. Even with some movement in the world of API discovery in 2014, we will never be able to fully automate API discovery, let alone evangelism, management and support. At some point we are going to need more agencies, and institutions focusing on training up the next generation of evangelists, similar to social media marketing did in the last 5 years&mdash;of course, hopefully we can scale a little more sensibly, than the social media marketing world did.

			<p>
The&nbsp;API monitoring service AutoDevot has opened sourced their JavaScript API monitoring solution, built on Frisby.js, called API Monitor Runner. The API monitoring tool, allows for a pretty robust configuration file, that lets you detail exactly what the service should monitor, and how it should behave when something out of the ordinary happens.
I though the trigger actions stood out, allowing you to take common actions when something occurs with an API:

TRIGGER_EMAIL - enable email notification
TRIGGER_PAGER_DUTY - enable PagerDuty notification
TRIGGER_WEBHOOK - enable a generic webhook notification
TRIGGER_HIPCHAT- enable HipChat notification

AutoDevBot, even takes things to another level, providing a ready to go Docker container, to quickly deploy API Monitor Runner, and then configure it on setup, using Docker environment params--a very interesting approach to deploying open tooling to support APIs.
I really like this type of deployment for vital API services, focusing on providing a simple, valuable, cloud-based service, as well as an open source version that anyone can put to use. We just saw the same moves from 3Scale with the release of APITools, and now AutoDevBot with API Monitor Runner.
I&rsquo;d love to see other critical building blocks of the API economy emulate this approach&mdash;there is plenty of money to be made from cloud services, while also providing open tool that will stimulate API growth across many business sectors. Which, creates more need for services.

Climate Data Online Web Services&nbsp;- Just a clean, valuable, well done API for government. National Climate Data Center - Nice portal, valuable datasets, just needs some nice APIs and BOOM!

While I wanted to evaluate the quality and approach of each of the agencies, my goal for this review cycle was to look for any APIs that already had machine readable API definitions, or would be low hanging fruit for the creation of Swagger definitions, as part of my wider API discovery work. I had just finished updating all my API Evangelist Network APIs to use verion 0.14 of APIs.json, and while I wait for the search engine APIs.io to update to support the new version, I wanted to see if I could start the hard work of applying API discovery to federal government APIs.&nbsp; Ideally all federal agencies would publish APIs.json on their own, placing it within the root of their domain, like they do with data.json, and provide an index of all of their APIs. Being all to familiar with how this stuff work, I know that if I want this to happen, I will have to generate APIs.json for many federal agencies first. However for the APis.json to have their intended impact, I need many of the APIs to have machine readable API definitions that I can point to--which equals more work for me! yay? ;-( My thinking is that I will look through all of the 77 developer areas, and resulting APIs looking for the low hanging fruit. Basically I would grade each API on its viability to be included in my federal government API discovery work. I spent minimal amount of time look at each API, and in some cases looking for the API, before giving up.

			<p><em>10 Jul 2014</em></p>
			<p>I recently updated my APIs.json files for all my API Evangelist network domains, to use version 0.14, which is getting pretty close to a stable version. While I await APIs.io to be updated to use this version, I wanted to to spend some time publishing APIs.json files, but this time across federal government APIs. The thing I like most about APIs.json, is that you can do one for anybody else&rsquo;s APIs. In the case of our federal government, I don't anticipate any agency getting on board with APIs.json anytime soon, but I can do it for them! There are a lot of APIs in federal government, where do I get started? To help me understand the scope of API discovery in our federal government I looked through 77 developer portals, outlined by 18F. While browsing these developer portals for federal government agencies, I look at almost 190 APIs--with a goal of&nbsp;identifying the low hanging fruit, when it came to API discovery across hundreds of government APIs. Out of the 190 APIs, around 120 of them were actual web APIs, that were something I felt I could work with. I settled on a handful of APIs out of the GSA, hosted at www.usa.gov, and explore.data.gov, and got to work creating APIs.json for their APIs. Before I could generate an APIs.json at each of the two domains (www.usa.gov and explore.data.gov), I needed machine readable API definition for the four APIs. I purposely picked federal agency APIs that were REST(flu), and were something I could easily generate a Swagger definition for. The federal agency domain API at explore.data.gov was pretty easy, ony taking me a few minutes to handcraft a Swagger definition. Then I moved on to the Federal Agency Directory API at www.usa.gov, and I was happy to see there was already a Swagger definition for the API. After that I tackled the Social Media Registry API, and Mobile App Gallery API, both of which I had...[<a href="/2014/07/10/applying-apis-json-to-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>09 Jul 2014</em></p>
			<p>An APIs.json&nbsp;file lives in the root of any domain, or subdomain, and provides references to a collection of API resources. The APIs.json is meant to be a lightweight framework, where someone can build a collection of APIs, give it a name, description, some tags, and the APIs collection points you where you need to go, to get more information about those APIs. For each API, you can define a list of URLs, each with a defining &ldquo;type&rdquo;, letting you know what to expect when you visit the URL. Right now, most of those URLs are just for humans, pointing to the developer portal, document, and terms of service (TOS). We are adding other API url types, that API search engines like APIs.io can expose in their search interfaces, like code samples, and application gallery, to the next version of APIs.json. These human API URL types provide a reference, that API search engines can use to guide human users who are searching for APIs. However, where the real power of APIs.json comes in, is when an API URL type references a machine readable source, like a Swagger definition, or an API Commons manifest. When it comes to API discovery, we need as many meaningful locations, that we can point human API consumers to, but also machine readable locations, that will help make API discovery much more rich, automated, and precise. Imagine when I can do more than just search name, description, and tags, by keyword, much like APIs.io works currently. Imagine when you can specify that you only want APIs that are in the API Commons, and openly licensed. Imagine when I can search for APIs that allow me to use all my HTTP verbs, not just GET. Now, go even more in the future, when I can search for APIs who have a specific allowance in their terms of service, with a machine readable TOS type for APIs.json.

			<p><em>09 Jul 2014</em></p>
			<p>
When I first published 11 simple API definitions, I had developed using schema.org, into the API Commons, I made a mistake when I referenced the Swagger specifications for each of the APIs. I linked to the machine readable Swagger spec, but not the raw JSON stored on Github, errorneously I linked directly to the Github page.
I want the machine readable API datastore, at API Commons, which is used to drive the API listing page, to be completely machine readable, referencing all APIs, their machine readable API Commons manifest, as well as machine readable API definition. As the smart folks over at APIMatic pointed out to me, I had been flip-flopping on this. Some of my later entries were machine readable pointers, but my earlier entries were not.
Now all of the entries in the commons, have machine readable references to both their API Commons manifest, and API definition. I've also added a &ldquo;format&rdquo; page, to explain each of the fields, in the the API Commons manifest format, to help API providers better understand, and not make the same mistake I made.
The API Commons manifest is meant to be a standalone, machine readable pointer to an APIs central truth (a machine readable API definition), and associated CC-BY-SA or CC0 licensing, and now, I think we have achieved our original goals around making this happen.

			<p><em>07 Jul 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve expanded my monitoring on the world of APIs, from just API management, which I&rsquo;ve been doing for four years, into tracking on APIs across multiple buckets I'm calling design, deployment, management, monetization, evangelism, discovery, integration, aggregation, reciprocity, and real-time. I am always working to understand who the key players are across the API space, but also make sure they are categorized into one, or many of these expanding buckets--helping me quantify things. It is always very interesting to see how an API service provider fits into more than one of these buckets, as well as when new players emerge to cater to just one of these buckets, like Apiary did with API design. Playing on this theme, I was introduced to new a new API service provider, called APIMatic the other day, who on the surface seems to cater to API providers with the automatic generation of SDKs, but really is a cross-over into API design, discovery, and integration, bringing a new perspective to the table. Generating SDKs Is The Carrot As soon as you land on the APIMatic home page, they state very clearly what they do "Automatic SDK Generation for APIs&rdquo;. You can search common APIs that are available in the APIMatic API marketplace, import your own API definition, or build one using their web-based user interface&mdash;which pretty squarely makes APIMatic for API consumers, providing clear API integration benefits, but via the generation of SDKs. GUI Tool For API Design The third option for generating an SDK from an API, is using the APIMatic web-based user interface, which allows you to build a definition of your API, using a web interface&mdash;no coding necessary. You can create a new definition, manage its settings, define endpoints, and the underlying data model. When ready, you can generate your SDK, which is rendered, I&rsquo;m guessing using the default APIMatic format, and then also allows you to generate mock APIs, and sandbox environments--pretty squarely in the world...[<a href="/2014/07/07/evolving-how-we-approach-the-api-lifecycle-with-apimatic/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Jul 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I talk about this concept often, but couldn't find any definitive post on APIs opening up a company, organization, or agency to outside ideas. This is something I hear from startups, up to federal government agencies, and from well known business brands, such as Absolut Vodka.
Absolut was one of the keynotes at API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam, this last march. Eva Sjokvist, from Absolut, walked us through the development of their Absolut Drinks Database API.&nbsp;An amazing story by itself, but one thing she said that stood out to me, which is an interestingly common by-product of the API lifecycle, was the process itself opened up the company, making it more receptive to outside ideas, and collaboration.
I hear this sentiment often from groups who are developing API programs at their companies, and you see shining examples, like from Edmunds.com with their internal API Summit, but rarely do I see a metric to measure API driven, cultural change. APIs don't just open up your company&rsquo;s assets and resources for access by trusted partners, or potentially the public, establishing a sort of external R&amp;D lab, it has the potential to open up a valuable feedback loop as well, bringing in new ideas that have the potential to change how a group sees the world--evolving internal culture.
The potential for opening up a company, bringing them closer to their partners and customers, or a government agency, opening up healthier dialogue with constituents, is the most important results of an API program&mdash;greater than any single application that will get built on an API.

			<p><em>07 Jul 2014</em></p>
			<p>I was exchanging emails with someone regarding API design considerations at their large institutions today, and where they could find healthy patterns for API designs within their industry. As with any API provider, they were concerned with emulating the best API design patterns they could, and evolve the design of their own services. They put it like this: ..."our APIs largely expose our internal mess and legacy design rather than presenting a well thought out, consistent view of the important resources and operations"... We all want to deploy the best designed API that we possibly can, but with a lack of meaningful API definition formats (until recently), and nowhere to go and search or browse for common API design patterns (something 3Scale and API Evangelist want to fix with API Commons, APIs.json, and APIs.io), it can be difficult to know exactly what is good API design for our respective industries. It would be nice, if all of the APIs we designed were brand new, perfectly architected to follow best of breed REST patterns, and we had all the time in the world to research and design. In reality, many of the APIs we design will ony act as a facade for some legacy beast of a system, that won't go away anytime soon. We are working to get more places like API Commons and APIs.io available to find the best API design patterns, and you should always look at as many of the APIs in your industry as you can, when designing your APIs, but most importantly, don't be concerned with a perfect interface--right out of the gate. In reality, we have to just walk a line between the perfect API design, and the ugly legacy IT worlds, we are building these API facades to hide. The sooner we get the first version of the facade up, we can then iterate, and turn our APIs into the mirror image of the designs we ultimately desire&mdash;until...[<a href="/2014/07/07/apis-are-often-just-a-facade-that-is-covering-up-the-legacy-view-of-world/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Jul 2014</em></p>
			<p>I am continuing my research into how universities are using APIs, and while I was going through the developer areas for the universities I track on, I noticed an interesting mobile developer toolkit, from University of Michigan. When you land on the homepage of the University of Michigan developer portal, to the right you will see some valuable resources that is looking to help developers think through the bigger picture of designing, developing, deploying, testing and distributing, mobile application that are built on campus resources. The University of Michigan mobile developer toolkit is broken down into four separate groups: Design Requirements and Features User Interface (UI) Design Graphic Design Usability Accessibility Guide Get Started Developer Guide Set Up a Development Machine Resource List Distribute U-M Intellectual Property Rules Licensing and Distribution Develop &amp; Test Choosing a platform Multi-device development Integrating Single Sign-On or CoSign U-M (APIs) Using Emulators and Simulators Testing Your App I think the resources they provide, represent a very long term vision around delivering API resources to developers, who will be building applications for the institution--something that all universities should look at emulating. You want developers, who are building mobile applications on top of campus API resources to be successful, so providing them with the education, training and resources they need to deliver, is critical. I also think it is cool, that at the bottom of the mobile developer toolkit, they provide two other links: Collaborate - Campus and local developer groups. Opportunities - App competition notices. They want their app developers to socialize with other campus application developers, and be aware of opportunities to compete in hackathons and other competitions--on and off campus. Developing mobile applications is the number one incentive for universities to deploy APIs, and jumpstart their API efforts like at BYU, UW and UC Berkeley, and&nbsp;it just makes sense to provide a mobile developer toolkit for developers.

I'm working a wider campaign focused on getting my shit together around my images, and part of that is continueing work I had started with my screen capture API, and launch more image manipulation API resources.
I have a wide range of needs to resize, crop, filter, and apply other filters to photos I work with, as part of my storytelling, and if I had a set of image manipulation APIs, life would be better--so as I do with anything, I got to work building an API.
The result is the first, in a series of&nbsp;image manipulation APIs. Right now I focused on some low hanging fruit, like applying filters to images, which includes Charcoal, Oil Painting, Polaroid, and Sketch. Next, I will tackle some more utility APIs like resize, crop, and rotate.
Like my other APIs, I will use my operational harness, and operate a cloud version of my image manipulation API, where anyone can access, and take advantage of my API resources. Using my API service composition, I setup access tiers for public, partners and internal usage.&nbsp;
I will also open source any code behind so that others can deploy image manipulation within their own infrastructure, or I'm happy to setup for you--for a fee! :-)
I have a number of APIs I want to get built, and image manipulation has been on my list for a while, I'm glad I finally was able to get this work started.

I have a lot of ideas while being the API Evangelist. It just comes with the territory. I have an Evernote folder that I publish these ideas to, and some of them, like my Screen Capture API, I actually make a reality.
The other night while writing, Shadow API: Launching An API Before Someone Else Does, I went to add the Nebraska homestead record API idea to my Evernote, and I said, ENOUGH! I need a public place to store these ideas, and while I'm at it, I'll enable others to publish ideas there too.
What better way to allow collaboration around a content store or dataset, than a Github repository plus API. So I launched API Ideas, as an individual API project, on the API Evangelist Network. I allows me to retrieve, and add to a list of API ideas, all stored on Github, using a simple web API.
I&rsquo;ll be evolving the API over time, you can engage with me on the roadmap, and see stories around the project on the updates page. It is just a start, and I will be adding a lot more bells and whistles, and improve search, as I have time.

			<p>In the tech space, when we see a pattern that works, we run with it. This is why you hear, &ldquo;It is the Uber for X&rdquo;, or &ldquo;It is the Github for X&rdquo;, and I recently talked about how I&rsquo;m starting to see more of, &ldquo;It is the If This Then That (IFTT) for X&rdquo;. The IFTTT model, or what I call &ldquo;reciprocity&rdquo;, is an evolution on the classic enterprise ETL model, resulting in over 25 companies that I&rsquo;m tracking on in the space. Reciprocity works, because it is about solving a simple problem for everyday users, using APIs to take a single action&mdash;if this happens over there, use APIs, to do that over there. There are many other words used to describe this evolution of ETL in the clouds, including interoperability, and automation, I use reciprocity because it better describes what is happening as part of the growing global API economy. I recently went through all 65+ of my research projects, one of them being reciprocity, and as I was working on new research areas around open data, analysis, and visualization, I started thinking about how the IFTTT (reciprocity) model could be applied to analysis and visualization&mdash;resulting in a draft model I would call If This Then Visualize That (IFTVT). The IFTVT model provides the similar feedback loop as IFTTT, but instead of a resulting action, the end goal is a visualization. If &ldquo;end of month&rdquo;, show me overview of Foursquare checkins. If &ldquo;Tweet receives 10 favorites&rdquo;, show me a list of Twitter users. If &ldquo;bank account goes below $50&rdquo;, show me last 25 charges. How you get your IFTVT visualizations would be up to you, maybe it is email, maybe SMS, maybe some sort of iGoogle like dashboard unit. As with the IFTTT model, IFTVT gives us actionable, meaningful results from our increasingly disparate digital worlds.

When we conceived the APIs.json API discovery format, we knew that the project would be dead in the water, if there wasn&rsquo;t a clear incentive for API providers to generate an APIs.json&mdash;helping them get their APIs found. Until 2014, when you said "search for APIs", it meant going to a website (programmableweb.com), and searching for an API in a curated directory of APIs. In the last couple years, we&rsquo;ve seen an evolution on this directory search model from Mashape, in the form of a hub or marketplace. Managed directories have their place in the world of API discovery, similar to the web directory realm, but as the number of APIs grow, we are desperately needing to go beyond just directory based API discovery, and like with the web, establish a meaningful search layer&mdash;we need a Google of API search. This is why 3Scale and API Evangelist developed APIs.json, and the first open tooling on top of the API discovery format, we called APIs.io. We do not believe APIs.json + APIs.io is the next Google, but we do feel it will jumpstart the conversation around what is needed when it comes to API discovery. How do we find the best of breed APIs, not just on keyword search in the title and description, or driven from tags? We need a way for API providers to describe their APIs, and supporting building blocks, in a machine readable, distributed way, that can be indexed by many API discovery solutions. When searching for APIs, we will need to find specific API interfaces, with very specialized terms of service, and pricing. We will need API rating solutions like API Rating Agency baked into our API search algorithms. We need an extensible API discovery format, this is APIs.json. We need an...[<a href="/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>02 Jul 2014</em></p>
			<p>In a perfect world, every government agency, non-profit organization, and company would have an API, and the content and data available via their website, mobile applications, and other systems, would be accessible in an easy, machine readable way. This perfect world does not exist. Even though many government agencies, non-profit organizations, and companies are getting hip to the world of APIs, there is still massive amounts of work to be done, and I'm afraid if we want to see APIs across our government, we are going to have to do much of it ourselves. I was listening to an NPR story on the release of files detailing Nebraska's homesteading history, a project between the National Archives and National Park Service, today. I wish I could be at all federal agencies, in all meetings, advocating for an API first approach to these projects--I can&rsquo;t. So, while we can celebrate the fact that the records around Nebraska&rsquo;s history have been digitized, and the website is very nice, and usable for humans, THERE IS NO API! This is when the private sector has to step in and help our federal government realize the importance and potential of an API--we need a shadow API for the homestead records database. While the website is great for human consumption, we also need a simple, machine readable API that other applications can put to use. It would be nice if the National Archives and National Park Service had made the API a priority, but I think this is where the private sector needs to step in, and make it happen. I have direct orders from my super secret White House contact(s) to challenge you, Joe and Jane citizen to see who can launch an API faster, around content or data that is already public (no hacking)&mdash;the federal government, or you the average tech savvy citizen. I won&rsquo;t give up my sources, but I&rsquo;m dead serious when I say the White House asked...[<a href="/2014/07/02/shadow-api-launching-an-api-before-someone-else-does/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I'm always working to better understand the best of breed technology solutions available online today, and to me, this means, lightweight, machine readable apps that do one thing and do it well. One solution I&rsquo;m looking at is called the&nbsp;Smallest Federated Wiki, from Mike Caulfield(@holden), which has been on my list for several weeks now, but one of his latest posts has floated it back onto my priority list. To understand what the Smallest Federated Wiki (SFW) is, check out the video. I haven&rsquo;t personally downloaded and installed yet, which is something I do with all solutions that I&rsquo;m evaluating. SFW is Node.js, and available on Github, if you want to play with as well--I'm going to be installing on AWS if you need an AMI. This post is all about understanding SFW, and light the fire under my own use of SFW, and hopefully stimulating your interest. Simple Building off the simplicity of the Wiki, SFW borrows from the best features of Wiki, Github, and rolled together into simple, but ultimately powerful implementation that embraces the latest in technology from Node.js to HTML5. I know how hard it can be to achieve "simple", and while playing with SFW, I can tell a lot of work has gone into keeping things as fucking simple as possible. #win Federated I love me some Wikipedia and Github, but putting my valuable content, and hard work into someone else&rsquo;s silo is proving to be a very bad idea. For all of my projects, I want to be able maximize collaboration, syndication and reach, without giving away ownership of my intellectual exhaust (IE) . SFW reflects this emotion, and allows me to browse other people&rsquo;s work, fork, re-use, while also maintaining my own projects within my silo, and enable other people to fork, and re-use from my work as well--SFW is a sneak peak at how ALL modern applications SHOULD operate.

			<p>As I generate shitloads of content playing the API Evangelist&nbsp;on the Internets, I struggle with certain words, as I write each day&mdash;one of these words is intellectual property (IP), which Wikipedia defines as: Intellectual property (IP) rights are the legally recognized exclusive rights to creations of the mind.[1] Under intellectual property law, owners are granted certain exclusive rights to a variety of intangible assets, such as musical, literary, and artistic works; discoveries and inventions; and words, phrases, symbols, and designs. Common types of intellectual property rights include copyright, trademarks, patents, industrial design rights, trade dress, and in some jurisdictions trade secrets. I don&rsquo;t like the phrase intellectual property, specifically because it includes &ldquo;property&rdquo;. Nothing that comes from my intellect is property. Nothing. It isn&rsquo;t something you can own or control. Sorry, what gets generated from my intellect, wants to be free, not owned or controlled&mdash;it is just the way it is. I cannot be creative, generate my ideas and projects, if I know the output or results will be locked up. With this in mind I want to craft a new expression to describe the result of my intellectual output, I&rsquo;m going to call intellectual exhaust (IE).

			<p>I'm spending a lot of time updating my API deployment research&nbsp;lately, making sure it reflects what is truly going on out there in the space. In addition to tracking on legacy approaches to API deployment like enterprise API gateways, or using an open-source API frameworks, I am also trying to understand the realities of scraping data for deployment of APIs, and new solutions from API platforms like APISpark, StrongLoop, Orchestrate.io, and Import.io. When it comes to the realities of deploying an API, your data or content sources is likely to come from a myriad of file stores, databases, and other systems, and I&rsquo;m looking to explore as many of the as I possibly can. Todays exploration is focused on deploying an API, using Amazon S3 as a file store. I use Amazon S3 for all my heavy object storage which includes images, PDFs, XML, JSON and CSV data stores&mdash;it makes sense that someone companies would want to deploy APIs using their Amazon S3 stores. I&rsquo;m using APISpark as my API deployment platform, which allows me to first establish a datastore, which is mapped to a specific bucket within my Amazon S3. What I put into my buckets, and folders is up to me. I might use it to quickly provide access to my images, a folder of XML files, PDFs, or other resource. Once I have my datastore defined, I can deploy a simple web API using APISpark, which gives me all the expected features of an API&mdash;URL API endpoints, documentation, code samples, basic authentication (username / password), analytics, and much more. As with the Google Spreadsheet to API example I wrote on Monday, this scenario allows anyone who manages content and data, to easily organize it on S3, then deploy an API for access, with no IT or developer experience required. You might need to share images, files, or other content with another department within your company or organization, partners outside the corporate firewall,...[<a href="/2014/07/02/deploying-an-api-from-amazon-s3-file-store/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Jul 2014</em></p>
			<p>As I continue my research the world of API deployment, I'm trying to distill the services, and tooling I come across, down into what I consider to be a common set of building blocks. My goal with identifying API deployment building blocks is to provide a simple list of what the moving parts are, that enable API providers to successfully deploy their services. Some of these building blocks overlap with other core areas of my research like design, and management, but I hope this list captures the basic building blocks of what anyone needs to know, to be able to follow the world of API deployment. While this post is meant for a wider audience, beyond just developers, I think it provides a good reminder for developers as well, and can help things come into focus. (I know it does for me!) Also there is some overlap between some of these building blocks, like API Gateway and API Proxy, both doing very similiar things, but labeled differently. Identifying building blocks for me, can be very difficult, and I'm constantly shifting definitions around, until I find a comfortable fit--so some of these will evolve, especially with the speed at which things are moving in 2014. CSV to API&nbsp;- Text files that contain comma separate values or CSVs, is one of the quickest ways to convert existing data to an API. Each row of a CSV can be imported and converted to a record in a database, and easily generate a RESTful interface that represents the data stored in the CSV. CSV to API can be very messy depending on the quality of the data in the CSV, but can be a quick way to breathe new life into old catalogs of data lying around on servers or even desktops. The easiest way to deal with CSV is to import directly into database, than generate API from database, but the process can be done at time of...[<a href="/2014/07/01/building-blocks-of-api-deployment/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Spreadsheet are the most used datastore in business. When Google came out with their web-based spreadsheet, it was a game changer (for those who have access), when it came to managing, collaborating and sharing small data sets. When it comes to data management, not all of us live in the world of big data, and spreadsheets are a quick and dirty data store that gets the job done. As the web was maturing, Google saw an opportunity, and launched the labs version of Google Spreadsheets in mid 2006, bringing spreadsheets into the web 2.0 era of the Internet. In 2014, the next step, in the evolution of the spreadsheet, is to be able to plug spreadsheets directly into the API economy, allowing spreadsheet data stewards to make their valuable content and data available to web, mobile and Internet of things (Iot) developers via simple web APIs. Google Spreadsheets allows for accessing data via a JSON feed natively, and I wrote about adding an API, plus management layer on top of a public or private Google Spreadsheet, but there is also an instant, cloud-based approach to deploying an API from Google Spreadsheet, using APISpark. Restlet has taken their open source REST framework, launched it as a service, and opened up the possibility for anyone to deploy an API, from an existing Google Spreadsheet&mdash;no coding necessary. APISpark has provided both the API deployment, plus API management layer, spreadsheet owners will need. This is an important evolution in the API economy, because it allows people who are actually managing vital data to securely expose it, for use in applications, without needing any developer or IT resources. This will bring data stewards closer to the actual people who need their data, whether it be internally between systems or business units, externally with partners, or even publicly for anyone looking to use a dataset on a website or application.

Today I&rsquo;m spending a little time thinking through the big picture of APIs.json, and some of the building blocks I'd like to see reflected when API providers generate their APIs.json.

While we provide you with a base set of property element types you can reference: Swagger RAML Blueprint WADL WSDL TermsOfService InterfaceLicense StatusPage Pricing Forums AlertsTwitterHandle Our goal is to continue providing, &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; types that we recognize, while also leaving properties elements, being as organic as possible&mdash;meaning you can define your own references, and tell the story of why these are important building blocks in your own API strategy. We will continue adding the best properties we see being used, to the APIs.json spec. To prepare for the next version of APIs.json, I want to have the next list of reserved property types.

In each of these areas, I evaluate who the key players (companies and individuals) are, and the tools and services they produce. Using my own, custom developed system, I monitor these key players, in all of the research areas, consuming blog posts, tweets, code commits, and much more, trying to establish a deep awareness in each of these fundamental layers of the API economy. The goal of my monitoring is to help me in producing blog posts (short form), and white papers (long form), while generating valuable analysis for my research, and increasing my own understanding and awareness of the API economy. I have already produced white papers for API 101, History of APIs, API Deployment, and API Management, and I just now finished one for API Design.

			<p><em>28 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>We are still in the infancy of the API economy, and now with barely 14 years of evolving web API design, we are only just now developing the languages we will need to communicate around APIs throughout their lifecycle, from the first mock of the API resource, to monitoring of a production API in the wild, or making available to a new breed of API search engines. There has long been standards for describing APIs, such as WSDL for SOAP, and WADL for web APIs, but these formats would never actually enable the meaningful interactions around APIs that it would take to find widespread adoption. WSDL was too programmatic, and heavy handed, while WADL never possessed the incentives for API providers to take the time to define their APIs using the heavy XML format. It wasn't until early 2011, we would see the first signs of a meaningful language for defining web APIs, that would enable us to have productive conversations, and take action around our API designs. In February 2011, online word meaning and definition site Wordnik, launched a new API developer portal, complete with a new way to document APIs, that was interactive, and allowed developers to make live API calls, while learning about an API. In an effort to keep their API documentation up to date, Wordnik has also established a new way to not just document and communicate with an API, but allow us to actually have a shared conversation about the actual design of the API itself. Later on that year, API management provider Mashery emulated Wordnik's approach, and launched their I/O Docs. Immediately after, in August 2011, Wordnik formally launched their approach to defining APIs, generate interactive documentation, and server or client side code&mdash;which they called Swagger. Over the next two years the Swagger ecosystem would grow and evolve, producing new versions, tooling, and implementations of both private and public API implementations. During this time, the concept of API...[<a href="/2014/06/28/developing-the-language-we-need-to-communicate-throughout-the-api-lifecycle/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for common patterns that are working within the API space, and shine light on them, work to understand why they work, so that others can emulate these successful patterns in the space. One approach I&rsquo;ve seen work well, in many situations, is a combination of open source and a Platform as a Service (PaaS), and I&rsquo;m going to highlight the implementation of this model by one of the API Evangelist partners&mdash;Restlet / APISpark. Open Source For Developers First and foremost, Restlet is an open source web API framework, that any developer can download, and install to deliver their own API. The community benefits from this, Restlet benefits from this&mdash;open source API tooling is a fundamental building block for all of this to work. Many companies feel that open sourcing their core platform is just giving away their intellectual property, when in reality many consumers of your software won&rsquo;t have the resources to implement on their own, and will still need consulting resources to get the solution off the ground. Platform as a Service (PaaS) For Everyone If you want the power of Restlet, but don&rsquo;t have the time or resources to download and install, and you just want to get up and running with APIs, Restlet provides a PaaS version of Restlet, called APISpark. Using APISpark, anyone can deploy an API from new or existing data or file stores--no coding resources necessary. APISpark is a natural companion for Restlet, providing an out-of-the-box web API framework, that anyone can put to use--providing a viable commercial layer built on top of the open source Restlet.&nbsp; Professional Services For Everything Else Of course, at any stage of development, whether you are looking to put Restlet or APISpark to work, there are professional services to help you achieve your goals. The Restlet team provides professional services, commercial licensing, and other opportunities to get the skills and resources you need to make your API deployment...[<a href="/2014/06/27/the-restlet-open-source-and-api-spark-cloud-business-model/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I had several folks point me to the Nest API release the other day. I enjoy this, because I&rsquo;m not always the fastest in finding news&mdash;eventually I&rsquo;ll find it, but I rely on my human API monitoring network, just as much as my algorithmic API monitoring network, to bring stories to my attention. I&rsquo;m still reviewing the Nest API release, but one thing that stood out to me, was how real-time is baked into the API by default, and specifically using Firebase.
The Nest API documentation states:
Use the official Firebase client libraries (Web, iOS, Java, and Node), which allow you to synchronize your data with a subscription-based, near-real time platform. As you develop your client, you'll find these resources useful: Firebase Data Structure, Reading and Writing data.
Nest also provides options, if you can&rsquo;t use the Firebase library (not sure why this would be):
In cases where the platform you're developing your integration on has no available Firebase library, you may want to use REST or REST Streaming instead.
I track on real-time technology like Firebase as part of my API trends research, and much like other trends like aggregation and reciprocity,&nbsp;I think we&rsquo;ll start seeing these trending layers baked into API operations by default. I&rsquo;ve seen APIs reference default API reciprocity, using platforms like Zapier, and I think we&rsquo;ll see more APIs adopt real-time frameworks by default in the future.

API providers need to focus on what they do best, providing API access to their valuable data, content and other programmatic resources. It is wise for providers to leverage existing providers to deliver real-time, aggregation, reciprocity, voice, and other complimentary API layers. I will continue to keep my eye out for how APIs are providing a much fuller stack of resources for developers, using their own resources, while also augmenting with other leading technology platforms.

			<p><em>27 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m not at Google I/O this week, enjoying some downtime in SoCal, but I am watching some of the news coming out of the event. One thing I noticed, was the addition of monitoring to the Google Developer Console, where&nbsp;Google is slowly working their StackDriver acquisition into their fast growing API driven, cloud development platform.
You have to request access to the new monitoring services, and Google will open up "Stackdriver's monitoring capabilities available to select Google Cloud trusted testers at no charge&rdquo;. Wile Stackdriver is about monitoring your cloud infrastructure, it also provides granular level, API endpoint monitoring solutions that you can use to monitor the health of the API resources you depend on in your apps.
When Google makes a move to support a specific feature across its world of APIs, I take notice. Much like when Google adopted OAuth 2.0 across all APIs, I think their move to provide monitoring services, is a sign that monitoring of the resources you depend is going mainstream--something all web, mobile and Iot API resource providers need to have in place by default in 2014.

I participated in the API Summit at Edmunds.com yesterday. The event brought in API professionals from Mashery, Netflix, SOA Software, Ticketmaster, and EPAM Systems to discuss APIs, internally with the Edmunds team.
The API gathering was just like any other API event I have participated in, with a lineup of 30-60 minute keynotes from API professionals, accompanied by food, drink and networking in between, as well as after the event. The only difference was the API Summit was smaller and all about Edmunds.com, occurring internally at Edmunds.com office, and with Edmunds.com staff in attendance.
The internal API summit format is something that every company should employ. Following the trend of hackathons being executed internally, as well as publicly, let&rsquo;s move the API conference format that has been evolving from API Strategy &amp; Practice, and API Days, and bring it inside the corporate firewall to help get your entire company on board with APIs.
Let me know if you need assistance in making this happen, I am happy to help.

			<p>Swagger is now Open API Definition Format (OADF) -- READ MORE I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about API design lately, the services and tooling coming from Apiary, RAML and Swagger, and wanted to explore some thoughts around what I would consider to be killer features for the killer API design editor. Some of these thoughts are derived from the features I&rsquo;ve seen in Apiary and RAML editor, and most recently the Swagger Editor, but I&rsquo;d like to *riff* on a little bit and play with what could be the next generation of features. While exploring my dream API design editor, I&rsquo;d like to walk through each group of features, organized around my indentations and objectives around my API designs. Getting StartedWhen kicking off the API design process, I want to be able to jumpstart the API design lifecycle from multiple sources. There will be many times that I want to start from a clean slate, but many times I will be working from existing patterns.

My goals in getting started with API design, will be centered around re-use the best patterns across the API space, as well as my own individual or company API design gallery.

			<p><em>23 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>
It is a common theme, that government of any kind, especially the US federal government is too slow when it comes to adopting new technology. While this may be a popular meme for anti-government crusaders, and is true in many areas of government, there are growing pockets of resistance across federal agencies, who are not just keeping up with the latest technology, but they are leading.
An example of this is out of the Department of Labor (DOL), with their new Swift Federal Data SDK, which provides a powerful SDK that allows you to work with multiple federal government data APIs, using the new Swift programming language. Swift is only a couple weeks old, and DOL didn't miss a beat in getting a new SDK published on Github for developers to take advantage of.
In my opinion, we can no longer use the tired old meme, that government is just too slow to adopt new technology. There are an increasing number of examples out there that prove otherwise. In the future when you want to criticize an agency for being to slow in their adoption of tech, don&rsquo;t tell the same old tired story&mdash;point to examples like what DOL and 18F are up to, and incentivize the agencies to change in a positive way.

			<p><em>18 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m working through thoughts around a suggestion for future versions of&nbsp;APIs.json API discovery format, and as I do with other things I&rsquo;m trying to make sense of, I wanted to write a blog post on API Evangelist. If you aren't familiar with the format, APIs.json is meant to be a machine readable JSON file that provides an overview and listing APIs available within a specific domain. Authoritative APIs.json This is an APIs.json that is made available in the root of a domain, that is providing detail on an API that is managed within the same domain. This use case is for API providers to list the APIs that they offer publicly. Tribute APIs.json There is an API you use, and want to see it indexed in an API search engine like APIs.io&mdash;so you create a tribute APIs.json. This APIs.json index is not done by the owner of the API, but by a fan, or outside contributor. Tributes will weave together the world of APIs, when providers do not have the time. Facade APIs.json There is an API you use, but doesn&rsquo;t have exactly the interface you would want. Some resourceful API architects will be building facades to existing, external API resources. In the API economy you do not settle if an API isn't exactly what you need. The remix able nature of APIs allow for extending by designing facades that transform and extend existing API resources. Cache APIs.json If I learned anything working in the federal government last year, it is that APIs can go away at any point. In the future there will be a need for cached versions of existing APIs, providing redundancy and access to some important data and content. Aggregate APIs.json In fast growing areas of the API economy, we are seeing API aggregation trends, with sectors like social, media, cloud, financial, analytics, and other areas that have matured, and users are depending on potentially multiple API platforms.

			<p><em>18 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>
APITools, the cloud-based API integration services is raising the bar for the space by introducing an open source, on-premise version of their API monitoring service. APITools only launched this year, and because of consumer demands, they moved up the timeframe for open sourcing the platform, which was already on the roadmap.
I&rsquo;d say after API design, API integration services and tooling, for testing, monitoring, and transforming API calls is one of the fastest growing segments of the API space. We are seeing solid solutions from SmartBear, Runscope, TheRightAPI, Nomos Software, and from API pioneer John Musser, with API Science, but APITools is definitely raising the stakes with open sourcing theirs offering.
The world of API integration service and tooling is rapidly expanding, and only time will tell whether developers prefer running in the cloud, or on-premise, and what features they are looking for, something I've been documenting as I study what each of the companies offer.
I suspect, that along with other API design, deployment, and management tools we'll need a mix of freemium, open tiers, on-premise, and enterprise API integration services and tooling, to meet the demands of this fast growing segment that overlaps with both providing and consuming APIs.
Disclosure: APITools is a 3Scale service, and 3Scale is an API Evangelist partner.

			<p>
I recently reviewed a new API initiative from the Food &amp; Drug Administration, called OpenFDA. I gave a whole list of things that they did right when launching the API, but one item that I thought was particularly interesting, was the actual interactive documentation for the Drugs API endpoint.
I talk a lot about interactive documentation for APIs, something that has become commonplace, and a building block that developers are starting to expect. What is different about the OpenFDA Drug API, is that the interactive documentation provides a visual interface for building API calls, going beyond the interactive, and often very form based documentation that is commonly seen in other developer areas.
Via the OpenFDA Drug API documentation you can actually build an API query by selecting from radio button values, which then updates the resulting URL query, some summary text, and generates a graph visualization of the resulting query. After building your filter, you can run the API query, and see the request and response, which is a common feature other interactive API documentation implementations.

The addition of a visualization, that is driven by each endpoint is very interesting, and something I&rsquo;d like to see baked into the DNA of interactive API documentation.  Helping me build an API call, visualize and understand the value contained within an API has huge potential. Currently we have Swagger, API Blueprint, and RAML generated interactive documentation solution, which are pretty similar&mdash;I&rsquo;d love to see more visualizations integrated into future interactive documentation implementations.

			<p><em>16 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>After speaking at API Craft SF on Thursday, I kept the API talk going with two days of API car talk at API Days San Francisco. While there is a lot of focus specifically on the car itself, there was also a lot of talk beyond the auto at API Days San Francisco, which was dubbed "Disrupting the Car Industry and Driver Experience with APIs". Public Transportation In 2014, you just can&rsquo;t talk about disrupting the car industry, without including public transportation. With smart phones in our pockets, we need to get "smarter" about when and how we drive our cars, but also when should not drive our cars. Public transportation has to be part of the conversation when developers are looking to &ldquo;disrupt the car industry&rdquo;. Bicycle Culture I was pleased to also hear bicycles mentioned during several of the talks, and that developers should think about bicycle culture when developing apps. Many automobile owners are also bicyclists, and merging car and bike culture, expanding the opportunities to ride to work, large public events, or just for recreation, should be part of the consideration when developers are looking to &ldquo;disrupt the car industry&rdquo;. Self-Driving Car Skepticism It is easy to be captivated by the work coming out of Google around the self-driving car, but I was also so surprised to hear several folks express skepticism around whether or not the self-driving car will live up to the hype, and whether or not we even need the self-driving car at all&mdash;with investment around public transportation being a preferred alternative. When preparing for API Days, I expected the usual API crowd, educating people generally on the API opportunity, with a handful of high level car talks from people who have worked for the major car companies, or those working for aftermarket startups. This existed, but I was pleasantly surprised to see so much "out of the box" conversation as well.

One interesting theme I heard at API Days San Francisco&nbsp;last week, was the concept of API reciprocity, or If This Then That(IFTTT) moving into more niche areas. This edition of API Days was focused on "Disrupting the Car Industry and Driver Experience with APIs&rdquo;, and I heard several times, people saying, &ldquo;Its If This Then That for cars&rdquo;.
After If This Then That put an iconographic face on the classic practice of Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL), and focused on not traditional database and IT system, but API driven software as a service (SaaS), I saw over 30 other providers follow in their footsteps. It is my mission to understand how these companies are evolving the ETL world, and write about it across the API Evangelist network.
In 2014, I think the concept has reached a maturity point, where reciprocity and interoperability between API driven platforms is being applied to niche areas. With the popularity of IFTTT and Zapier, in helping tech savvy users understand how they can take control over how data and content flow in our increasingly digital worlds, it makes total sense that startups would look to apply this successful pattern to niche areas like the automobile experience.
While Zapier, IFTTT and many other reciprocity providers are providing general purpose recipes for keeping your online world in sync, there is a growing number of focused providers, like SortMyInbox for email, Puppet Labs for cloud computing, and RoadRules.io which was present at API Days in San Francisco.
I think this new breed of API focused ETL startups, delivering niche recipes of automation, interoperability and reciprocity in our digital worlds, will continue to expand. You will hear more startup pitches, where the founder says, &ldquo;Its like If This Then That for X&rdquo;.

			<p>One of the mutiple requests to review APIs currently in my inbox, is from the camera platform Dropcam. Every email or tweet I get, asking me to review an API, I at least click in to see what is happening, looking for that good story.&nbsp; Sometimes the API itself, can be good enough to be the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; that I tell a story about, but most often it is about a specific approach the API provider takes. Regardless, I look throughr all aspects of an API, sign up for an account, play with endpoints, look through documentation and code, and terms of service&mdash;trying to find any angle for a compelling story. When I clicked into Dropcam's developer area, I can&rsquo;t sign up for the API, play with endpoints, review documentation and code, but I can look at terms of service! Dropcam asks that you apply to be part of their beta program, before you can look at or play with anything. Dropcam assures me that their API is RESTful and uses its verbs, with all endpoints using HTTPS, and requests and responses in JSON. Dropcam uses oAuth for authentication and authorization, showing that all the proper technology and security building blocks are in place--thing is I need to see for myself. I can understand putting an approval layer at the point someone wants to take their application public, but if someone owns a Dropcam, they should be able to signup and start hacking on their device and the supporting cloud infrastructure. With modern API management infrastructure you have the power to control what resources developers have access to, with identify the bad actors, without limiting who has access to learn about your platform. Most importantly it prevents people like me from just reviewing the endpoints, documentation and the real meat of the Dropcam developer program. I&rsquo;m not building an application, I just want to write a story about what is possible, and without playing with it...[<a href="/2014/06/16/i-would-review-your-api-dropcam-but-i-cannot-access-it/">Read More</a>]</p>

I participated in an API Craft meetup this last Thursday, hosted by 3Scale in San Francisco. The gathering included Uri Sarid(@usarid)&nbsp;representing RAML, Jakub Nesetril(@jakubnesetril)&nbsp;on behalf of API Blueprint, Tony Tam(@fehguy) with his Swagger, and myself, discussing the fast growing world of API design.
While there are other formats for defining APIs, API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger represent the leading API definition formats, tools, and services in the space right now. I assumed we'd be talking about each of the API definition formats, but the conversation was more about how we got here, and the motivations behind generating API descriptions.
There are numerous reasons why API providers would want to generate API designs, ranging from the ability to mock interfaces, to generating interactive documentation that helps onboard API consumers. Having this conversation is important, as not all API providers are generating API definitions, and many of those who do, do not understand all the benefits of have machine readable API definitions.
Thank you to Emmanuel Paraskakis(@manp)&nbsp;who organized the meet up, 3Scale for hosting and sponsoring the conversation, the beer (which included Stone IPA w00t!), and making it possible so the leaders in the space can discuss the increasingly relevant topic of API design, and share the insight with the San Francisco API audience.

			<p><em>15 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>
Netflix officially announced they will be ending support for their public API. Its no surprise, as they announced early in 2013 that they would longer accept new registrations for the API.
While I think that Netflix could have put more resources into their API, and fought harder to make their public API a success, I still consider Netflix to be one of API pioneers that we can learn from when crafting our own API strategy.
While the public Netflix API was not a success, the internal and partner API strategy at Netflix was a success. APIs have allowed the company to scale into the cloud, grow internationally, and expand to sever over 1000 devices via their trusted partner network.
In addition to the internal API success at Netflix, they have been amazing at sharing their knowledge and experience with the wider API community via their blog, conferences like API Strategy &amp; Practice, and in books like APIs: A Strategy Guide, available on O'Reilly Publishing, written by Daniel Jacobsen, Greg Brail and Dan Woods.
Another positive byproduct of Netflix API operation, is that the company has been prolific in open sourcing the technology that goes into the API stack. When you visit the Netflix Github account, you will find a wealth of open tooling that they have worked hard on, and opened up for public use.
API success varies widely from company to company, sector to sector, and it doesn't always look like you think it will&mdash;this is part of the API experience. Just because Netflix doesn't reflect one vision of API success that open developers believed in, it doesn't mean Netflix as a whole was an API failure. There are plenty of lessons to learn from their public API failure, as well as their internal API success.

			<p><em>10 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m still extracting great examples of API design, deployment, and management, that other API providers can follow, from recent API projects out of our federal government, with FBOpen&nbsp;from&nbsp;18F, and&nbsp;OpenFDA out of the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA).
This particular post is about the approach to establishing a feedback loop with consumers of the OpenFDA API. If you visit the OpenFDA portal,&nbsp;you will find that API consumers can seek help via three self-service channels:

GitHub
StackExchange
Twitter

If you don&rsquo;t get your question answered by searching through existing Github, StackExchange, and Twitter conversations, you have three ways to directly ask the OpenFDA team questions:

StackExchange
GitHub
Email

What is notable (thanks Gray Brooks), is that OpenFDA uses existing services to establish the feedback loop with API consumers&mdash;meaning they use Github, StackExchange, and Twitter rather than rolling their own tool. OpenFDA understands that there are existing conversation that are already occurring on StackExchange, and developers are used to going here to find the answers they need.
Additionally by stimulating the conversation on StackExchange and Twitter you are generating valuable social media and SEO exhaust that will help new consumers, potentially learn about the OpenFDA API, and how it is being used by developers.  This type of feedback loop doesn&rsquo;t just provide support for community, it establishes itself as the heartbeat of your API, showing that someone is home, and is there to support and listen.
The best part is that using Twitter, StackExchange, and Github are free for public conversations, and take almost no time to setup. OpenFDA directly links to the form for asking a question on StackExchange, they don&rsquo;t for Github, but easily could. They also directly link to #OpenFDA hashtag to join existing conversations on StackExchange and Twitter, which is a pretty slick way to weave external searches into your API feedback loop.
Lots of good patterns to follow, from the leading groups deploying APIs in the US federal government.

			<p><em>09 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>This post should tell you about how behind I am in my storytelling&mdash;this story is from an event I attended in Arlington TX, on April 30th, and May 1st. While in Arlington, I spoke to a group of professionals who were crafting an online data &amp; analytics course. A couple of the participants were from edX, the online course platform partnership between MIT, Harvard, UC Berkeley and other universities. Over the course of two days, I had a cance ask the question, where was the edX API? Seemed like an obvious question, to which Emily Watson, the program manager at edX, responded, &ldquo;Its on our roadmap&rdquo;! An answer I get from many online companies, but Emily pulled up their roadmap on the wiki, and indeed it was on their roadmap. I told Emily, I&rsquo;d review the edX platform, and provide some feedback, that they could incorporate into their strategy. This one is easy, and is my basic feedback for any company with an online website and/or application&mdash;you make everything currently available on your site or application, available via an API. A quick glance at edX, these would be: Courses - The 175+ courses available on edX, should also be available in a machine readable format, via the edX API. Faculty &amp; Staff - The 400+ faculty and staff involved in producing edX courses should be available in a machine readable format, via the edX API. Schools &amp; Partners- All edX partners should be available in a machine readable format, via the edX API. You start with the low hanging fruit, by establishing three, simply designed web APIs for those already, publicly available resources, then move on to providing the essential business building blocks for any API: Dedicated API Portal - Simple, dedicated portal for edX API integrations, that isn&rsquo;t just for developers. It should be easy enough for anyone to learn about the edX API, without too much technical detail front and center. Simple Landing...[<a href="/2014/06/09/the-edx-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>06 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>My friends over at Social Health Insights, wrote about their experience being one of the beta users for the new OpenFDA API, and what they thought contributed to the success of the API launch from the Food and Drug Administration. What I found interesting about their post, is that contributing factors were not technical: Getting Feedback Early - The openFDA team solicited feedback early on in the API development process from end users and consumers of the API. This feedback was listened to and ultimately helped shape a very nice API at launch. Being Collaborative - If you are going to do #1 then you must be willing to be collaborative. From the get-go, the openFDA team collaborated with a number of stakeholders and was open all the feedback that streamed in. This ultimately resulted in a great product at release. Beyond the initial collaboration they are still listening and we bet they will be open to the feedback that comes in. Being Responsive - Send a tweet or message to the team and see what you get. You will be shocked at how fast they get back with you to answer your question. We saw questions over Twitter being answered by the community and openFDA team members within minutes (pretty cool)! Explaining Use Cases Well - Go to the openFDA website and you will see several queries tied to real wold questions about the data exposed by the new adverse event API. This helps consumers understand the possibilities and content of the API quicker and simpler. Beyond this, they solicited private beta testers to build solutions on top of the API which also provided additional sample use cases of solutions that could be created using the API. I am present on the backchannel for the OpenFDA rollout, so I saw some of the back and forth on the technical aspects of OpenFDA, and there was definitely lots of tech talk, but ultimately the success...[<a href="/2014/06/06/four-reasons-openfda-api-launch-was-successful-hint-not-just-the-tech/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">What Are The Incentives For Creating Machine Readable API Definitions?</a></h3>
			<p><em>05 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>
After #Gluecon in Colorado the other week, I have API design on the brain. A portion of the #APIStrat un-workshops were dedicated to API design related discussion, and API Design is also the most trafficked portion of API Evangelist this year, according to my Google Analytics.
At #Gluecon, 3Scale and API Evangelist announced our new API discovery project APIs.json, and associated tooling, API search engine APIs.io. For APIs.json, APIs.io, and API Commons to work, we are counting API providers, and API consumers creating machine readable API definitions.
With this in mind, I wanted to do some exploration--what would be possible incentives for creating machine readable API definitions?



JSON API Definition
 


Interactive Documentation
 


Server Side Code Deployment
 


Client Side Code generation
 


Design, Mocking, and Collaboration
 


Markdown Based API Definition
 


YAML Based API Definition
 


Reusability, Interoperability and Copyright
 


Testing &amp; Monitoring
 


Discovery
 


Search
 



The importance of having an API definition of available resources, is increasing. It was hard to realize the value of defining APIs with the heavy, top down defined WSDL, and even its web counterpart WADL, but with these new approaches, other incentives are emerging&mdash;incentives that live throughout the API lifecycle.
The first tangible shift in this area was when Swagger released the Swagger UI, providing interactive documentation that was generated from a Swagger API definition. Apiary quickly moved the incentives to an earlier stage in the API design lifecycle with design, mocking and collaboration opportunities.
As the API design world continues to explode, I&rsquo;m seeing a number of other incentives emerge for API providers to generate machine readable API definitions, and looking to find any incentives that I&rsquo;m missing, as well as identify any opportunities in how I can encourage API designers to generate machine readable API definitions in whatever format they desire.

			<p><em>05 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>In January I started taking a closer look at the world of API design, by reviewing the top movers in the space, Swagger from Wordnik, API Blueprint from Apiary, and RAML from Mulesoft. My goal was to quantity the world of API design, and help me understand where it might be going, or where there are opportunities for new tools and services. My intention is to write a white paper on API Design, but haven&rsquo;t reached this point, with the crazy amount of events and travel I&rsquo;ve had in the last couple months. Looking back, at where I left off in my research, the major difference between providers was that Swagger was JSON, and didn't have all the tooling that was available with API Blueprint and RAML. Fast forward 60 days, and I find myself at Gluecon, hanging out with Tony Tam of Reverb, creator of Swagger. On the last day of the conference,Tony shows me the new Swagger editor, with a new focus on YAML, as well as JSON Swagger definitions. With one release Tony addresses any gap in the space, leveling the API design playing field between API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML. While there are many differences between each providers, which you can see in my reposting of Ole Lensmar of SmartBear explored in his talk at #APIStrat Amsterdam with how they model REST, and what is behind the name, each of these top API design solutions will get you there, it just depends on your preferences. 60 days ago I would say that RAML and API Blueprint had a leg up on Swagger because of markdown / YAML focus, and with the amount of tooling they had. With one release Swagger has closed the gap, and with the traction they have amongst developers with a first mover advantage, this could put them squarely in the lead for adoption. I&rsquo;m predicting I&rsquo;ll have more time this month to finish up my API design...[<a href="/2014/06/05/swagger-levels-the-api-design-playing-field-with-new-editor-and-yaml-definitions/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>05 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m still playing catch up on many of my stories from over the last month, and one of them is the ability to publish your API definition straight from your API deployment using APISpark. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with APISpark, it is a cloud-based API deployment service built on the open source RESTlet framework.
Using APISpark you can deploy APIs from existing Google Spreadsheets, machine readable files on Amazon S3, or directly from a fresh datastore. APISpark gives you all the control you need over generating your endpoints, securing and monitoring the resulting APIs&mdash;all without any programming or back-end infrastructure.
For me, the best part is that once you have your API deployed with APISpark, it automatically generates an API Commons manifest, and serves up the URL you need to publish into the commons.

It means a lot that APISpark understands the importance of publishing your APis to the commons, allow users to publicly showcase their API designs, acknowledging that API definitions should be interoperable, and licensed for re-use. Thanks for baking this feature directly into your API platform, and ensuring all your users play healthy role in the API economy.

			<p><em>05 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>
There are numerous reasons for API designers to follow hypermedia patterns when crafting their internal, partner or publicly available APIs. One of the most fundamental reasons for offering hypermedia is to help developers understand what to do next, once receiving a response from your API.
Hypermedia APIs mimic the default characteristics of the web, and how you always know what do next with a web page, because there are many available links either in the form of navigation, in the body or footer. Reflecting this behavior, each hypermedia API resources comes with a set of related links giving developers clear actions to take once the response is received.
It can be easy to get lost in the numerous hypermedia debates online, not quite understanding all of the benefits of this fast growing API design pattern, but one clear reason is to help developers understand what to do next. Without clear instructions, developers can make obvious mistakes, misuse or misrepresent API resources, and be out of alignment with your own business goals in providing the API resource in the first place.

			<p><em>05 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>I am playing around with deploying APIs using multiple cloud platforms, and using popular container solutions. Next up is quickly deploying one of my utility APIs, to Heroku, complete with access control, traffic reports, and supporting analytics with 3Scale infrastructure. Application - Simple Screen Capture API I&rsquo;ve been working through an operational harness for deploying all my APIs, and the API I use to push forward my approach to API deployment, is a screen capture API. This is what I will be deploying on Heroku, creating a simple application, that will take screen captures of web pages that I pass to it. 3Scale Heroku Add-On To make API deployment on Heroku easier, 3Scale has created a Heroku add-on that you can easily deploy for any application you have running on the PaaS platform. With just a single click I added the 3Scale Heroku add-on to my screen capture API--now I can apply 3Scale API infrastructure to my API. API Access Control Using 3Scale I can control who has access to my screen capture API, by setting rate limits and quotas, and if I want I can even charge for access. I can compose any type of service levels for my API that I want. I will create tiers for internal access, external partners, and a public tier where I charge a fee for each API call. API Traffic Report and Analytics With all of my screen capture API traffic managed with 3Scale, I can now see traffic analytics and reports, broken down any account, application or for specific service. Any developer who signs up for my screen capture API, will get access to the reports for their account usage as well. Ready-To-Go Developer Portal One of the benefits of using 3Scale for deploying your API on Heroku, is that you get a developer portal to go with your APIs. This is where developers will to learn about your API, register for API keys, and view...[<a href="/2014/06/05/deploying-apis-using-heroku-and-3scale-addon/">Read More</a>]</p>
