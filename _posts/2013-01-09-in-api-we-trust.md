{% include JB/setup %}<p>If youve met me in person, you know I always wear my logo on my t-shirt. Im not a graphic designer, and when I needed a logo for API Evangelist, I just wrapped the words in JSON and called it good. It has stuck.  When I was in France speaking at API Days, the art director at faberNovel drew some very cool sketches of me. He recently followed up with some more high resolution images I can use for t-shirts.</p>
