        <span class="post-date">17 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/green-button/green-button.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />I'm preparing for a talk at the <a href="http://sgip.org/2014-SGIP-Fall-Conference">The Smart Grid Interoperability Panel Second Annual Conference</a>, in Nashville Tennessee, specifically participating on a panel titled "Using Power Grid Open Data Initiatives". I accepted the request to go speak as part of my wider work on the Green Button iniative out of The White House, DOE, NIST, and the GSA. I was asked to provide some thoughts on how to help move the Green Button efforts forward earlier this winter, and again in the spring, and just haven't had the bandwidth to give any energy, so I saw this as a great opportunity to make some time as part of this panel.</p>
<p>In May, The White House, 18F, some Presidential Innovation Fellows, and myself were asked to move the Green Button ball forward, resulting in a new website, and developer area that is all hosted on Github. I'm bummed I wasn't able to make time to participate, but now I have been able to go through the new site, and developer area, and gather my thoughts on where we could go next with the effort.</p>
<p>Before we get started, lets start with the basics, what is Green Button? Nick Sinai (<a href="https://twitter.com/NickSinai">@NickSinai</a>), Deputy Chief Technology Officer of the United States, puts it this way:</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>Green Button is a policy idea.  It's the notion that customers &ndash; residential, commercial, industrial, and yes, government customers of energy &ndash; ought to get access to their own energy data, in a standard digital format.  The Administration has articulated this several times, in a number of Administration energy, climate, and smart grid policy documents.  The government is a big customer of energy, and we deserve our own energy usage and price data.</p>
<p>Green Button is also a public-private initiative, in response to a 2011 White House call to action.  The White House, DOE, NIST, and GSA have been collaborating with the utility and tech industries on this growing effort for a few years now.  The White House has been convening industry and celebrating its progress. NIST has been supporting industry on development of the standard, DOE has been working with utilities, and GSA has been an early adopter.</p>
<p>Finally, Green Button is an actual data standard, for formatting and transferring energy usage and price data.  This standard can be implemented in both utility and non-utility contexts.  Customers can manually download or upload a file formatted in the standard, and IT systems can automatically transfer data between them using the standard.</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>The White House, 18F, and fellow PIFs, have done a great job organizing everything under a single, Github pages site, at <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>. The site is a big improvement over what was there before, and moves us closer to solving the fragmentation in the Green Button effort, which I believe is the fundamental issue that is holding it back from being fully realized. Green Button is a big vision, and it is going to take some serious effort to bring together all of the industry, and 3rd party efforts, and most importantly getting individual consumers on-board with taking control over their own energy data.</p>
<p>To help organize my thoughts on how we can move Green Button forward, something I will be discussing on stage in Nashville, I wanted to walk through the site, and take a snapshot of where we are at, then work on a strategy for what is needed to keep the momentum we already have moving forward. Green Button is an extremely critical effort in not just   empowering individuals and institutions to take control over their energy data, but also for the overall health of the energy sector, and whether the utility companies can see it or not, open data and APIs will be central to their continued success. So as I do with other areas, let's walk through where we are at currently with Green Button, to help prime the discussion about where we should go.</p>
<p><strong>First Impressions</strong><br /> When you land on the <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> site, it looks like a modern, clean website effort, with a simple tagline and meaningful image to help you understand what Green Button is all about. The first description is "Helping You Find and Use Your Energy Data", and then when you scroll down you see an answer to the question What is Green Button? -- "Green Button is a secure way to get your energy usage information electronically. I like the concise messaging, but it is solely focused on the consumer, and leaves out the commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, and energy efficiency organizations listed on the "use" page. I know this all revolves around energy data, but when you land on site, you should have the site speak to you, no matter who you are.</p>
<p>I think the "use" page does a great job in breaking down who the target audience is, but the first impression doesn't reflect this, and I don't think there is any path for these users to follow, once you do find yourself on <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>. As a data custodian, or 3rd party developer, I think the build or developer page will quickly speak to you, but as a consumer, you are quickly dropped from the focus of the site and will be completely lost in the rich information that is available. To on-board each user properly, we will need to begin to carve out paths for each user, one that start with a meaningful first impression off of the home page, then puts them on a path that leads them twoard action and the relevant resources they will need, depending on their role.</p>
<p><strong>Learn About Green Button</strong><br /> I really like the learn page for Green Button. It is clean, simple, informative, and not overwhelming for me to learn about what Green Button is, from any perspectives. My only suggestions for next steps is that we begin massaging some of the rich content available under "library", and link to specific learning opportunities from this page. Each summary should provide users with links to follow, taking them to the detail they will need to fully understand each aspect of Green Button as it pertains to their position. However, with that said it is critical to keep this page a simple overview of Green Button, and make it an easy doorway to the world of energy data.</p>
<p><strong>Using Green Button</strong><br /> As I said above, the "use" section provides a nice overview of who should be using Green Button, with sections focusing on commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, and energy efficiency organizations, as well residential consumers. What is needed for each of these sections, is a clear call to action, taking you to another page that is a "getting started" specifically targeting your role in the Green Button movement. I don't think the lack of this, is a deficiency of what is currently there, it is just the next logical step for evolving this page to better onboard users, now that these roles are better defined.</p>
<p><strong>The Green Button Community</strong><br /> This is the first time I've seen the Green Button community reflected on a single page like this, and is exactly what is needed to help reduce the fragmentation currently present across the community. Presenting the four groups in this way, complete with links to their sites, and relevant contact information to get involved, is very important for bringing together the community. My only critique is that the page could use a little more layout love, formatting, logos, and some polish to keep it looking as good as the rest of the site&mdash;nothing major.  Eventually it would also be nice to have some sort of stream of activity across all of these efforts, aggregated here. I'm not sure how this would occur, as the groups are all using different ways to keep members informed, but something should be considered, further bringing together the community.</p>
<p><strong>Build With Green Button</strong><br /> The developers section probably needs the most help right now, and I'm not 100% sure of how to make more coherent. It is a little redundant and circular, and its called "build" on home page, and "developers" in the top navigation, something that should be consistent. The RESTful APIs is represented twice, and i see glimpses of trying to provide separate information for data stewards, and 3rd party developers. Along with the development of specific paths for different target users, this needs to be reworked, and woven into those efforts, but I do like the focus on the open source nature of Green Button. The first time I landed on Green Button, I didn't fully grasp that it was an open source API that anyone can deploy, and that the sandbox version that is in operation is just a demo, something that I think we need to make fully clear to users of all types.</p>
<p>We have a big challenge ahead when it comes to helping data custodians understand what is possible, and hopefully we can help spur 3rd party developers in not just build around existing Green Button code, but also work to develop new versions in other languages, as well as specific cloud offerings on maybe Amazon or Heroku. The sky is the limit when it comes to developing, and building Green Button solutions, both server and client side, and we need to make the separation as clear as possible. It will take some serious architectural vision to help bridge what code is currently available for Green Button, and stimulate commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, and energy efficiency organizations in understanding what is possible, and incentivize them to deliver solutions that are quickly deployable across the cloud landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Green Button Library</strong><br /> As with the "learn" and "use" sections of the site, the current library section was a great step forward in bringing together the wealth of current resources available to support Green Button efforts. What is needed now is just the refinement of what is there, making it easier to access, and learn from, while also making sure that resources are appropriately grouped into buckets targeting each of the Green Button user groups. As I'm working through the the library of materials, I can see there are some seriously rich resource available, but there is a lot of disconnect between them because they are designed, developed and deployed to support different goals, by different authors&mdash;we need to establish some consistency between them.</p>
<p>Right now the library is very much a list of resources, and it would be nice to make sure it truly is a library that is organized, indexable, and is easy to navigate. Having all of these resources in a single location is an excellent start, but how do we start refining them, and making them much more usable by all users? Documents should have a consistent document formats, videos should have single Youtube (or other) channel, and much more. All of this would make it much more likely that these resources would be explored, an consumed by a wider audience, beyond just the alpha geek crowd.</p>
<p><strong>Green Button Testing Tools</strong><br /> I'm happy to see the Green Button testing tool here, but ultimately it feels like one tool, that should be in a toolbox. Right now it is its own top level navigation item, and I don't think a single tool should be elevated to this level. I would change this to tools, and make the testing tool the one item in the toolbox right now, and I'm sure there are others we can quickly add to the toolbox as well. As with other areas, we should break down the toolbox by user group, making sure consumers easily find what they need, as well as utility providers, 3rd party developers and the other user groups.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started With Green Button</strong><br /> I was excited to see the Getting Started button, until I realized it was just an email address. ;-(  That isn't getting started, it is sending an email. Getting started should be prominent, and truly provide users with easy paths to well...get started. If you are data custodian, utility, or energy provider, you should have a simple page that explains how to get started, in a self-service way&mdash;no email needed. Separately, there should be contact information for Green Button, something that hopefully includes much more than just an email address, with no face and personality behind it.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledging Where We Are</strong><br /> That is a quick walkthrough of where things are at with <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>, and in my opinion, things have come a long ways from what I was seeing spread across the Green Button landscape this last winter. Most importantly it is aggregating the community, developer, and the wealth of other resources into a library, which is a very critical step to continue moving Green Button forward. In my opinion the v1 tech of Green Button tech is in place, it is just lacking all the refinement, storytelling, and relationship building that is necessary to move Green Button into the consciousness of utility companies, 3rd party developers, and the average, everyday energy consumer&mdash;so how do we do this?</p>
<p><strong>Green Button Needs A Champion</strong><br /> First, before we get into any of the nuts and bolts of what we can do to keep <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> rolling forward, the project is going to need a champion. I think The White House, DOE, NIST, and GSA are doing an amazing job of making sure things move forward, but <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> needs someone who is super passionate about energy data, APIs, understands the energy industry, and wants to put in the hours necessary to refine the information currently available, build relationships, and generate new content that will bring in new players. This role isn't some cushy job that you will get a regular paycheck for, but for the right person, I think it could be pretty lucrative, if you get creative in piecing together sponsorship and support from industry players, organizations, and worked hard on the grant writing front. Essentially you need The API Evangelist, for energy data and APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Who's offering Green Button?</strong><br /> I think the first place to start is visible right on the home page, and looking at who is already putting Green Button data to work. I see 50+ entities who are already putting Green Button to work, so who are these people, and how can we showcase what they are up to.  There are some meaningful implementations here, and I know there is some great material here to demonstrate the power, and importance of Green Button, and help spark the imagination of new visitors.  Green Button has traction, the problem is not enough people know about it, or have the imagination to understand how it is being used. Let's take the time to showcase this, and create some really great content that will make the site more educational. This is something that can be led by the Green Button evangelist I talk about above, but is also something I think the community should also contribute to. I'm going to carve out some time to reach out to some of the providers listed, and see if i can showcase how they are putting Green Button to work, and generate more detail, and content that can be contributed to <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>. Do you want to help?</p>
<p><strong>Showcase Of How Green Button Is Used</strong><br /> Building on the work above, we need a place to showcase how Green Button is being put to use. I'm not sure this should be a top level navigation item, but if we group each entry in the showcase, by the type of user, I think we can make it one stop of the path each user takes, as they learn about Green Button. As each commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, and energy efficiency organizations, and individual energy users is learning about Green Button, they should also be exposed to examples of other similar individuals or companies like them that are already putting Green Button to work. This will go a long way in helping people see the potential of Green Button, and begin the journey of putting it to work across the energy industry landscape in new ways.</p>
<p><strong>Blog For Bringing Green Button To Life</strong><br /> The <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> site needs a blog. This is something that will be difficult without a champion to keep alive, but a blog is going to be essential in bringing the site to life, helping share stories about the value Green Button is bringing to companies, organizations, institutions, and most importantly the average consumer. Without a blog, any developer community will not have a soul, or a personality, and it will be difficult to convince anyone that someone is home, and that they should trust and care about Green Button. I think a blog could easily be crowdsourced, allowing passionate folks like myself to post, as well as other organizations, companies, and key stakeholders to post relevant stories, that will give the site a heartbeat. A blog will be central to any of the suggestions I will have to help move things forward, and give <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> a personality that will go a long way in building trust amongst users, and across the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Giving Some Coherence To The Developers Section</strong><br /> The developer section of <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> will be essential to scaling the effort, and right now the page is a little all over the place, and will take some significant effort to simplify, make usable, and bring the wealth of developer resources into focus. This will take some serious work, by someone who is a developer, architect, and can make actually organize everything into something that easily on-boards data custodians, and 3rd party developers with as little friction as possible. You have to walk them through the wealth of tooling that is already available, show them what is possible, and then give them the downloads they need to get things working in their world.</p>
<p>There is also a need for some other additional tooling, some of the current solutions are very enterprise oriented, and I think with some encouragement, providers could replicate Green Button tooling in other languages like Node.js, Python, PHP, and other platforms that will encourage rapid adoption by other providers. There also needs to be some ways to help people quickly bring Green Button to life using cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, Google, Azure and other platforms that companies and individuals are already depending on.</p>
<p>The developer section is something that will take some deep thinking, hacking, and architectural magic from the champion, and Green Button evangelist. They will have to look at it through the eyes of each of the data custodians, and 3rd party developers who are already putting Green Button to use, and try to deliver things in a way that will speak to this, as well as potentially other new users. This type of work is not easy, and takes some serious effort, something you can't expect to happen overnight. However, if it is done right this can really help scale the number of Green Button implementations in the wild, and take things to the next level much quicker.</p>
<p><strong>Turning The Library Into A Consistent Resource</strong><br /> I am happy to see all of the rich Green Button resources brought into a single location, but I wouldn't call it quite a library yet. It is a listing of valuable resources, that aren't really organized in a way that speaks to the different Green Button users, and are not consistent in form because they come from different sources. Even with this said, their is a wealth of resources available there, and with some work you could build a really nice, interactive library that can help educate users on how to put Green Button to work. Similar to the showcase, once the library is organized, and grouped by target user, I think the library can be a stop on the path that each user takes, showing them exactly the resources they need in the library to help onboard them properly.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing Paths For Green Button Users</strong><br /> As I discussed above, each user needs a path they can take from the "use" page to begin their journey. Right now the "use" page is a dead end, where it should actually be a call to action, providing each visitor the chance to take a path through the site that speaks to them, without forcing them to have to wade through the wealth of resources that are currently there. From the "use" page, each user can be taken to a showcase of other implementations from similar users, then depending on their role, could be walk through other sections of the site, landing in the library, presenting with exactly what they need to get going. I'm not exactly sure what the user experience will be on these new paths, but I think once we profile the existing uses of Green Button, and unwind the developer and library resources, a pretty orderly route can be established for each user group. These paths will go a long way to onboard users in a fraction of the time, and maximize the potential reach, and scale of the platform&mdash;adding more implementations to the Green Button platform, and scaling the audience with each new user.</p>
<p><strong>Taking Green Button From Site to Community</strong><br /> I will stop here. I think this is all that should be focused on for now, when it comes to moving Green Button forward. It is important to not bite off too much, and make sure we can be successful in moving things forward, and not make things more complex. The goal is to simplify what we have, now that we have everything organized into a single site, and begin the process of bringing <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> to life. With someone at the helm, an active blog, and a more coherent focus on each user group, I think that things will start picking up steam, and with more outreach, and involvement with existing Green Button implementations, and the existing Green Button community, we can move <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a> from being just a site, and put it on its way to becoming a community.</p>
<p>It is important that Green Button evolves to become a community. It cannot remain just a government initiative. Green Button has to be a vibrant community that commercial energy users, public institutions, utilities &amp; energy service providers, 3rd party software vendors, energy efficiency organizations, and individual energy users are all part of, otherwise it will always remain just something being pushed from the top down. Green Button has to be also owned by the individual energy users, and institutions, providing essential bottom up momentum to match the energy given from the top by the federal government partners&mdash;without this the energy industry will never buy in.</p>
<p>Profiling the existing Green Button implementations, and making the site speak to each of the user groups will be important for taking things to the next step. This process will help communicate to a next generation of implementations what is possible, and through regular showcasing and storytelling we can move Green Button beyond just a policy idea, and initiative from government, or just a technical data standard, and transform it into something that is a default part of the energy industry. In this new world, energy users will be used to having control over their data, and entirely new markets will be established delivering services to energy consumers, within this new space.</p>
<p>All the parts and pieces are there, and much like last round of work on the <a href="http://greenbuttondata.org">greenbuttondata.org</a>&nbsp;site brought all these resources together, we need to figure out how to bring the energy industry together and show them the potential of Green Button data and APIs. We need to make sure energy consumers, both individual and institutional, understand the importance of having control over their energy data, and show data custodians that this is the future of doing business in the energy space. Once we can achieve this, Green Button will take on a life of its own, driven not just by the government, or even the utility providers, but by the energy of 3rd party companies who are delivering meaningful solutions for institutional, organizational, and individual energy consumers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The conversation around open data and APIs in government is dominated by talk of making resources available to the public, which is a good thing, but is only 1/3 of the discussion that should be occurring amongst gov-focused techies, as well as the project owners, and data stewards who are managing these vital public resources across federal agencies.</p>
<p>APIs are not just deployed to support public access to resources, this has just been the trend that is getting all the headlines, and there is still lot of value to be realized when putting APIs to work within an agency, opening up access to data, content, and other digital resources, increasing efficiency agency-wide using Internet technology. The best example of this in action is out of the private sector from Amazon, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">story of the important role internal APIs have played in the company's success</a>, across internal operations, but also in the public as a commerce, and a cloud computing leader.</p>
<p>To help you relate to the idea of an internal API, think of all the times you've had to ask IT for access to something from a database, like a list of facility locations, government programs, or maybe an employee directory. You have to find out where the source of these resources are, track down the right contact information, then put in a request to get a copy of the data or content you are looking for. Often times even once you get the data dump, it could be the wrong information, or missing what you are needing, requiring you to go back, yet again, to get what you are looking for--not very efficient, and also extremely frustrating.</p>
<p><strong>Access To The Resources You Need</strong><br /> When you open up data or content via an API, despite common belief, you aren't necessarily making the information available to anyone on the open Internet, you are just using Internet technology to make it accessible. In some cases, you may publish the fact that the information is available in a public location, but can require that only internal staff has access to it. Regardless of exactly how you approach, the information, and registration for access of an API should always be available in a self-service way, allowing anyone to discover, and gain access without requesting permission from IT, or having to hunt down the source. In a perfect API world every agency will have a central API area where anyone can find all the resources available across the agency, eliminating many of the bottlenecks that commonly exist across government.</p>
<p><strong>APIs Are Not Just For Developers</strong><br /> Developers would like to think APIs are just for them, but this is a reflection of the historic power and control IT has wielded when controlling access to databases, file stores, and other digital resources that are used across government agencies. Sure, APIs require knowing how to access the resource, and potentially the ability to write code that will pull, parse, and publish information to where it is needed, but APIs can just as easily be connected to spreadsheets, documents, and have ready to go HTML listings, details, and other fully functional widgets. This approach to API consumption has been pioneered by private sector technology companies, allowing tech savvy users to reverse engineer API access or put to use as is&mdash;no development experience necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Data And Content Kept Up To Date In Realtime</strong><br /> Without APIs, when you finally do get the list of facilities, programs or contacts from IT, it might already be out of date. If you are requiring IT to provide a dump of data in XML, CSV, spreadsheet or other format, it is just that&mdash;a dump. Any changes made in the central database will not be reflected in your dump, rendering your work obsolete, and potentially turning it from information, to misinformation. APIs allow you to keep a connection between the information source, and your web and mobile application, spreadsheet or other system, up to date in realtime. Even if updating your project is manual, at least you have a realtime connection to the original source that you can use to update as you dictate, not based on only when you can get &nbsp;the IT resources to help.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics For Data And Content Owners On Who Is Using</strong><br /> APIs are not just about getting users access to the data and content they need in their projects, it goes both ways, and can provide a wealth of valuable information to the database administrator, content owner, and data steward who is in charge of the vital government resource. With everyone accessing your resources via an API, you have a realtime pulse on who has access to your resources and rich details on how they are using it. Do you know who is consuming your digital resources today? It is likely you do not, and this new approach using web APIs come with built in tools for truly understanding who has access, while also allowing for access in realtime without demanding extra time and attention, but when you are ready you can audit and understand how these resources are actually being put to use across an agency.</p>
<p><strong>Thinking Beyond Public APIs At Your Agency</strong><br /> Understanding that APIs are much more than just making data available to public developers is extremely important, and can transform how your agency works. Amazon managed to internalize APIs in such a way that changed not just how they do business when it came to online commerce on Amazon.com, but transformed the way we all do business on the Internet. Imagine if a federal agency could see APIs the same, and allow the accessing of internal resources in a similar way, it could entirely change how government services are delivered.</p>
<p>If all digital resources at an agency could be made available via APIs, it has the potential dramatically shift how agencies operate. Right now most agencies already have a wealth of internal web services that somewhat resemble modern web APis, the problem is they are designed by, and deployed for IT and developer stakeholders, not everyone else in the organization. The significant difference between web service and APIs is that APIs use Internet technologies to make data and content available in a very simple way, that if bundled with the right building blocks can make vital resources accessible to anyone across the agency.</p>
<p>IT and developers are fine with just publishing an API and calling it good, as they know how to access these APis without assistance. With just a little more thought, and work, connectors, widgets, and spreadsheet tools can make resources much more widely available across an organization, department and even agency-wide. Undoubtedly it will take a lot of work to shift how IT makes resources available, but there are also tools to help content owners, and data stewards to deploy and consume their own APIs. There are wealth of database, and <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com/">spreadsheet to API solutions</a> available, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/02/everyone-is-about-to-get-an-api-with-the-new-wordpress-api/">content management system (CMS) to API solutions for common platforms like Drupal and Wordpress</a>. Ideally IT gets on board with an API centric vision, but it isn't a requirement in 2014, where waves of web APIs are emerging providing access to the resource you need to solve the problems you face in your everyday world, with or without IT being involved.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Sep 2014</span>

<p>I am working on a white paper for a big enterprise provider who is looking to deliver solutions in the API space. At their request I&rsquo;ve gone through six industries and looked for companies who have over 5k employees and are doing interesting things with APIs--a request that produced some great research for the white paper, as well as for stories here on API Evangelist.</p>
<p>It can be hard to find large enterprise organizations who are doing full blown "API", because honestly many of them just do not get it yet. Sure I can find many that are doing web services, and dabbling with APIs, but it can be downright difficult to find examples of companies that I would showcase as a healthy API patterns.</p>
<p>Doing this research I was looking more for examples of anything &ldquo;API&rdquo; happening, any bare-bones, positive signals that could be emulated, and try and demonstrate what huge opportunities there are in these industries, for anyone who could do it right. I got my first draft ready, and submitted for review, and jumped on a call to discuss.</p>
<p>Everything looked great in the paper, except senior leadership said there was a lack of detail demonstrating how developers were building applications on these enterprise public APIs, They would need more hard examples of how these large company APIs were being used, how this benefited the API provider, and some hard numbers of usage, revenue, showing how business models, products and services were being developed.</p>
<p>After smiling, I told them I could guarantee that most of these providers themselves don't have that detail, and are still working to figure this out. Your request is exactly why we do APIs, and begin to establish an external R&amp;D lab for providing answers, in realtime. Even if some of the more mature providers have this information, I can guarantee they aren't going to share it publicly. Maybe if they were a startup, this type of sharing might be in their DNA, but not the enterprise, sorry.</p>
<p>These types of questions are what I got from government agencies (and still get) two years ago after President Obama mandated that all federal agencies go machine readable by default. They wanted to see the ROI from other agencies doing APIs, before they'd do it too. I wish I had all the answers to make risk averse government agencies, institutions, and enterprise feel warm and fuzzy about APIs, but just like it has taken all of us over two years to get any results in the federal government, and four years for me in the wider API space. It is going to take a lot of hard work before you will see those numbers, and if you require these before you get your feet wet, I can guarantee the numbers will be generated by your competitors before you do.</p>
<p>You have to be a little adventurous, agile, and nimble to operate in this realm. If you aren&rsquo;t, I recommend starting with some of the low hanging, safer fruit in your company, and just get started, because then you can hopefully learn from the API process. Once you begin your journey you start to see cultural benefits of an API-centric focus&mdash;otherwise you can sit back and watch a new wave of startups and your existing competition do it for you.</p>

<p>I used to work hard to write blog posts on API Evangelist that would have broad appeal with the Hacker News community, and at first I didn't have any luck, after trying to engage with readers on posts, I found myself blacklisted, where nothing I submitted showed up. I lived in some kind parallel universe, all because I argued with a couple influential HN users, who didn't like what I had to offer.</p>
<p>I started a new account for API Evangelist, and began playing the game with a little different approach. I didn't engage with users, and wrote posts with titles that would bring in readers, kept things short and superficial, and had some front-page exposure, which would result in thousands of pageviews, and then would dissipate. This type of storytelling ever really turned into meaningful traffic, an engaged audience, conversations, or brought any value to my overall mission.</p>
<p>Early last year I stopped posting to HN, only occasionally posted a story, but never really used it in the same way that I had before. I was worried my traffic would be hurt, but I went back to work, trying to write meaningful posts, that brought value to my target audience, and supported my mission. In the last year and a half, I've seen my sustained monthly traffic go from 500 page views a day to almost 2000 a day, all by just my sticking to my mission.</p>
<p>The audience that does visit my blog, for the most part engages with me, shares posts on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and other channels, and I see much of what I write echoed on other blogs, and in conversations I see on social media, and in person at events. This approach to building my audience, and ultimately traffic to my site has been very healthy in helping me obtain my objectives. My goal is not pageviews for advertising sake, it is to build an awareness in the average business person, and the everyday individual, about the importance of APIs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing this post because see echoes of HN in another blog DZone, which I don&rsquo;t actually syndicate to, but because of the history behind my kin lane.com blog, some of my posts still get hand selected by the DZone staff, and syndicated to the blog. Many of these blog posts get some pretty good comment activity, and the other week a blog post I wrote on Google&rsquo;s hiring process, which got quite a bit of comments, including some pretty trollish ones.</p>
<p>I made the mistake of feeding the trolls, something I don't usually do, but I can&rsquo;t help myself occasionally, and it made me think of this same illness that many advertising driven technology sites possess. I&rsquo;m so happy to have my blog, something I know that reaches a wide range of people, not just because of the page views, but also because of the online and in-person feedback I get. The alpha geek crowd is not my audience, and I don't care what they think about what I&rsquo;m saying, but the trollish comments still get to me sometimes. i quickly shrug them off, but writing about these emotions is one way I do that&mdash;resulting in this post.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stoked to have a mission driven blog, that goes beyond monetization through advertising. My audience may be small compared to DZone or Hacker News, and what I do may not matter to a lot of their users, but at least I have purpose that involves helping educate people, and I don&rsquo;t feel the need to tell people how stupid they are, and that what they do is worthless. I can&rsquo;t imagine being so lost, that doing that makes you feel better. It makes me sad, but then I get back to work, and move on, keeping on with my mission.</p>

<p>In 2014 we are making significant progress in deploying APIs in support of city operations, but we still have so much more work ahead of us when it comes to making public resources available. You can find a dedicated developer area full of data sets, and APIs, in most major US cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and many more, but what else can we do to really pick up the momentum and quality?</p>
<p><strong>Standardizing API Design Practices</strong><br /> APIs are not that difficult to design with the right education, and experience. Developers who work on city contracts, or are employed by the city should all be taught common web API design practices, and be exposed to modern API design tooling like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary</a>. Even with this type of education, there will still be many differences between city deployments based upon needs, and tactics, but a little training could go a long way to make city operations more streamlined.</p>
<p><strong>Open Solutions For API Deployment</strong><br />There are a lot of common approaches to delivering city services, which means there should also a be a number of ways to provide standardized, open solutions for deploying APIs that support city operations. There should be a wealth of open source, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/22/wordpress-style-api-modules-for-government/">Wordpress like solutions for deploying APIs in support of government operations.</a> Sometimes connecting to legacy systems is just to much work, and deploying a simple, standalone solution, then syncing using data dumps or directly with backbend system might be more fruitful.</p>
<p><strong>Common API Management Vision</strong><br />I&rsquo;m pretty impressed with the standard approach to deploying city developer areas, and delivering data sets, and APIs, but in reality this is the result of the hard work of <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a>, one of the API management providers dedicated to the government space. I think Socrata, and the other vendors out there are definitely one piece of the puzzle for managing APIs for city operations, but I also think we need other competing, open solutions similar to <a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella">API Umbrella</a> which is being used across the federal government.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source Tooling Across Cities</strong><br />When it comes to helping cities better serve their citizens, and save money along the way, I can&rsquo;t think of a better place to start than by providing common, open source tools for delivering web, and mobile applications on top of city data and APIs. We have to stop re-inventing the wheel for each city when it comes to developing common apps, city needs are going to be very similar across cities--just take a look at solutions like <a href="http://www.open311.org/">Open311</a>, and the let&rsquo;s get to work on delivering similiar solutions for every part of city operations.</p>
<p>There is no reason each city should have to go at it alone when it comes to designing, deploying, managing, evangelizing, and putting APIs to work across city operations. We should have standard data models, API definitions, and a wealth of open source tools for cities to put to work.</p>
<p>I don't see APIs as the solution for all cities problems, but I do think that APIs should be common practice for <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span></strong> cities. Every city should be publishing all of their data and content in machine readable way, without causing employees any extra work&mdash;it should just be part of normal operations.</p>
<p>In the future, all cities will have standard APIs across all cities, and common open source solutions that can be put to work serving citizens in all aspects of city operations. This is how we are going to empower our cities to more with less, and make governing a more inclusive for everyone.</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

<p>I saw another story about whether or not public APIs are going away, which is another story in a fairly long line of stories I&rsquo;m seeing lately from enterprise outlets about whether or not the demise of Netflix, ESPN, and now Aetna means public APIs are a bad idea, unsustainable and now will be going away&mdash;proving enterprise API architects right that an SOA is the way to go.</p>
<p>If you are looking at the bigger API picture, the answer to this question is clearly no. Amazon, Salesforce, Twilio, and many other public APIs with straightforward business models are doing just fine. Just because a handful of companies who never quite had a business model, and never really gave their API efforts &nbsp;the resources they needed to be successful, doesn't mean that public APIs are a bad idea.</p>
<p>Looking through my list of 2500+ APIs I track on, I can point to numerous other APIs that are about to shutter, which has nothing to do with the fact that they are public, and everything to do with not having the right business and political building blocks for their API. I&rsquo;m sorry if you are just in the game to exploit developers and get them to build things for your company, you can&rsquo;t be exploitative in this game and last, developers smell that shit a mile away--you have to give, just as much as receive.</p>
<p>To be successful when it comes to APIs, you can't just launch an API, spend 100K on a popular API management solution, hire one guy (you know it, you hired a guy), and expect miracles within a couple months. It just doesn't work that way. APIs take a lot more grassroots building of an evangelist team, investment in a lot of projects, telling of many meaningful stories, and going to many conferences, Meetups, and events before anyone will know you exist, let alone building anything on your APIs.</p>
<p>Public APIs being a failure is something the enterprise wants you to believe so they can sell you their SOA solutions disguised as API ones, Public APIs disappearing is more about the business and politics of APIs, and less about the technology and whether something is publicly available or not. If you don't have the company culture to invest in transparency, outreach, and providing meaningful resources that developers will need to be successful, you will fail in the public API game, so give up now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about how the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">open source API search engine APIs.io</a> can be deployed as an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/an-apisjson-collection-of-api-resources-across-your-public-partner-or-internal-resources/">internal API search engine</a>, as well as for public API discovery in the past. One aspect of this approach that I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough, is that the search engine doesn&rsquo;t just return APIs in the search results, it can <a href="http://apisjson.org/2014/07/09/the-power-in-api-discovery-for-apisjson-will-be-in-the-api-url-type/">provide access to supporting building blocks</a> as well.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json format</a> doesn't just provide a machine readable way to describe, and index your APIs, it also provides a way to describe the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks that support your APIs like code samples, SDKs</a>, and other things API consumers will need when putting APIs to work for them.</p>
<p>The indexing of these API support elements really starts to benefit company operations when you also bundle tools for non-developers alongside internal APIs, like spreadsheet connectors, <a href="http://d3.js">d3.js visualizations</a> built on top of APIs, and other elements that any user can reverse engineer, or just put to work immediately--no configuration necessary.</p>
<p>Imagine if your internal staff could access any digital resources across the company, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">similar to what Amazon has done internally</a>, and not just find the API driven resources they need, but also the tools they need to apply them in their jobs. This is where APIs started getting really powerful, allowing anyone at your company to put APIs to work and get their jobs done in a self-service way, with a limited amount of IT resources required.</p>

<p>I get a lot of folks who engage me about the API space, most of them are API providers, many are focused on API consumption, with only just a small few are looking the evangelism and analyst side of things. As far as I know I&rsquo;m the only individual out there looking at all industries, across all of these areas, working hard to understand how APIs are being applied across the board.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always keeping an eye out for talent that is also working to expand their knowledge in the same way, but as the API universe expands I think this is going to be increasingly difficult, and I think we are going to start needing more analysts who focus within specific domains, and business sectors.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I&rsquo;ve been closely watching Mark Silverberg (<a href="https://twitter.com/skram">@skram</a>) over at <a href="http://SocialHealthInsights.com">SocialHealthInsights.com</a>, and is what I&rsquo;d considered to be an API expert when it comes to the convergence of healthcare and APIs.</p>
<p>Mark is always hacking on interesting things related to healthcare, and pushing the envelope when it comes to healthcare APIs, by not just hacking on healthcare APIs, but also developing apps for Google Glass. Mark has developed his expertise in a similar way as I do, by hacking, telling stories, and consulting--which I think is the best way to develop yourself as an API expert.</p>
<p>Earlier this spring the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/">FDA was preparing their new developer area</a>, including the release of a handful of APIs like the drug labeling and adverse effects APis, and a handful of us with DC connections that were on the backchannel, providing feedback for the FDA during this beta period. Unfortunately I was too busy traveling to participate, but Mark was front and center providing some serious feedback on the API, resulting data, and the overall approach by the FDA.</p>
<p>It has taken me four long years to develop my eye for not just the technical, but the business and political approach to delivering APIs, and it is something I&rsquo;ve only lightly touched on when it comes to the healthcare sector. I would say that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mark is this</span>, cultivating a pretty critical eye for what is important when it comes to APIs in the healthcare space. If you are needing any guidance when it comes to planning, designing, deploying, and managing your healthcare APIs I recommend you connect with Mark, he can help you out like nobody else I know&mdash;make sure and tell him I sent you his way.</p>

<p>One question I get pretty frequently from my readers, is about how they should explain APIs to their senior leaders, specifically the non-tech savvy executives. In my opinion, these conversations can be some of the most important ones, not just for a single company, but potentially an entire industry. To help support this effort, I&rsquo;m working through several stories that anyone can put to work when trying to convince their senior leaders that APIs are a thing--this week is about access to resources.</p>
<p>APIs are all about making vital company resources available in a self-service, and secure way over the open Internet. Despite popular belief, most APIs are not publicly available, just the overview, documentation, code samples, and other building blocks are publicly available. If a developer actually wants to use an API they have to register, and be given access to API endpoints, before they can do anything with them. There are some pretty&nbsp;<a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">proven approaches to API management</a>&nbsp;out there, which include a centrally located developer center, simple API registration form, and potentially multiple service levels, that all help manage how APIs are accessed and put to use.</p>
<p>API resources can be anything from a company directory, to details of specific projects, or possible access to company compute, storage and other common IT resources. Anything you do on your computer at work, or have published via your website, can be made available via APIs, and easily accessed through a public or private portal, in a 24/7, self-service manner--all without needing to make a request for IT resources. This type of efficiency is what every company needs to be competitive in coming years, ensuring that every employee has access to the resources they need to get their job done.</p>
<p>Access to corporate or organization resources via APIs doesn&rsquo;t have to be something just for programmers. It is pretty likely that you already have web services at your company, but these APIs have been designed just for IT and geeks, where modern APIs come with supporting building blocks like widgets, spreadsheet connectors, and other tools that make API resources accessible and usable by anyone. This is an important distinction, one that is democratizing vital resources, and putting them into the  hands of people who can benefit the most, and not restricted by classic IT bottlenecks.</p>
<p>IT, and developers will often say APIs aren&rsquo;t for the average business person, and many business folks are used to this type of rhetoric and have been trained to avoid anything API related, feeling this isn&rsquo;t for them&mdash;something tech folks like, because it keeps them in control, feeding into classic IT power structures. However, for the last 14 years, web APIs have been making vital resources available to internal and external developers who are building web and mobile applications, as well as the internal power user, and are something every company should consider, when looking to help everyone in a company do their job better.</p>

<p>When I think about the concept "API mashup", It conjures up visions of clever hacks using Twitter and Google Maps from 2008 or 2009, where savvy developers would find innovative ways to mashup two or more APIs, and deliver some sort of web, and eventually mobile application on top of a couple of common APIs.</p>
<p>In 2014 I think the concept of a mashup has evolved, and while the term has fallen out of popularity with some people, I think the topic is still extremely relevant, and is something I want to discuss more at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">@APIStrat in Chicago</a> at the end of this month. To continue this discussion we've asked four leaders from the world of APIs to join me on stage for a panel discussion we are calling &ldquo;The Next Generation API Stack&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issac Roth (<a href="https://twitter.com/ijroth">@ijroth</a>) of&nbsp;<a href="http://strongloop.com/">StrongLoop</a></li>
<li>Kyle Wild (<a href="https://twitter.com/dorkitude">@dorkitude</a>) of&nbsp;<a href="https://keen.io/">Keen.io</a></li>
<li>Antony Falco (<a href="https://twitter.com/antonyfalco">@antonyfalco</a>) of&nbsp;<a href="http://orchestrate.io/">Orchestrate.io</a></li>
<li>Mehdi Medjaoui (<a href="https://twitter.com/medjawii">@medjawii</a>) of&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/OAuth_io">oAuth.io</a></li>
<li>Justin Karneges (<a href="https://twitter.com/jkarneges">@jkarneges</a>) of <a href="https://fanout.io/">Fanout.io</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I want to discuss the concept of &ldquo;mashup&rdquo; which I think historically has represented what we do in the world of APIs, but is a term that has significantly moved on for experienced API developers.  I&rsquo;m looking to discuss this from a client side perspective, but also from the API provider, API aggregator, and analystics perspective as well. When you look at what innovators like StrongLoop, Keen.io, Orchestrate, and Webshell are doing, it is much more than just mashing up two APIs and building a web app.</p>
<p>Today's tools allow you to quickly mashup multiple APIs into new API stacks, bringing together your own resources, as well as those of other API providers, and deliver an intelligent stack of resources that any web, mobile, or Itnernet of things developer can use to build apps. Another thing that has evolved is the number of APIs being used, based only upon my own usage, my apps have gone using 2-3 APIs in 2009, to using potentially 20-30 APIs in a single app&mdash;dramatically upping the stakes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still pulling together the topics and questions I&rsquo;ll be bringing up with Issac, Kyle, Antony, and Mehdi during The Next Generation API Stack panel at APIStrat, so if there is any topic you&rsquo;d like to discuss, please let me know, and I&rsquo;ll consider adding to the list. I&rsquo;ll see you in Chicago in a couple of weeks--<a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/register.php">make sure and get registered ASAP</a>!</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/tech-business-politics-03-2014.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>There was a very interesting piece from venture capitalist Albert Wenger (<a href="https://twitter.com/albertwenger">@albertwenger</a>) of <a href="http://www.usv.com/">Union Square Ventures</a> over the labor day weekend, called <a href="http://continuations.com/post/96355016855/labor-day-right-to-an-api-key-algorithmic-organizing">Labor Day: Right to an API Key (Algorithmic Organizing)</a>,&nbsp;that I&rsquo;ve had open ever since and wanted to take a moment to add my thoughts to. First let me say, I agree 100% with Albert&rsquo;s post, but I felt that the piece left out some very critical elements, which I think Albert simply left out because he was just trying to get a short thought published over a holiday weekend, but I feel pretty strongly these points are critical to his argument, and should be put out there.</p>
<p>You can read the <a href="http://continuations.com/post/96355016855/labor-day-right-to-an-api-key-algorithmic-organizing">full post over on Albert's blog</a>, but I think this statement sums it up nicely:</p>
<blockquote><em>There is a simple and universal regulatory change that would dramatically shift the bargaining power: an individual right to an API Key. By this I mean a key that would give an enduser *full* read/write access to the system including every action or screen the enduser can take or see on the web site or application. Alternatively one could think of this as an individual right to be represented by an algorithm.</em></blockquote>
<p>Shortly after Albert published his post, his partner Fred Wilson (<a href="https://twitter.com/fredwilson">@fredwilson</a>) chimed in with his own post, called <a href="http://avc.com/2014/09/algorithmic-organizing/">Algorithmic Organizing</a>,&nbsp;and again I took just single paragraph that I think sums it up:</p>
<blockquote><em>I believe that in the long run these platforms may/will be replaced by blockchain based networks of labor where there is no platform middleman and there would be no need for a legal right to an API because all the data would be public by default.</em></blockquote>
<p>I agree with what both Albert and Fred are saying, and it makes me happy to see such prominent VC firms seeing the future in this way. What I wish to add to this conversation is some critical thought around the the business and political building blocks that often times don't get discussed in these conversations, but are actually the real reason this vision can work, but at the same time are why this vision could also become more dangerous than the one we currently have.</p>
<p>The dangerous part I refer to, is the blind faith that the algorithm can represent us, providing some neutral, pure extension of ourselves, free of the power structures that perpetuate much of the divide between the haves and have nots that we see in the physical world. I believe that APIs have all the potential to deliver a better future, but the API, and the keys, are just two variables in the algorithm in which they Albert and Fred speak of, when in reality there are numerous other variables at play that need to be discussed as well, or we will find ourselves in the same situations we currently are, but a potentially more dangerous world where the algorithm obfuscates any exploitation that is happening, and protects the perpetrator.</p>
<p><strong>Passive Aggressive API Rate Limiting</strong> <br />The easiest way to limit the power any developer or end-user that is given by an API, is rate limiting. Rate limits can be established to restrict what you can access by the second, minute, hour, day, or any other configuration, making it pretty near impossible to realize any power or control you may think you have been given by a service. Most API providers are transparent with their rate limiting, and publish simple explanations of what they limit, and why, acknowledging the real world need to reduce overhead in API operations, and provide a certain quality of service for everyone. The problem with rate limiting comes in when platforms are not clear about their motivations for rate limiting, what the limitations are, and the actual rate limits to do reflect what is published publicly.</p>
<p><strong>Hiding Motives Behind API Error Handling </strong><br />Error handling on API requests are great way to limit actual access to any API resource, allowing the API provider to hide behind errors in the system, when in reality they are purposefully working to limit what you can actually do with the API. Errors can be generated per user, application or for entire groups, making it almost impossible to hold platforms accountable when it comes to making resources truly accessible. I&rsquo;m not saying this is a common practice for  API providers, I&rsquo;m just saying that it is technically feasible, and I am pretty damn sure I&rsquo;ve seen it in the wild, making it a real concern for me. Even if it occurs due to incompetency, it is still preventing you from being truly accessing any resources, and making the truly algorithm represent you.</p>
<p><strong>Service Stability Can Bring Down Any Vision </strong><br />Building on the API error handling described above, overall service stability is a common way that API driven resources can be also rendered useless. Sure a company has an API, and you have an API key to access resources made available via that API, but if you can&rsquo;t actually connect to the API in a reliable way, what does it matter? There are a number of reasons service stability can be unreliable, it can be due a lack or resources, incompetence, or it can be intentional&mdash;as a recovering IT director, I can guarantee I&rsquo;ve seen this in action. I don&rsquo;t care how open your API is, if it isn't reliable it will not provide any value to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Security Needs To Be Priority </strong><br />An open, publicly available API might be great for you to gain access to your online resources, and the assets of any company, organization, or government agency, but the same can instantly be used against you if security is not given top priority. Security is not a reason to avoid APIs, just like websites, and other systems, APIs can be secured, but if it is not done right, and systems are not properly monitored, any API can be breached, going from APIs being a good thing, to APIs being the worst thing on earth&mdash;demonstrating pretty clearly this is more than just about the technology of APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Terms of Service Rule Everything </strong><br />The Terms of Service (TOS) provide a legal framework for developers, and end-users to operate within, set forth by a platform. TOS should protect the API owners company, assets and brand, but should also provide assurances for developers who are building businesses on top of an API, and ultimately how end-users can make a system work for them. If the TOS are out of balance, no amount of API access will matter if you are legally compromised in what you can actually do with resources.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency in Partner Tiers Of Access</strong><br />One of the benefits of modern approaches to APIs is the ability to compose different sets of services, and multiple access levels for different partners. Partner access is a great way to incentivize development on top of any platform, and give higher levels of access to those who contribute to the value of a platform.  Where this model begins to break down is when there is a lack of transparency, and platforms do not share information about what levels of access actually exist, which basically brings us back to the good ol boy networks we currently see across virtually any industry.</p>
<p><strong>Paying Attention To Privacy </strong><br />Privacy policies also protect the interests of partners, developers and platform users, while also protecting the API owner from damaging activity on their platform. Like an API terms of service, privacy policies need to strike a balance that protects everyone involved, while also allowing for innovation and commercial activity. APIs can very technically sound, but if the privacy of end-users are not respected, an API can become a liability for everyone involved. Privacy is another area that we will see increasingly become a problem in the future, preventing many from seeing APIs as a good thing, but if done right we can make sure APIs reflect the vision Albert and Fred speak of.</p>
<p><strong>Who Owns The Information I Pull Via An API </strong><br />Content and data ownership is an extremely contentious topic right now, with platforms claiming they own content that is generated using their services, and end-users rightfully feeling they have a stake in ownership of the content, data, media, and other information they generate on the platform. What good is API access, if I have no ownership of the content we generate via the platform? Sure I can access valuable resources, but if I can&rsquo;t legally do anything with it, what value is created by the API and its underlying algorithm?</p>
<p><strong>The Deprecation Of Any API Led Vision </strong><br />An API deprecation policy sets expectations with API consumers about when and how API resources will be shut down. These policies help build trust with API developers and end-users, giving them an idea of how long they can depend on an API resource, and what they can expect when an API reaches the end of life. You may have access to data and content that a platform contains, complete with API access, but if that service can go away at any point after an acquisition, or due to lack or resources or leadership, and you do not have any sort of heads up, an API is immediately rendered meaningless in this wider discussion.</p>
<p><strong>The Power of Industry Influence </strong><br />As I watch the enterprise and government take notice of the API space, I&rsquo;m seeing some pretty clear examples of industry influence over the value brought to the table by APIs. I do not care how open, transparent, and technically sound your API is, and you can follow every bit of my advice, but if the 1000 lb gorilla in any industry is not happy with a service, an API will be no defense against acquisition, shutdown, or their legal attack. If a large corporate or government entity doesn't like your platform, they can shut you down, even if it is just through a sustained legal attack. This is one of my biggest concerns about VC investment in seemingly open, and altruistic APIs driven platforms, is that your investors always provide a doorway for industry influence to change the course of your API, no matter what you might believe as the platform owner.</p>
<p><strong>The Smoke And Mirrors Of "Open"<br /></strong>One of the most used terms in the world of APIs is &ldquo;open", and at the same time is also one of the most abused terms I know of. All of the reasons listed above can affect how truly open any API, platform and company is, preventing Albert and Fred&rsquo;s vision from ever becoming a reality. I could list another 50 ways that API providers prevent &nbsp;access to content and resources via APIs, ranging from lack of communication to complex pricing. My goal with this post is to show that there are some very real ways in which APIs can be used against the average worker and citizen, and that APIs are not good, bad, nor neutral&mdash;just like algorithms. They just reflect the intentions of their creators, and while I think there are many opportunities to make sure they reflect us, the end-user, citizen and worker, I think more often than not, they reflect the desires of their owners.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter As The Perpetual Poster Child </strong><br />I really love Twitter, and I think the platform is amazing. The company has made some very serious effot to improve problems on their API platform, but they still are the best example I can use to demonstrate how every one of these variables listed can be used against the access and freedom an API could provides, without you even knowing it. When it comes to demonstrating the power that APIs bring to the table, and the democratization of our digital resources, Twitter is a shining example. When it comes to demonstrating how an API can be leveraged against its users, and algorithmic organizing can just as easily be used against us, Twitter is a shining example. Search across the API Evangelist network and you will see I&rsquo;m both a lover and critic of Twitter, and I do not believe Dick Costolo is Mr. Smithers plotting and scheming how Twitter can screw us all over, but I do think at scale, after you&rsquo;ve taken a certain amount of funding, and you become interesting to the powers that be&mdash;things change, and an API, and the algorithms behind can be used in very harmful ways.</p>
<p><strong>Algorithmic Transparency </strong><br />It is easy to get excited about the potential around APIs and algorithms. I don't have a problem with this, more power to you (pun intended), however I personally feel algorithmic solutionism, and API solutionism for that matter, is not healthy. The way forward involves transparency, and communication around some of the very difficult areas I&rsquo;ve listed. Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile</a>) wrote a great post at TechRepublic earlier this year, called <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/data-driven-policy-and-commerce-requires-algorithmic-transparency/">data-driven policy and commerce requires algorithmic transparency</a>, which I think sums up this concept very nicely. For all of this to work, there has to be enough sunlight to keep things disinfected or we are going to see many of the same problem we see in the physical world, as well as a whole bunch of new problem we&rsquo;ve never anticipated.</p>
<p><strong>Algorithmic Accountability </strong><br />Additionally, I don&rsquo;t feel that even algorithmic transparency will be enough, we have to make sure companies, organizations, institutions, government agencies, and individuals are held accountable for their actions. If there is no way to hold companies accountable for their violations in the ways discussed above, what does an open, transparent API or algorithm even matter? It doesn&rsquo;t mean anything, and it doesn&rsquo;t give us any balance, it just transfers the same power structures we&rsquo;ve known in the physical world to the virtual world, but now things are even more difficult to understand or hold any individual or company accountable for their malicious activity.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, I totally agree with Albert Wenger and Fred Wilson on their labor day API thoughts. I feel that every company, organization, institution, government agency, and even many individuals should have APIs, and that they are the key to a better future. However I think many of these entities will also omit very important detail from API discussions, similar to each of Albert and Fred&rsquo;s posts. I do not believe they did it intentionally, or have any ill intent, but I think in our obsession with technology, algorithms, and APIs, we can miss a lot, and this is what many companies will count on, and use to their advantage.</p>
<p>If we do not pay attention to how the technological, business, and political building blocks are being used for exploitation, and manipulation, we are creating an even more dangerous divide between the haves and have nots, while opening up serious opportunities for abuse by the ruling merchant class, and further erode the rights we enjoy as workers, not moving them in a more positive direction. The real scary part for me, is that you probably won&rsquo;t ever even notice that any of this exploitation is evn occurring, and it will be very difficult to hold anyone accountable, all because of the magic of the algorithm and APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-knowledge-transfer.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>One question I get pretty frequently from my readers, is how should they explain APIs to senior leaders, specifically the executives who aren't tech savvy. In my opinion, these conversations can be some of the most important ones for not just a specific company, but potentially an entire industry&mdash;so I wanted to provide some material you can use in your own conversations.</p>
<p>First APIs are just like websites, but instead of being for humans they are meant for other desktop, web, server, and mobile applications. When you go to twitter.com you get an HTML listing of tweets, and when you go to api.twitter.com you get back JSON which is meant for other application to read, where the HTML is meant to make visible for the human API--that is it, that is the difference.</p>
<p>I use Twitter in this example, but APIs can be used to deliver any data, content, or even programmatic resource like say an image resize or convert a Word document to a PDF file. APIs act just like web or mobile applications, and let you read, update, add, or delete any of these resources that have been made available via an API.</p>
<p>When having this conversation, make sure and remind your leadership of the years between 1995 and 2000, when we were trying to convince our leadership that we should have websites. Remember all that selling we had to do to convince leadership that our company should have a website? Is there any question about whether or not your company should have a website in 2014? NO! This is the same thing that is going on with APIs between 2010 and 2015, and by 2015 to 2020, if your company doesn't have an API you will be at a serioius disadvantage.</p>
<p>To get started, any data or content that you have on your website should be available via an API. This helps you easily make things like company directory, product and service listings, and a blog accessible to be on any mobile application, website, or any server or desktop application. APIs are not about the next crazy software trend, it uses the same technology as delivering your website, but instead of launching a single site, your valuable resources are now instantly available for integration with any website and mobile application.</p>
<p>I have about ten separate examples like this to help you have conversation with your leadership about APIs. My goal is to try and keep them short, concise and something you can easily use to help convince your company that an API centric approach is right for your business. If you have specific scenarios you&rsquo;d like to address, feel free to ping me and let me know.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Sep 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://familysearch.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/250px-FamilySearch_logo.svg.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In my work everyday as the API Evangelist, I get to have some very interesting conversations, with a wide variety of folks, about how they are using APIs, as well as brainstorming other ways they can approach their API strategy allowing them to be more effective. One of the things that keep me going in this space is this diversity. One day I&rsquo;m looking at <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/14/swagger-apisjson-and-review-for-the-new-developertradegov/">Developer.Trade.Gov for the Department of Commerce</a>, the next talking to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/02/everyone-is-about-to-get-an-api-with-the-new-wordpress-api/">WordPress about APIs for 60 million websites</a>, and then I&rsquo;m talking with the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints about the Family Search API, which is actively gathering, preserving, and sharing genealogical records from around the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so lucky I get to speak with all of these folks about the benefits, and perils of APIs, helping them think through their approach to opening up their valuable resources using APIs. The process is nourishing for me because I get to speak to such a diverse number of implementations, push my understanding of what is possible with APIs, while also sharpening my critical eye, understanding of where APIs can help, or where they can possibly go wrong. Personally, I find a couple of things very intriguing about the Family Search API story:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mapping the worlds genealogical history using a publicly available API &mdash; Going Big!!</li>
<li>Potential from participation by not just big partners, but the long tail of genealogical geeks</li>
<li>Transparency, openness, and collaboration shining through as the solution beyond just the technology</li>
<li>The mission driven focus of the API overlapping with my obsession for API evangelism intrigues and scares me</li>
<li>Have existing developer area, APIs, and seemingly necessary building blocks but failed to achieve a platform level</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m open to talking with anyone about their startup, SMB, enterprise, organizational, institutional, or government API, always leaving open a 15 minute slot to hear a good story, which turned into more than an hour of discussion with the Family Search team. See, Family Search already has an API, they have the technology in order, and they even have many of the essential business building blocks as well, but where they are falling short is when it comes to dialing in both the business and politics of their developer ecosystem to discover the right balance that will help them truly become a platform&mdash;which is my specialty. ;-)</p>
<p>This brings us to the million dollar question: <em><strong>How does one become a platform?</strong></em></p>
<p>All of this makes Family Search an interesting API story. The scope of the API, and to take something this big to the next level, Family Search has to become a platform, and not a superficial &ldquo;platform&rdquo; where they are just catering to three partners, but nourishing a vibrant long tail ecosystem of website, web application, single page application, mobile applications, and widget developers. Family Search is at an important reflection point, they have all the parts and pieces of a platform, they just have to figure out exactly what changes need to be made to open up, and take things to the next level.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s quantify the company, what is FamilySearch? &ldquo; For over 100 years, FamilySearch has been actively gathering, preserving, and sharing genealogical records worldwide&rdquo;, believing that &ldquo;learning about our ancestors helps us better understand who we are&mdash;creating a family bond, linking the present to the past, and building a bridge to the future&rdquo;.</p>
<p>FamilySearch is 1.2 billion total records, with 108 million completed in 2014 so far, with 24 million awaiting, as well as 386 active genealogical projects going on. Family Search provides the ability to manage photos, stories, documents, people, and albums&mdash;allowing people to be organized into a tree, knowing the branch everyone belongs to in the global family tree.</p>
<p>FamilySearch, started out as the Genealogical Society of Utah, which was founded in 1894, and dedicate preserving the records of the family of mankind, looking to "help people connect with their ancestors through easy access to historical records&rdquo;. FamilySearch is a mission-driven, non-profit organization, ran by the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. All of this comes together to define an entity, that possesses an image that will appeal to some, while leave concern for others&mdash;making for a pretty unique formula for an API driven platform, that doesn&rsquo;t quite have a model anywhere else.</p>
<p>FamilySearch consider what they deliver as as a set of record custodian services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Image Capture -</strong> Obtaining a preservation quality image is often the most costly and time-consuming step for records custodians. Microfilm has been the standard, but digital is emerging. Whether you opt to do it yourself or use one of our worldwide camera teams, we can help.</li>
<li><strong>Online Indexing -</strong> Once an image is digitized, key data needs to be transcribed in order to produce a searchable index that patrons around the world can access. Our online indexing application harnesses volunteers from around the world to quickly and accurately create indexes.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Conversion -</strong> For those records custodians who already have a substantial collection of microfilm, we can help digitize those images and even provide digital image storage.</li>
<li><strong>Online Access -</strong> Whether your goal is to make your records freely available to the public or to help supplement your budget needs, we can help you get your records online. To minimize your costs and increase access for your users, we can host your indexes and records on <a href="http://familysearch.org/">FamilySearch.org</a>, or we can provide tools and expertise that enable you to create your own hosted access.</li>
<li><strong>Preservation -</strong> Preservation copies of microfilm, microfiche, and digital records from over 100 countries and spanning hundreds of years are safely stored in the Granite Mountain Records Vault&mdash;a long-term storage facility designed for preservation.</li>
</ul>
<p>FamilySearch provides a proven set of services that users can take advantage of via a web applications, as well as iPhone and Android mobile apps, resulting in the online community they have built today. FamilySearch also goes beyond their basic web and mobile application services, and is elevated to software as a service (SaaS) level by having a pretty robust developer center and API stack.</p>
<p><strong>Developer Center<br /></strong>FamilySearch provides the required first impression when you land in the <a href="https://familysearch.org/developers/">FamilySearch developer center</a>, quickly explaining what you can do with the API, "FamilySearch offers developers a way to integrate web, desktop, and mobile apps with its collaborative Family Tree and vast digital archive of records&rdquo;, and immediately provides you with a getting started guide, and other supporting tutorials.</p>
<p>FamilySearch provides access to over 100 API resources in the twenty separate groups: Authorities, Change History, Discovery, Discussions, Memories, Notes, Ordinances, Parents and Children, Pedigree, Person, Places, Records, Search and Match, Source Box, Sources, Spouses, User, Utilities, Vocabularies, connecting you to the core FamilySearch  genealogical engine.</p>
<p>The FamilySearch developer area provides all the common, and even some forward leaning technical building blocks:</p>

<p>Setting the stage for FamilySearch evolving to being a platform, they even posses some necessary partner level building blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://familysearch.org/developers/docs/certification">Certification</a></li>
<li><a href="https://familysearch.org/developers/partnering">Partner Tier</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is even an application gallery showcasing what web, mac &amp; windows desktop, and mobile applications developers have built. FamilySearch even encourages developers to &ldquo;donate your software skills by participating in community projects and collaborating through the FamilySearch Developer Network&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Many of the ingredients of a platform exist within the current FamilySearch developer hub, at least the technical elements, and some of the common business, and political building blocks of a platform, but what is missing? This is what makes FamilySearch a compelling story, because it emphasizes one of the core elements of API Evangelist&mdash;that all of this API stuff only works when the right blend of technical, business, and politics exists.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing A Rich Partnership Environment </strong></p>
<p>FamilySearch has some strong partnerships, that have helped establish FamilySearch as the genealogy service it is today. FamilySearch knows they wouldn&rsquo;t exist without the partnerships they&rsquo;ve established, but how do you take it to the next and grow to a much larger, organic API driven ecosystem where a long tail of genealogy businesses, professionals, and enthusiasts can build on, and contribute to, the FamilySearch platform.</p>
<p>FamilySearch knows the time has come to make a shift to being an open platform, but is not entirely sure what needs to happen to actually stimulate not just the core FamilySearch partners, but also establish a vibrant long tail of developers. A developer portal is not just a place where geeky coders come to find what they need, it is a hub where business development occurs at all levels, in both synchronous, and asynchronous ways, in a 24/7 global environment.</p>
<p>FamilySearch acknowledge they have some issues when it comes investing in API driven partnerships:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Platform&rdquo; means their core set of large partners</li>
<li>Not treating all partners like first class citizens</li>
<li>Competing with some of their partners</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use their own API, creating a gap in perspective</li>
</ul>
<p>FamilySearch knows if they can work out the right configuration, they can evolve FamilySearch from a digital genealogical web and mobile service to a genealogical platform. If they do this they can scale beyond what they&rsquo;ve been able to do with a core set of partners, and crowdsource the mapping of the global family tree, allowing individuals to map their own family trees, while also contributing to the larger global tree. With a proper API driven platform this process doesn&rsquo;t have to occur via the FamiliySearch website and mobile app, it can happen in any web, desktop, or mobile application anywhere.</p>
<p>FamilySearch already has a pretty solid development team taking care of the tech of the FamilySearch API, and they have 20 people working internally to support partners. They have a handle on the tech of their API, they just need to get a handle on the business and politics of their API, and invest in the resources that needed to help scale the FamilySearch API being just a developer area, to being a growing genealogical developer community, to a full blow ecosystem that span not just the FamilySearch developer portal, but thousands of other sites and applications around the globe.</p>
<p><strong>A Good Dose Of API Evangelism To Shift Culture A Bit</strong></p>
<p>A healthy API evangelism strategy brings together a mix of business, marketing, sales and technology disciplines into a new approach to doing business for FamilySearch, something that if done right, can open up FamilySearch to outside ideas, and with the right framework manage to allow the platform to move beyond just certification, and partnering to also investment, and acquisition of data, content, talent, applications, and partners via the FamilySearch developer platform.</p>
<p>Think of evangelism as the grease in the gears of the platform allowing it to grow, expand, and handle a larger volume, of outreach, and support. API evangelism works to lubricate all aspects of platform operation.</p>
<p>First, lets kick off with setting some <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">objectives</span></strong> for why we are doing this, what are we trying to accomplish:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increase Number of Records - </strong>Increase the number of overall records in the FamilySearch database, contributing the larger goals of mapping the global family tree.</li>
<li><strong>Growth in New Users -</strong> Growing the number of new users who are building on the FamilySearch API, increase the overall headcount fro the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Growth In Active Apps -</strong> Increase not just new users but the number of actual apps being built and used, not just counting people kicking the tires.</li>
<li><strong>Growth in Existing User API Usage -</strong> Increase how existing users are putting the FamilySearch APIs. Educate about new features, increase adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Brand Awareness -</strong> One of the top reasons for designing, deploying and managing an active APIs is increase awareness of the FamilySearch brand.</li>
<li>What else?</li>
</ul>
<p>What does <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>developer engagement</strong></span> look like for the FamilySearch platform?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active User Engagement - </strong>How do we reach out to existing, active users and find out what they need, and how do we profile them and continue to understand who they are and what they need. Is there a direct line to the CRM?</li>
<li><strong>Fresh Engagement - </strong>How is FamilySearch contacting new developers who have registered weekly to see what their immediate needs are, while their registration is fresh in their minds.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Engagement -</strong> How are historical active and / or inactive developers being engaged to better understand what their needs are and would make them active or increase activity.</li>
<li><strong>Social Engagement -</strong> Is FamilySearch profiling the  URL, Twitter, Facebook LinkedIn, and Github profiles, and then actively engage via these active channels?</li>
</ul>
<p>Establish a Developer Focused <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blog For Storytelling</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Projects - </strong>There are over 390 active projects on the FamilySearch platform, plus any number of active web, desktop, and mobile applications. All of this activity should be regularly profiled as part of platform evangelism. An editorial assembly line of technical projects that can feed blog stories, how-tos, samples and Github code libraries should be taking place, establishing a large volume of exhaust via the FamlySearch platform.</li>
<li><strong>Stories -</strong> FamilySearch is great at writing public, and partner facing content, but there is a need to be writing, editing and posting of stories derived from the technically focused projects, with SEO and API support by design.</li>
<li><strong>Syndication -</strong> Syndication to Tumblr, Blogger, Medium and other relevant blogging sites on regular basis with the best of the content.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Storytelling - </strong>Telling stories of an API isn&rsquo;t just something you do externally, what stories need to be told internally to make sure an API initiative is successful.</li>
<li><strong>Conversations - </strong>Incite internal conversations about the FamilySearch platform. Hold brown bag lunches if you need to, or internal hackathons to get them involved.</li>
<li><strong>Participation -</strong> It is very healthy to include other people from across the company in API operations. How can we include people from other teams in API evangelism efforts.  Bring them to events, conferences and potentially expose them to local, platform focused events.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting -</strong> Sometimes providing regular numbers and reports to key players internally can help keep operations running smooth. What reports can we produce? Make them meaningful.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this evangelism starts with a very external focus, which is a hallmark of API and developer evangelism efforts, but if you notice by the end we are bringing it home to the most important aspect of platform evangelism, the internal outreach. This is the number one reason APIs fail, is due to a lack of internal evangelism, educating top and mid-level management, as well as lower level staff, getting buy-in and direct hands-on involvement with the platform, and failing to justify budget costs for the resources needed to make a platform successful.</p>
<p><strong>Top-Down Change At FamilySearch</strong></p>
<p>The change FamilySearch is looking for already has top level management buy-in, the problem is that the vision is not in lock step sync with actual platform operations. When regular projects developed via the FamilySearch platform are regularly showcased to top level executives, and stories consistent with platform operations are told, management will echo what is actually happening via the FamilySearch. This will provide a much more ongoing, deeper message for the rest of the company, and partners around what the priorities of the platform are, making it not just a meaningless top down mandate.</p>
<p>An example of this in action is with the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barack-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">recent mandate from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">President Obama</span>, that all federal agencies should go &ldquo;machine readable by default&rdquo;</a>, which includes using APIs and open data outputs like JSON, instead of document formats like PDF. This top down mandate makes for a good PR soundbite, but in reality has little affect on the ground at federal agencies. In reality it has taken two years of hard work on the ground, at each agency, between agencies, and with the public to even begin to make this mandate a truth at over 20 of the federal government agencies.</p>
<p>Top down change is a piece of the overall platform evolution at FamilySearch, but is only a piece. Without proper bottom-up, and outside-in change, FamilySearch will never evolve beyond just being a genealogical software as a service with an interesting API. It takes much more than leadership to make a platform.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom-Up Change At FamilySearch</strong></p>
<p>One of the most influential aspects of APIs I have seen at companies, institutions, and agencies is the change of culture brought when APIs move beyond just a technical IT effort, and become about making resources available across an organization, and enabling people to do their job better. Without an awareness, buy-in, and in some cases evangelist conversion, a large organization will not be able to move from a service orientation to a platform way of thinking.</p>
<p>If a company as a whole is unaware of APIs, either at the company or organization, as well as out in the larger world with popular platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and others&mdash;it is extremely unlikely they will endorse, let alone participate in moving from being a digital service to platform. Employees need to see the benefits of a platform to their everyday job, and their involvement cannot require what they would perceive as extra work to accomplish platform related duties. FamilySearch employees need to see the benefits the platform brings to the overall mission, and play a role in this happening&mdash;even if it originates from a top-down mandate.</p>
<p>Top bookseller <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amazon</span> was already on the path to being a platform with their set of commerce APIs, when after a top down mandate from CEO Jeff Bezos, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">Amazon internalized APIs in such a way, that the entire company interacted, and exchange resources using web APIs</a>, resulting in one of the most successful API platforms&mdash;Amazon Web Services (AWS). Bezos mandated that if an Amazon department needed to procure a resource from another department, like server or storage space from IT, it need to happen via APIs. This wasn&rsquo;t a meaningless top-down mandate, it made employees life easier, and ultimately made the entire company more nimble, and agile, while also saving time and money. Without buy-in, and execution from Amazon employees, what we know as the cloud would never have occurred.</p>
<p>Change at large enterprises, organizations, institutions and agencies, can be expedited with the right top-down leadership, but without the right platform evangelism strategy, that includes internal stakeholders as not just targets of outreach efforts, but also inclusion in operations, it can result in sweeping, transformational changes. This type of change at a single organization can effect how an entire industry operates, similar to what we&rsquo;ve seen from the ultimate API platform pioneer, Amazon.</p>
<p><strong>Outside-In Change At FamilySearch</strong></p>
<p>The final layer of change that needs to occur to bring FamilySearch from being just a service to a true platform, is opening up the channels to outside influence when it comes not just to platform operations, but organizational operations as well. The bar is high at FamilySearch. The quality of services, and expectation of the process, and adherence to the mission is strong, but if you are truly dedicated to providing a database of all mankind, you are going to have to let mankind in a little bit.</p>
<p>FamilySearch is still the keeper of knowledge, but to become a platform you have to let in the possibility that outside ideas, process, and applications can bring value to the organization, as well as to the wider genealogical community. You have to evolve beyond notions that the best ideas from inside the organization, and just from the leading partners in the space. There are opportunities for innovation and transformation in the long-tail stream, but you have to have a platform setup to encourage, participate in, and be able to identify value in the long-tail stream of an API platform.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Twitter</span> is one of the best examples of how any platform will have to let in outside ideas, applications, companies, and individuals. Much of what we consider as Twitter today was built in the platform ecosystem from the iPhone and Android apps, to the desktop app TweetDeck, to terminology like the #hashtag. Over the last 5 years, Twitter has worked hard to find the optimal platform balance, regarding how they educate, communicate, invest, acquire, and incentives their platform ecosystem. Listening to outside ideas goes well beyond the fact that Twitter is a publicly available social platform, it is about having such a large platform of API developers, and it is impossible to let in all ideas, but through a sophisticated evangelism strategy of in-person, and online channels, in 2014 Twitter has managed to find a balance that is working well.</p>
<p>Having a public facing platform doesn&rsquo;t mean the flood gates are open for ideas, and thoughts to just flow in, this is where service composition, and the certification and partner framework for FamilySearch will come in. Through clear, transparent partners tiers, open and transparent operations and communications, an optimal flow of outside ideas, applications, companies and individuals can be established&mdash;enabling a healthy, sustainable amount of change from the outside world.</p>
<p><strong>Knowing All Of Your Platform Partners</strong></p>
<p>The hallmark of any mature online platform is a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/03/taking-a-quick-look-at-the-leading-api-partner-programs/">well established partner ecosystem</a>.&nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve made the transition from service to platform, you&rsquo;ve established a pretty robust approach to not just certifying, and on boarding your partners, you also have stepped it up in knowing and understanding who they are, what their needs are, and investing in them throughout the lifecycle.</p>
<p>First off, profile everyone who comes through the front door of the platform. If they sign up for a public API key, who are they, and where do they potentially fit into your overall strategy. Don&rsquo;t be pushy, but understanding who they are and what they might be looking for, and make sure you have a track for this type of user well defined.</p>
<p>Next, quality, and certify as you have been doing. Make sure the process is well documented, but also transparent, allowing companies and individuals to quickly understand what it will take to certified, what the benefits are, and examples of other partners who have achieved this status. As a developer, building a genealogical mobile app, I need to know what I can expect, and have some incentive for investing in the certification process.</p>
<p>Keep your friends close, and your competition closer. Open the door wide for your competition to become a platform user, and potentially partner. 100+ year old technology company <a href="http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/">Johnson Controls&nbsp;(JCI)</a> was concerned about what the competition might do it they <a href="https://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix-developer-center)">opened up their building efficient data resources to the public via the Panoptix API platform</a>, when after it was launched, they realized their competition were now their customer, and a partner in this new approach to doing business online for JCI.</p>
<p>When Department of Energy decides what data and other resource it makes available via Data.gov or the agencies developer program it has to deeply consider how this could affect U.S. industries. The resources the federal agency possesses can be pretty high value, and huge benefits for the private sector, but in some cases how might opening up APIs, or limiting access to APIs help or hurt the larger economy, as well as the Department of Energy developer ecosystem&mdash;there are lots of considerations when opening up API resources, that vary from industry to industry.</p>
<p>There are no silver bullets when it comes to API design, deployment, management, and evangelism. It takes a lot of hard work, communication, and iterating before you strike the right balance of operations, and every business sector will be different. Without knowing who your platform users are, and being able to establish a clear and transparent road for them to follow to achieve partner status, FamilySearch will never elevate to a true platform. How can you scale the trusted layers of your platform, if your partner framework isn&rsquo;t well documented, open, transparent, and well executed? It just can&rsquo;t be done.</p>
<p><strong>Meaningful Monetization For Platform</strong></p>
<p>All of this will take money to make happen. Designing, and executing on the technical, and the evangelism aspects I&rsquo;m laying out will cost a lot of money, and on the consumers side, it will take money to design, develop, and manage desktop, web, and mobile applications build around the FamilySearch platform. How will both the FamilySearch platform, and its participants make ends meet?</p>
<p>This conversation is a hard one for startups, and established businesses, let alone when you are a non-profit, mission driven organization. Internal developers cost money, server and bandwidth are getting cheaper but still are a significant platform cost--sustaining a sale, bizdev, and evangelism also will not be cheap. It takes money to properly deliver resources via APIs, and even if the lowest tiers of access are free, at some point consumers are going to have to pay for access, resources, and advanced features.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/07/a-better-understanding-of-government-apis-and-their-consumers-before-considering-charging-for-use/">conversation around how do you monetize API driven resources is going on across government, from cities up to the federal government</a>. Where the thought of charging for access to public data is unheard of. These are public assets, and they should be freely available. While this is true, think of the same situation, but when it comes to physical public assets that are owned by the government, like parks. You can freely enjoy many city, county, and federal parks, there are sometimes small fees for usage, but if you want to actually sell something in a public park, you will need to buy permits, and often share revenue with the managing agency.  We have to think critically about how we fund the publishing, and refinement of publicly owned digital assets, as with physical assets there will be much debate in coming years, around what is acceptable, and what is not.</p>
<p>Woven into the tiers of partner access, there should always be provisions for applying costs, overhead, and even generation of a little revenue to be applied in other ways. With great power, comes great responsibility, and along with great access for FamilySearch partners, many will also be required to cover costs of compute capacity, storage costs, and other hard facts of delivering a scalable platform around any valuable digital assets, whether its privately or publicly held.</p>
<p>Platform monetization doesn&rsquo;t end with covering the costs of platform operation. Consumers of FamilySearch APIs will need assistance in identify the best ways to cover their own costs as well. Running a successful desktop, web or mobile application will take discipline, structure, and the ability to manage overhead costs, while also being able to generate some revenue through a clear business model. As a platform, FamilySearch will have to bring to the table some monetization opportunities for consumers, providing guidance as part of the certification process regarding what are best practices for monetization, and even some direct opportunities for advertising, in-app purchases and other common approaches to application monetization and sustainment.</p>
<p>Without revenue greasing the gears, no service can achieve platform status. As with all other aspects of platform operations the conversation around monetization cannot be on-sided, and just about the needs of the platform providers. Pro-active steps need to be taken to ensure both the platform provider, and its consumers are being monetized in the healthiest way possible, bringing as much benefit to the overall platform community as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Open &amp; Transparent Operations &amp; Communications</strong></p>
<p>How does all of this talk of platform and evangelism actually happen? It takes a whole lot of open, transparent communication across the board. Right now the only active part of the platform is the FamilySearch Developer Google Group, beyond that you don&rsquo;t see any activity that is platform specific. There are active Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and mainstream and affiliate focused blogs, but nothing that serves the platform, contributed to the feedback loop that will be necessary to take the service to the next level.</p>
<p>On a public platform, communications cannot all be private emails, phone calls, or face to face meetings. One of the things that allows an online service to expand to become a platform, then scale and grow into robust, vibrant, and active community is a stream of public communications, which include blogs, forums, social streams, images, and video content.  These communication channels cannot all be one way, meaning they need to include forum and social conversations, as well as showcase platform activity by API consumers.</p>
<p>Platform communications isn&rsquo;t just about getting direct messages answered, it is about public conversation so everyone shares in the answer, and public storytelling to help guide and lead the platform, that together with support via multiple channels, establishes a feedback loop, that when done right will keep growing, expanding and driving healthy growth. The transparent nature of platform feedback loops are essential to providing everything the consumers will need, while also bringing a fresh flow of ideas, and insight within the FamilySearch firewall.</p>
<p><strong>Truly Shifting FamilySearch The Culture</strong></p>
<p>Top-down, bottom-up, outside-in, with constantly flow of oxygen via vibrant, flowing feedback loop, and the nourishing, and sanitizing sunlight of platform transparency, where week by week, month by month someone change can occur. It won&rsquo;t all be good, there are plenty of problems that arise in ecosystem operations, but all of this has the potential to slowly shift culture when done right.</p>
<p>One thing that shows me the team over at FamilySearch has what it takes, is when I asked if I could write this up a story, rather than just a proposal I email them, they said yes. This is a true test of whether or not an organization might have what it takes. If you are unwilling to be transparent about the problems you have currently, and the work that goes into your strategy, it is unlikely you will have what it takes to establish the amount of transparency required for a platform to be successful.</p>
<p>When internal staff, large external partners, and long tail genealogical app developers and enthusiasts are in sync via a FamilySearch platform driven ecosystem, I think we can consider a shift to platform has occurred for FamilySearch. The real question is how do we get there?</p>
<p><strong>Executing On Evangelism</strong></p>
<p>This is not a definitive proposal for executing on an API evangelism strategy, merely a blueprint for the seed that can be used to start a slow, seismic shift in how FamilySearch engages its API area, in a way that will slowly evolve it into a community, one that includes internal, partner, and public developers, and some day, with the right set of circumstances, FamilySearch could grow into robust, social, genealogical ecosystem where everyone comes to access, and participate in the mapping of mankind.</p>

<p>There is nothing easy about this. It takes time, and resources, and there are only so many elements you can automate when it comes to API evangelism. For something that is very programmatic, it takes more of the human variable to make the API driven platform algorithm work. With that said it is possible to scale some aspects, and increase the awareness, presence, and effectiveness of FamilySearch platform efforts, which is really what is currently missing.</p>
<p>While as the API Evangelist, I cannot personally execute on every aspect of an API evangelism strategy for FamilySearch, I can provide essential planning expertise for the overall FamilySearch API strategy, as well as provide regular checkin with the team on how things are going, and help plan the roadmap. The two things I can bring to the table that are reflected in this proposal, is the understanding of where the FamilySearch API effort currently is, and what is missing to help get FamilySearch to the next stage of its platform evolution.</p>
<p>When operating within the corporate or organizational silo, it can be very easy to lose site of how other organizations, and companies, are approach their API strategy, and miss important pieces of how you need to shift your strategy. This is one of the biggest inhibitors of API efforts at large organizations, and is one of the biggest imperatives for companies to invest in their API strategy, and begin the process of breaking operations out of their silo.</p>
<p>What FamilySearch is facing demonstrates that APIs are much more than the technical endpoint that most believe, it takes many other business, and political building blocks to truly go from API to platform.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saswatanand"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/saswat-anand.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I get quite a few nice comments about my blog(s) behind the scenes. Many are from the enterprise or insttutions, where I know I could never get away with publishing publicly. As the APi space has heated up in 2014, more people are trying to make sense of this API mayhem, and ultimately they come across my blog, and find &nbsp;valuable information that really helps them in their journey.</p>
<p>I have been considering adding a page, listing some of the kind words I get from folks--maybe I will someday, but today I received a nice email, one I couldn't help but ask if I could repost--so here is a nice message from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saswatanand">Saswat Anand</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have been reading your blogs and following you on Twitter for a couple of weeks now. I am a researcher in the Stanford&nbsp;University. By following your blogs and twits, I have been trying to understand the problems and opportunities in the API space.</p>
<p>I just wanted to drop a quick note to thank you for being a true evangelist for API's. I find your blogs very interesting both because of valuable information and your writing style.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Saswat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can't lie, the number one reason I do API Evangelist is for me, but the number two reason is to help folks like Saswat make sense of the space. I don't care whether you are a researcher in higher education, startup founder, or work at a government agency, I want you to understand APIs.</p>
<p>I couldn't be more stoked in my career right now, and be happier with what I'm doing. I was a little concerned if I had made the right decision to start API Evangelist back in 2010 and 2011, but in 2014, it has turned into some pretty meaningful work for me.</p>
<p>Thanks Saswat! Glad you find it valuable.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I never properly wrapped up my experience at <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API-Craft</a> last month, where I moderated a pretty important panel discussion on hypermedia with Mike Amundsen (<a href="http://bit.ly/1mtrwki">@mamund</a>), Mike Kelly (<a href="http://bit.ly/1hBxi4m">@mikekelly85</a>) Steve Klabnik (<a href="http://bit.ly/1wv9KVR">@steveklabnik</a>), Kevin Swiber (<a href="http://bit.ly/1oC7Udw">@kevinswiber</a>), J&oslash;rn Wildt (<a href="https://twitter.com/JornWildt">@JornWildt</a>), and Markus Lanthaler (<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkusLanthaler">@MarkusLanthaler</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The discussion was pretty amazing, I will let you watch for yourself. The action actually starts right at about 30:00 minute mark, so there is a lot of dead space until then.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.ustream.tv/embed/recorded/50652146?v=3&amp;wmode=direct" width="480" height="302"> </iframe> <br /><a style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; font-weight: normal; text-align: left;" href="http://www.ustream.tv" target="_blank">Broadcast live streaming video on Ustream</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Careful it is 3 hours of some pretty geeky talk, you might experience some hypermedia side effects. Seriously though, this is a pretty important video discussion about a very relevant, and often misunderstood part of API evolution. I highly recommend watching.</p>
<p>I'm just getting back down to this time period in my Evernote stack, so look for some more stories out of API Craft and hypermedia after rewatching this talk. Also stay tuned for upcoming stories from <a href="http://iloveapis2014.com/">I Love APIs in San Francisco</a>, <a href="http://www.apiacademy.co/api360/">#API360 Summit in Washington DC</a>, and of course <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">@APIStrat in Chicago</a> at the end of September.</p>

<p>I am making another pass through <a href="http://theapistack.com/">821 companies doing interesting things with APIs</a>, and flagging a handful of them as inactive. I will then attempt to contact each of the companies to see if anyone is home. All signs point to a handful of them being dormant projects, with silent blogs, twitter accounts, and other common streams you normally see flowing from API platforms.</p>
<p>If any of them are indeed shutting down, I&rsquo;m going to urge them to consider open sourcing as much of their API platform as they can, from server side, and client side code to API definitions. At the very least I would like to capture a snapshot of the API, the title, description, image, and a machine readable Swagger spec of the interface, to help record the pattern for future consideration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure some of these APIs will have investors they will have to consult before they can do something like open sourcing their API, and I&rsquo;m sure many of them won&rsquo;t even respond&mdash;I know how difficult it is after you have to put your startup down. Regardless I will at least flag them, make an attempt to contact, and if they don&rsquo;t respond I&rsquo;ll queue them up for profiling, and build an archive of abandoned API.</p>
<p>In forty years I&rsquo;ll be that old crazy guy in the neighborhood who has piles and piles of old APIs laying around his yard. ;-)  These damn things will be worth a fortune some day!!</p>
<p>Seriously, if you have an API that you are planning to deprecate, please reach out, I'd be happy to help archive it for the history books.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/08/28/explaining-my-work-around-apis-in-higher-education-to-institutions/">Explaining My Work Around APIs In Higher Education To Institutions</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/priorities/university-of-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m needing to quantify the work i do around APIs in higher education for a university in the U.K., so I figured I&rsquo;d craft into a story that I can share with my readers, and potentially other schools who would ask what it is that I do.</p>
<p>I am interested in APIs in higher education because I feel strongly that our institutions are a fertile environment for ensuring that the next generation of our society possess the digital literacy they will need to navigate and find success in our increasingly digital world.</p>
<p>When I mention that higher education institutions should be incorporating APIs into daily operations, most folks immediately think of a very technical, IT directed effort, which is one layer to the discussion that should be considered, but ultimately it is about developing an awareness, and engagement by administration, faculty, and the students with the increasingly public APIs that surround us, as well as internal institutional APIs.</p>
<p>Our personal, and business lives are moving into the cloud. We are increasingly dependent on web-based and mobile applications in many aspects of our lives, and a growing number of these software services have APIs, and API-enabled actions that can be taken by anyone, even non-developers.</p>
<p>My mission as the API Evangelist is to help everyone be aware that APIs exist, and that they are there to assist you in your personal and business life. Which brings me back to higher education institutions being an important place to expose students, and faculty to the benefits of APIs&mdash;in preparation for the increasingly API driven world unfolding around us.</p>
<p>While I pay attention to <a href="http://theapistack.com/">over a 100 categories of APIs</a>, let&rsquo;s take one area, <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=images-stack">photos and images</a>, and use as a backdrop for what I do. I pay attention to over <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=images-stack">25 photo and image APIs</a> that provide image related services for developers, as well as direct access to the popular photo and image platforms we often depend on like Flickr and Instagram.</p>
<p>As the API Evangelist I seek to pay attention to three key layers of the API space.</p>
<p><strong>Technology of APIs - </strong>The geeky detail of how APIs work.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>How do I authenticate?</li>
<li>Where do I read data from?</li>
<li>How do I write data?</li>
<li>Where are their code samples in my language?</li>
<li>Where is the WordPress plugin?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business of APIs - </strong>The business profile behind any online service.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>How much does the service cost?</li>
<li>What are the limitations of what I can read or write?</li>
<li>What kind of support is available to me?</li>
<li>What are the long term plans of company?</li>
<li>Is the platform and tools well documented?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Politics of APIs -</strong> The often complex politics behind the curtain.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Do I own my data? Do I own my photos?</li>
<li>Can I specify the license for my photos?</li>
<li>What are the security practices?</li>
<li>Do I have control over who access my data (aka oAuth)?</li>
<li>Are code libraries, tools, and other code open sourced?</li>
<li>Are the terms of service easy to understand? Fair?</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs are much more than just technology and when you compare platforms like Flickr and Instagram which both act as photo sharing platforms, but have widely different approaches to the technology, business, and politics of each of their APIs. Sometimes it is just small details that can make the difference in whether or not a platform is the right choice or not for any individual or business.</p>
<p>Beyond the technology, business, and politics I also pay attention to a handful of important trends that are growing out of the API space, to support API consumers.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com">Realtime</a> -</strong> What options are there to interact in realtime.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>How do I send / receive push notifications?</li>
<li>How do I use webhooks to receive updates?</li>
<li>Does this API have a streaming API?</li>
<li>What frameworks are available for real-time delivery?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">Aggregation</a> -</strong> Details on API data and information aggregation.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Can I get all of my images from Flickr, Instagram in a single feed?</li>
<li>Can I publish to one place, and have it syndicate out?</li>
<li>What options do I have for POSSE (Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">Reciprocity</a> </strong>- Approaches to moving data from one system to another.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Can I migrate all of my flickr images to dropbox?</li>
<li>Can I keep all of my flick, instagram, and other photo sites in sync?</li>
<li>Where is the best place to store my photos?</li>
<li>Can I transform images when moving from location to location?</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just about watching, and monitoring what is going on in the API space, my mission demands that I take what I learn and produce content that everyone else can benefit from. To fulfill this, I take all of my curation, analysis and awareness, and I work to create rich content that is designed for the widest distribution possible:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Short Form -</strong> Blog posts on my primary blogs (apievangelist.com, apivoice.com, api.report, theapistack.com, ipaevangelist.com, and kin lane.com)</li>
<li><strong>Long Form -</strong> White papers and ebooks that get published either public, or in some cases privately for internal organizational distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Presentations -</strong> Walkthroughs, talk presentations, and other interactive content that introduce people to the world of APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Videos - </strong>Generating video content, around my research and presentations for publishing to YouTube and other video distribution sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>I strongly feel that it isn&rsquo;t enough that I'm doing all of this work online, I&rsquo;m also invested in stimulating in-person conversations in the following formats:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Conversations -</strong> In person, small group conversations with team members about APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Classrooms -</strong> Teaching large, or small classrooms at institutions around the world.</li>
<li><strong>Meetups -</strong> Supporting the creation of, and guest speaking of API focused meetup groups around the world.</li>
<li><strong>Conferences -</strong> I support up to 10 API conferences, while also putting on my global conference on APIs called @APIStrat</li>
</ul>
<p>API evangelism for me is not just about educating developers that APIs exist, it is about bringing awareness to the masses that APIs exist, and they are just the next evolutionary layer of the web that has penetrated almost all aspects of our lives. I focus on bringing an awareness of APIs to:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Individuals -</strong> Every citizen. API literacy is like financial literacy, you don&rsquo;t need to understand the entire banking system, but you will need some basic financial literacy to manage your bank account, and credit cards&mdash;the same applies in the API space, you don&rsquo;t need to understand everything about oAuth, but you should know who has access to your bank account, Facebook, and YouTube accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Business -</strong> More business activity is occurring online, and APIs are rapidly making business data and information available to the average business user for use in spreadsheets, mobile and web applications. Basic API literacy is fast becoming a requirement for many business sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Institutions -</strong> Over the last 15 years, many institutions have moved online, establishing a web presence, and connecting with partners, and constituents via the web. Large organizations need to understand how to use APIs to become more resilient, agile, and nimble in an age where much is changing when it comes to how the institutions of yesterday are perceived and stay relevant in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Government - </strong>Our government is required to do more with less, and APIs are the way we are slowly shifting government of all sizes, operate and engage constituents. Federal, state, and local governments are opening up data, making resources available via APis, and shifting the burden of governance to private sector partners, and even the public using APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Helping everyone understand the API undercurrents that are occurring right now all around us, is my mission as the API Evangelist. Everyone needs to understand that APIs exist, and have a basic understanding of how they can put them to use in their personal and business world. This isn&rsquo;t some grand, techno vision being sold from Silicon Valley that I'm looking to sell to universities, this is about what is already happening around us on the web, via our personal mobile devices, our homes, businesses, cars, and much much more. API Evangelist is about helping regular folks see what is happening, understand as much of it sa they can, allowing them to take meaningful action with the context of their lives.</p>
<p>Continuing to bring this higher education API venn diagram tighter, is additional work I&rsquo;m doing with in two very quiet, but extremely important initiatives.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://umw.domains/">Domain of One&rsquo;s Own</a> -</strong> A program occurring at a handful of higher education institutions, where students get their own domain upon entering school, which can be used for their projects throughout their academic career, and even beyond if they choose&mdash;giving each student the gift of web literacy.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org/">Reclaim Your Domain</a> - </strong>A secondary project spun out of Domain of One&rsquo;s Own which is about providing education materials, tools, and other resources for students, and any other individual to map out their online domain, and put together a strategy for reclaiming parts of their digital identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>To do my work I use my own custom developed internal system, where I aggregate information about over 2500 APIs, 1500 RSS feeds, 2500 Twitter accounts, and 750 Github accounts. From there, all of my short form and long form content, as well as presentations, and other supporting research gets published to <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">75 individual open source research projects managed using Github</a>. My intent is to make sure all of my research, and resulting data is publicly available in open formats, allowing anyone to fork, extend, and expand on what I do.</p>
<p>How can my research help your institution better understand, internalize, and apply APIs?</p>

<p>When it comes to APIs, the quickest way to get an API for your company, organization or government agency is to choose to only use online services that have APIs. Twitter, Facebook, Google, Dropbox, Github, Instagram, Flickr, and many other popular services you already use, all have APIs.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m expanding on my tracking of <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment tools</a>, to include deploying APIs via Google Spreadsheets, and to scraping data from websites, I can&rsquo;t help but step back and consider truly what is the easiest way to deploy an API, which really is about choosing to use online services that already have an API--no connecting to your backend systems necessary!</p>
<p>We talk about APIs in the context of developers, using APIs to build applications for end-users, and provide system integrations. What if we talked about it in context of the users, and helping individual users aggregate their APIs into a single, personal API stack?</p>
<p>As Joe or Jane user, I could have my own personal API hub, with code samples, and other resources to understand how to access my APIs. I&rsquo;m not sure how oAuth would be triggered in this scenario (needs more thought), if a developer wanted access to my Facebook or other private data, but if I ran WordPress, and included my Flickr photos in my API stack, API access could be pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Thinking of this in the context of enabling personal API hubs is a pretty far out there concept, but understanding that you can have an isntant API just by using common services that have APIs, is pretty powerful. In reality, the average person will rarely ever need a personal developer hub with a stack of APIs, but if we teach people that they need an API with all the service they use, so they can use services like Zapier, and the other API-enabled tools, we might just be able to keep SaaS providers honest, ensuring they always public APIs, transparency and data portability for end-users.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-excel-icon.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking on the usage of spreadsheets in conjunction with APIs for several years now. Spreadsheets are everywhere, they are the number one data management tool in the world, and whether API developers like or not, spreadsheets will continue to collide with the API space, as both API providers, and consumers try to get things done using APIs.</p>
<p>APIs are all about getting access to the resources you need, and spreadsheets are being used by both API providers and consumers to accomplish these goals. It makes complete sense to me that business users would be looking for solutions via spreadsheets, as they are one potential doorway to hacking for the average person&mdash;writing macros, calculations, and other dynamic features people execute within the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>I know IT would like to think their central SQL, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and other database are where the valuable data and content assets are stored at a company, but in reality the most valuable data resources are often stored in spreadsheets across an organization. When it comes time to deploying APIs, this is the first place you should look for your datasources, resulting in Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheet to API solutions like we&rsquo;ve seen from <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">API Spark</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing spreadsheets used by companies to deploy APIs in some of the following ways:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Microsoft Excel - </strong>Turning Microsoft Excel spreadsheets directly into APIs. by taking a spreadsheet, and generating an API is the fastest way to go from closed data resource to an API for anyone to access, even without programming experience.</li>
<li><strong>Google Spreadsheet -</strong> Mounting public and private Google Spreadsheets is an increasingly popular way to publish smaller datasets as APIs. Since Google Spreadsheets is web-based, it becomes very easy to use the Google Spreadsheet API to access any Spreadsheet in a Google account, then generate a web API interface that can allow for reading or writing to a spreadsheet data source via a public, or privately secured API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond deploying APIs I&rsquo;m seeing API providers provide some innovative ways for users to connect spreadsheets to their APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Spreadsheet as Client -</strong> Electronic parts search API Octopart has been providing a bill of materials (BOM) solution via <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/31/giving-excel-power-users-the-api-driven-resources-they-need/">Microsoft Excel</a>, and now <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/25/ocotoparts-open-source-google-spreadsheet/">Google Spreadsheets</a>&nbsp;for their customers--providing a distributed parts catalog in a spreadsheet, that is kept up to date via public API.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheet as Cache -</strong> I&rsquo;ve talked with U.S. Census and other data providers about how they provide Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheet caches of API driven data, allowing users to browse, search and establish some sort of subset of data, then save as a spreadsheet cache for offline use. </li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheet as Catch-All -</strong> Spreadsheets aren&rsquo;t always being used just about data, you can see <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/20/route-sms-messages-to-google-spreadsheets-via-twilio-api-with-twiliosheet/">Twilio storing SMS</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/09/13/using-excel-for-crowdsourced-data-gathering-and-reporting/">NPR using as crowdsourced engine</a>, making spreadsheets into a nice bucket for catching just about anything an API can input or output.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving out of the realm of what API providers can do for their API consumers with spreadsheets, and into the world of what API consumers can do for themselves, you start to see endless opportunities for API integration with spreadsheets using reciprocity providers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a> - </strong>There are five pages of recipes on the popular API reciprocity provider Zapier that allow you to work with Google Docs, and 57 pages that are dealing directly with Google Drive, providing a wealth of tools that non-developers (or developers) can use when connecting common APIs up to Google Spreadsheets.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen enough movement in the area of Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheets being used with APIs to warrant closer monitoring. To support this I've started publishing most of my research to an <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist spreadsheet research site</a>, which will allow me to better track, curate, tag, and tell stories around spreadsheets and APIs.</p>
<p>As I do with my <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">60+ API research projects</a>, I will update this site when I have time, publishing anything I've read, written, and companies I think are doing interesting things spreadsheets and APIs. I'm pretty convinced that spreadsheets will be another one of those bridge tools we use to connect where we are going with APIs, with the reality of where the everyday person is, just trying to get their job done.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.jivesoftware.com/">Enterprise social API Jive Software</a> wins for the best developer landing page. Normally I tell folks, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/14/the-speed-of-federal-government-when-it-runs-on-github/">like I did with Trade.gov last week</a>, that your landing page should have a short, precise description of what you API does&mdash;this is some seriously valuable real estate, and you have one chance to make an impression.</p>
<p>I would put Jive Software into the category of more making a first impression, than providing a short description of what the API does:</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.jivesoftware.com/"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/jive-software/brew-up-something-awesome.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this approach for every API provider, but if you can do it right, and make a solid first impression&mdash;run with it! As an <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, and <a href="http://ipaevangelist.com">IPA Evangelist</a>, I can seriously get behind a message like &ldquo;brew up something awesome&rdquo;. +1</p>
<p>I like how they have apps, docs, APIs, and IPAs as taps, and the taps even work when you mouseover!  Seriously, all of this API shit is hard to make entertaining (trust me I know), and when you can provide this human touches while inciting innovation, they can go a long way in breaking the ice with consumers.</p>
<p>Right above the taps Jive Software provides the essential getting started, and register links for their APIs, which signals that beyond the fun facade, they mean business, and want to help you onboard with using their APIs. I haven&rsquo;t dug deep into the Jive Software API to see what else is going on, but after this first impression it is likely I will be looking around more, now that they made a good first impression.</p>

<p><a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com/">Containers</a> are a fast growing trend when it comes to delivering compute resources online. Reflecting the world of API design, I feel containers are about deploying exactly the cloud resources you will need to complete a specific compute objective, then putting everything into a single virtualized container definition, that can be forked, clone, scaled, and evolved indpendently of any other resources. Each individual container posesses everything it will need from the operating system, file system, database, necessary libraries, and APIs to accomplish its given objective.</p>
<p>Virtual containers will make API driven resources even more agile, nimble and scalable--not just for providers, but also for consumers. Everything we have right now I would consider to be a retail API market&mdash;where even though APIs are often sold B2B, they are generally a one-size fits all API solution. Think about when API resources become modular, customizable, scalable, wholesale resources that can be bought and sold, and deployed anywhere, making all digital assets into commodities that are ready for use anywhere in the API economy.</p>
<p>My goal is to understand how APIs and containers work together, and as I do with all of my research <a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com/">I setup a Github repo</a> for tracking every piece of container news I read that I feel is relevant, each company doing interesting things containers, tools for working with containers, and ultimately my analysis. Cloud computing will continue to be the lead driver of innovation in the API space, and I feel the introduction of cloud computing in 2006&ndash;2008 gave legitimacy to web APIs&mdash;you could now deploy global infrastructure using web APIs, game on. I think containerization will take API design, deployment, management and integration to the next phase, and closer the early visions of a programmable web we all started envisioning around 2005.</p>
<p>I will be taking each of my API designs, and <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/an-operational-harness-for-my-screen-capture-api/">developing an Amazon Machine Image, Heroku App version, as well as a docker container definition</a>. I want every one of my open source API designs to have the option to be deployed in any cloud environment, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/23/push-button-api-deployment-with-the-heroku-button/">preferable with the click of a button, as with Heroku</a>. In the future it won&rsquo;t about knowing about all the APIs, it will be about having the right stack of APIs, that you can deploy anywhere, anytime.</p>
<p>I will be talking on this subject at <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">@APIStrat in Chicago this September</a>, and also at <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag in Colorado this November</a>, let me know if you want to connect around the subject.</p>

<p>I have been doing a lot of research into the world of financial APIs, specifically looking at some of the larger companies providing APIs that deliver market news, data, corporate profiles, and other data that make markets go round.</p>
<p>As I consider some of the common building blocks that are common across many financial API--real-time data frameworks, and visualization tools are two of the top items that I think will be part of every financial API stack in the future. Almost every API I looked at had some sort of real-time stream, promising data faster, as well as a way to extract meaning from these streams using template, or custom visualizations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tracking on <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">real-time API services</a> and tools, and i&rsquo;ve been seeing some of these frameworks, like Firebase <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/21/what-i-have-been-calling-api-trends-are-slowly-being-baked-into-api-operations/">getting baked in by default to some API platforms</a>. I am also tracking on visualization tools, I just don&rsquo;t have the research published as a Github repository yet, like I do with my real-time research.</p>
<p>I will keep tracking on API providers who are doing interesting things with real-time or visualizations, and hopefully be able to publish more examples. I can&rsquo;t help but think there are some pretty interesting opportunities for open frameworks, and white label solutions for API providers when it comes to real-time, and visualization layers on top of their existing APIs.</p>

<p>I was keeping an eye out for interesting API stories on <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/">ProductHunt</a> the other day and came across an cool notification startup that lives in the Stripe API ecosystem, called <a href="https://hooked.io/">Hooked</a>.</p>
<p>Hooked allows users to set up notifications for any events related to a Stripe account. Hooked uses the Stripe API to disocver events, and then employs webhooks to send notifications.</p>
<p>As I'm writing this story, I realize this is very similar to my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/26/realtime-and-visualizations-will-be-key-in-financial-api-deployments/">previous story today about real-time and visualization layers for APIs</a>, and that notifications could easily be provided as a white label solution for API providers, giving them a ready to go notification layer to their APIs.</p>
<p>Right now I lump notifications in my research under <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">real-time</a>, but I think I will be pulling it out into its own research area. Notifications are real-time, but they are more messaging than just a real-time feature, but they are kind of more real-time than just a message too. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>We'll see. That is the fun of my API Evangelist research network, is that all of it is pretty liquid&mdash;allowing me to keep moving things around until they make sense in my head.</p>

<p>My friend Mark Silverberg (<a href="https://twitter.com/skram">@skram</a>), pointed out a very cool API the other day, that geolocates zip codes, and appropriately named&nbsp;<a href="http://ziplocate.us/">ZipLocate</a>. What I really like about ZipLocate is that they do one thing, and they do it well. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong I love me some AWS and Twilio, who have industrial grade APIs, but I also have a love for simple, lightweight APIs that focus on one thing.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing about ZipLocate is that it is always free, and never rate limited. He says that it is relatively cheap to host the API, because bandwidth usage is light, with all API calls are heavily cached. I like this type of micro service design--I want thousands more just like it.</p>
<p>What I also dig about ZipLocate is that if you <em>&ldquo;...don't trust the API to be around tomorrow? Host it yourself. Source code and data import scripts available on Github&rdquo;</em>. This is possible because the ZipLocate API is open source, and the data comes from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html">Census Bureau</a>. This approach to developing dead simple APIs on top of government data is really important, and I personally feel that <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/08/25/6482-datasets-available-across-22-federal-agencies-in-datajson-files/">all 6,482 data sets across 22 federal agencies who have published their data.json file</a>, should have APIs just like ZipLocate.</p>
<p>It looks like ZipLocate is a project developed by Nathan Cahill (<a href="https://twitter.com/nathancahill">@nathancahill</a>). I like his style, and think his approach is simple, elegant, yet extremely powerful, and provides a blueprint that others can follow when <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/23/models-for-api-driven-startups-built-around-public-data-/">designing, developing and deploying APIs built on top of public data</a>.</p>

<p>To support this I've separate out my APIs here into two separate pages, my <a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/core-apis.html">core APIs</a>, which will provide access to content across the API Evangelist network, and my <a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/stack-apis.html">stack APIs</a> which will all be the modular, API Stack designs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/api-picker"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google/which-api-do-i-need.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think that the table layout Google uses is a particularly good one, resulting in a pretty busy looking matrix. I don't think it is a perfect solution, but I like the idea of providing developers with some sort of assistance in understand which API to use, based upon their goals.</p>
<p>This is something that a larger API provider would probably do, but a simple little needs calculator that could help users translate what they are looking for into what the API does, is an interesting concept to play with for some API providers.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m riding the build up for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">APIStrat in Chicago</a>, and preparing for <a href="http://iloveapis2014.com/">I Love APIs in San Francisco</a>, and the <a href="http://www.apiacademy.co/api360/">API 360 Summit in DC</a>, I can&rsquo;t help but think about how busy the API event scene is getting&mdash;in 2014 there are 14 separate conferences focused on the world of APIs.</p>
<p>In the beginning there was just <a title="Gluecon" href="http://gluecon.com/">Gluecon</a>, <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag</a>, and the <a href="http://www.apiconference.com/">Business of APIs</a>, then 3Scale and API Evangelist got together and started planning for @APIStrat, then immediately <a href="http://apidays.io/">API Days</a> happened, <a href="http://nordicapis.com/">Nordic APIs</a> came on the scene, <a href="http://api-craft.org/">API-Craft</a>a&nbsp; grew beyond just Meetup, and before you know we have 14 separate events.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be biased here, because @APIStrat is my baby, and I&rsquo;ve been involved in supporting API Days since day, so these two events will always have a special place in my heart. Even with this I believe in interoperability in the community and I am working to support all of the events equally, so if you are organizing make sure and reach out.</p>
<p>You can find me at I Love APIs in a couple weeks in San Francisco, as well as at API 360 in Washington DC the same week, and of course @APIStrat in Chicago at the end of September, and Nordic APIs in October. Unfortunately we messed up in planning @APIStrat, and made it at the same time as REST Fest, which seriously pissed me off&mdash;so I won&rsquo;t be attending REST Fest yet again this year. :-( This is part of the reason I'm putting together this research, so I don't make this mistake again.</p>
<p>As with the rest of my work, <a href="http://events.apievangelist.com/">I setup a Github repo, and website to give me a single place to aggregate information on API events</a>. I will do my best keep up to date, for my own education, but I am also looking to help you understand each of the events, the organizers, sponsors, speakers, and also who is attending. As I have time I will aso add a section for API Meetups, so we can keep tabs on the smaller API gatherings that are going on in various cities around the globe.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to participate in one of the conferences listed as a speaker or sponsor let me know, I&rsquo;ll hook you up with the organizer. If you&rsquo;d like to organize a meet up in your town, or you would like to bring in guest speakers from the outside API community, let me know as well&mdash;no guarantees, but I will see what I can do.</p>
<p>As with the rest of the space, I will do my best to keep my <a href="http://events.apievangelist.com/">API events research</a> up to date, and as with the rest of my research, feel free <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-events">fork and contribute</a> where you can&mdash;I need all the help I can get!</p>

<p>Octopart's approach to using both Microsoft Excel, and Google Spreadsheets as an interface for the average business person is pretty interesting, not because it is the perfect technological solution, but because it brings the value of APIs closer to the actual business problem owners.</p>
<p>Octopart <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/31/giving-excel-power-users-the-api-driven-resources-they-need/">helped increase my awareness of spreadsheets being in conjunction with APIs</a>, but after seeing other providers like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/20/route-sms-messages-to-google-spreadsheets-via-twilio-api-with-twiliosheet/">Twilio using Google Spreadsheet for storing SMS</a>, and the increased usage of <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API reciprocity providers like Zapier</a>, making me think spreadsheets have quite a future in the API space.</p>

<p>I am super stoked to announce that we have Andrew Nacin (<a href="https://twitter.com/nacin">@nacin</a>), the lead developer from WordPress keynoting <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Chicago</a> next month. We are looking to continue the conversation around an official WordPress API, scheduled for inclusion in the WordPress 4.1 release.</p>
<p>While an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/02/everyone-is-about-to-get-an-api-with-the-new-wordpress-api/">API for WordPress may not seem like anything that big</a>, when you think about it being baked into WordPress by default, it means that over 60 million websites will potentially get an API, and 22% of the top 10 million websites run WordPress&mdash;a pretty significant shift.</p>
<p>WordPress is still taking feedback on their upcoming API release, and you can <a href="http://wp-api.org/">visit their website and participate there</a>, and now you can also come to Chicago the end of September, and hear Andrew talk about his work at WordPress, and participate in the convversation around the WordPress API afterwards in the halls.</p>
<p>Make sure and <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/register.php">get registered soon</a>, you only have 4 weeks left before we all come together for @APIStrat in Chicago.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/heroku/heroku-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The new <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-button">Heroku Button</a> gets us one step closer to a new age of API deployment, where anyone can deploy the APIs they need without any developer or IT resources. As I&rsquo;m working on packaging up API designs for my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API</a>, and <a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">image manipulation API</a>, this type of approach is what I&rsquo;m envisioning for all of my APIs in the future&mdash;push button API deployment.</p>
<p>You shouldn't have to wait to deploy the API you need. Just as we are beginning to deploy pre-packaged application stacks like Wordpress, and Drupal, we should be able to deploy common API deployments for images, blogs, videos, and much, much more, with a single click of a button. Once any new API is launched it can be configured, and connected to other systems using the API, allowing it to operate as part of larger stack, or stay as completely independent node &nbsp;that just checks in with the mother ship from time to time.</p>
<p>While there will remain a handful of API leaders like Twilio and SendGrid who will have a big presence, many of the APIs in this next wave of API deployment will be smaller, and more transient in nature, taking advantage of current cloud trends around PaaS, and containerization.  This new type of APis will possess a self contained blueprint for the OS, database, server-side code, API definition, and even configuration, integration, and automation tooling for the API.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on Docker definitions for <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">creen capture</a>&nbsp;and<a href="http://image.manipulation.apievangelist.com/">image manipulation AP</a>, as well as other APIs I develop in the future, but first I think any API I deisn shouldl run as a Heroku app, that anyone can deploy in their own account with a single click of a button. It won't take much work to make this happen for any API I deploy, and since <a title="3Scale API Infrastructure" href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API infrastructure</a>, which I use to secure my APIs, already <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/deploying-apis-using-heroku-and-3scale-addon/">runs on Heroku</a>--making securing, and managing my Heroku deployed APis seamless.</p>

<p>The other night I was <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/08/18/all-government-should-have-a-social-media-directory-api/">writing about the need for a social media directory API</a>, like the one <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/federal-agency-directory/">the GSA has launched for the federal government</a>, but specifically for the City of Chicago. I was trying to get a list of each of the City of Chicago Twitter accounts, and while I&rsquo;m glad there is a <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/narr/misc/social_media.html">central social media account list</a>, I always want an API so I can eliminate the need for data entry.</p>
<p>After I posted my story, Oliver Seiler (<a href="https://twitter.com/0seiler">@0seiler</a>) emailed me the <a href="https://www.govt.nz/api/v1">API endpoint for the New Zealand Government Directory API</a>, which doesn't include the social media information that our <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/social-media-registry.shtml">federal government social media directory API</a> delivers, but offers another look at what one possible pattern for government directory APIs is.</p>
<p>This is one of the by-products of&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/10/low-hanging-fruit-for-api-discovery-in-the-federal-government/">my profiling of federal government APIs</a>, that I will begin to see API patterns that ALL government possess, things like a directory API. There should be a WordPress of the government directory API, a open source PHP Web API, possessing a common API definition, allowing any government agency, of any level, to be able to quickly download and deploy a directory API for their branch of government.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping when I&rsquo;m done with my profiling of 120 federal government APIs, I'll have better suggestions of which APIs patterns government agencies should be offering by default. I will also have API definitions for all of these government API patterns, which I can probably pretty quickly crank out server side API code to support&mdash;who knows maybe <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/02/everyone-is-about-to-get-an-api-with-the-new-wordpress-api/">Wordpress 4.1 will be available by then and I can use Wordpress as an API deployment framework</a>.</p>
<p>Until then I will just start tracking on all the common patterns for government API deployment, and publish as stories her on API Evangelist, and on my <a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/">federal government research site</a>. I'm thinking other things I'm tracking on, like API deployment using containers, and deployment via PaaS platforms like Heroku, will contribute to this type of API deployment across government as well, making it a very interesting time to be in tech.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design">I stumbled across a cool resource out of Heroku today, their </a><a href="https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design">HTTP API design guide</a>, which intends to direct practices for API design on the Heroku API platform.</p>
<p>Heroku&rsquo;s goals around APIs design are, "consistency and focusing on business logic while avoiding design bikeshedding&rdquo;.  They put out the guide to drive consistent aPI design practices at Heroku, but are also interested in sharing with the wider API community.</p>
<p>I think API design best practices are something every API provider should have, and publish publicly (on Github). I think it is ok to even fork, and modify existing guides like Heroku&rsquo;s or maybe <a href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards">from 18F out of federal government</a>. This most important thing is that you have a guide that can guide your team, or other teams within your organization.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m seeing more of these, I will start flagging, and aggregating them so we can browse and continue learn the API design practices from the leading API providers out there.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2014</span>

<p>In my monitoring of the API space, when I started seeing a large number of blog posts, tweets, companies, and other elements I track on get tagged with the same tag over and over, I take notice. My blogging, CRM, and news curation system all have their own <a href="http://theapistack.com/">tag cloud interface</a> for the week, showing which tags have been applied--so if a tag gets heavy usage, I know it.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years, I've spun up new research into other areas within the world of APIs, beyond my core <a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a title="API Deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a title="API Evangelism" href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com">evangelism</a>, <a title="API Discovery" href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a>, and <a title="API Integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a> research. I created separate buckets beyond just provide and consume to track on these new areas, called <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">trends</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/opportunities/">opportunities</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/priorities/">priorities</a>.</p>
<p>In 2014 it is beginning to seem like each of my trend research areas are getting baked directly into API platforms, ranging from real-time features with Firebase, to reciprocity by default using Zapier. API providers are learning that having a real-time layer, or a reciprocity layer baked into their platform is a good thing, and why reinvent the wheel when you have kick ass solutions like <a title="Firebase" href="http://bit.ly/1w9oJSq">Firebase</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/SzPnEh">Zapier</a>.</p>
<p>It makes sense that API providers would be looking externally to deliver&nbsp;<a title="API Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">aggregation</a>, <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">real-time</a>, <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">reciprocity</a>, and even <a title="Voice APIs" href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">voice</a> layers for their API platforms--this stuff is hard, and why spread yourself too thin. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/providing-users-with-reciprocity-tools-so-important-intuit-purchases-itduzzit/">Intuit just bought reciprocity provider itDuzzit</a>, and I think we will more providers <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">integrating Zapier into their platforms by default like Nimble did</a>. We'll also see <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/27/nest-provides-a-realtime-layer-by-default-for-api-consumers/">more API platforms bring in Firebase as a real-time layer like Nest did for their Internet of Things (Iot) thermostat API platform</a>.</p>
<p>Overall it seems like a white label solution that any API provider could put to use when considering solutions for aggregation, real-time, reciprocity, voice or even data solutions including spreadsheet connectors, analysis, and visualization, would do well in the space. At the very least, any company looking to step up and provide solutions in these areas, should definitely have a strong partner program like Zapier and Firebase have brought to the table.</p>
<p>I will have to start considering how to migrate aggregation, real-time, reciprocity, voice out of the trends bucket and into either the provide or consume buckets, or maybe both. It would seem that both API providers and consumers need to be educated in these areas, and made aware of what solutions are available.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that worried about the overall structure of API Evangelist at the moment. That is one of the beautiful aspects of how I architected the site(s), is that each research area lives as its own node on the network, so I can move around, shift as I need to find the right formula&mdash;something that helps me in a very fast moving space, where my understanding is constantly shifting and evolving with the swift currents of the APi space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/open-fda-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I first wrote about <a href="https://open.fda.gov/">openFDA</a> back in June, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">showcasing the launch of their new developer area</a>, and I'm happy to see they aren't missing a beat when it comes to launching new APIs. I recently saw that openFDA just launch a new endpoint, called the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/label/">Drug Label API</a>, which allows you to query over 60K prescriptions and over-the-counter drug labels.</p>
<p>It is satisfying to see such a large government agency find their API mojo. The original spark at the FDA was lit by Presidential Innovate Fellow Sean Herron (<a href="https://twitter.com/seanherron">@seanherron)</a>, but most recently Sean has handed off the iniative to an internal team who will keep they platform moving forward using the same formula.</p>
<p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/Drug_facts_label_gl01.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Beyond just the API, openFDA is also seriously putting the "open" in openFDA with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fda/openfda">Public Repo on GitHub&nbsp;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://opendata.stackexchange.com/search?q=openFDA">Extensive Community Q&amp;A on StackExchange</a></li>
<li><a href="https://open.fda.gov/terms/">Progress Terms of Service for Government</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Everything the openFDA is doing provides a great blueprint for other agencies to follow, from their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/17/adding-data-visualization-layer-to-interactive-api-documentation/">creative evolution of the interactive API documentation</a>, to encouraging other federal agencies to fork, and use the openFDA TOS in their own platforms.</p>
<p>The work coming out of the FDA makes me happy, because it sets a strong example that other agencies can follow, provides the rest of us with something positive that we can highlight when working to change public opinion, but also because it is such extremely vital data, and should be available in full download, and API format so that it can stimulate web and mobile app development, and system integration across the private sector.</p>

        <p><a href="https://platform.pokitdok.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/pokitdok.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m adding <a href="https://platform.pokitdok.com">PokitDok</a>, a simple API for healthcare to <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>, and my overall <a href="http://healthcare.apievangelist.com/">APIs in healthcare research</a>. Well I didn't exactly add them, PokitDok added themselves to my healthcare research by forking the Github repository, and adding themselves to the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/healthcare/blob/gh-pages/data/companies.json">JSON data source</a>&mdash;once I received the pull request, I accepted, and they were published on the site.</p>
<p>Usually once a week I spend time to manually adding new companies I've come across in my monitoring of the API space, but being a one man show I can&rsquo;t find everything across this massively expanding space. This is why I depend on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> to help me curate the best from across the space. Not everyone knows that the entire API Evangelist network of <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">60+ research projects</a> all runs on Github, which allows anyone to help write posts, curate industry news, and maintain the lists of API providers.</p>
<p>As soon as I accepted the pull request for PokitDok, I also tagged them as &ldquo;API Stack&rdquo;, which immediately adds PokitDok to <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>, listed under healthcare. No matter which doorway a company enters, I will make sure they get published to all appropriate research areas across the API Evangelist network, using my tagging system.</p>
<p>Thanks PokitDok for adding yourself, and I look forward to paying attention to the good things coming our of your API platform via your <a href="https://pokitdok.com/blog/">Blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PokitDok">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/pokitdok">Github</a> profiles.</p>

<p>I depend on a <a href="http://kinlane.reclaimyourdomain.org/2014/04/14/details-about-the-52-online-services-i-depend-on/">number of cloud services to make my personal and business world go round</a>. Even as a programmer, who can hand code just about any script to integrate, automate, and orchestrate my world, I find myself using more reciprocity services like <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> and <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API reciprocity providers</a> are one of the most important evolutions of the API space, because they make the whole world of APis accessible to the normals, and not just to the geek crowd. My time is valuable, and personally I'd rather being using existing tools and services, rather than re-inventing the wheel, and when it comes to orchestrating my online life, I need all the help I can, which is why I am looking IFTTT and Zapier for help.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using both platforms in 2014, but as I do with any other software I&rsquo;ve been dating for any sustained period, I start looking at getting a little more serious. This is where I have to part ways with IFTTT, and other other platforms that don&rsquo;t have <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/31/provide-release-valves-for-api-rate-limits/">clear relief valves for their free tier</a>, allowing me to start paying monthly or annually for my use of their service, and sensibly scale up as my needs grow.</p>
<p>Zapier has a pretty straightforward <a href="https://zapier.com/app/pricing">pricing framework</a>, giving you just enough room to get hooked, then you can pay for more usage as needed. Having a free tier for any cloud service is essential, but having a tiered business model, and <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">clear monetization strategy</a>, so I know that you will be around in the future, is a requirement.</p>
<p>I will keep my IFTT account to play with, but when it comes operating my business, continuing to integrate Zapier into my workflow makes sense as they have a clear business model that fits my needs. Plus <a href="https://zapier.com/developer/">Zapier has an API</a>. Ummmm&hellip;hello? An API for your automation and integration layer across all the services you depend on, via their APIs--how cool is that!</p>
<p>When launching your own APIs, make sure it has a clear, visible, intuitive and ascendable service framework--it is something that will go a long way in helping companies decide if they will use your APIs, or not.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.uber.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/uber-logo.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The sharing economy is booming, and with the release of the <a href="https://developer.uber.com/">Uber API</a>, the attention on this space will only increase. Personally I&rsquo;m only  interested in the surface area of the API that Uber has released, and what it tells about the opportunity for API designers in the sharing economy.</p>
<p>I think the surface area of the Uber API is pretty minimal, but very significant when you look at it as a glimpse of what is to come, as the sharing economy gets a direct pipeline to the API economy, and the resulting app economy. Oh yeah, I went there&mdash;I used all the economy buzzwords in once sentence. Seriously, I think the five endpoints that Uber launched with, are very telling:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>/products</li>
<li>/estimates/price</li>
<li>/estimates/time</li>
<li>/history</li>
<li>/me</li>
</ul>
<p>These API endpoints represent the beginning of the shared economy API surface area, and while there will be many additions, augmentations, and different takes on what APIs look like in the sharing economy, I predict many other providers will often emulate Uber in their own design.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really equipped to make a judgement on the value or importance of the Uber API. What I can do is keep an eye on Uber, and other sharing economy startup and their APIs, and look for patterns across each of the implementations. Hopefully the space can remain true to their roots, and make sure the API definitions are shareable, and reusable across the flourishing sharing app sapce.</p>
<p>Uber is focused specifically in the transportation portion of the sharing economy, and this makes me consider the bigger picture, and who will step up to serve the larger sharing economy, with an Uber API platform for the sharing economy. I think much like the wider API space, as the sharing API space matures out there will lots of opportunities for aggregation, real-time, automation, messaging, payments, and other API essentials that are in service of the sharing economy.</p>

<p>I tag a lot of interesting companies that show up during my weekly API monitoring. When I see a tag go from 1 or 2, to over 5 companies--I take a closer look to see what is going on. An increase in the number of companies focusing in a specific area could be a trend, or it could be nothing.</p>
<p>The tag "API Agency" ticked over to 6 today, when I added&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aquevix.com/">Aquevix</a>, an indian company that is focusing on API development. As of August 2014 I now have six separate agency style companies that I've found who have a focus on API design and development:</p>

<p>We'll see how many more dev shops I find in the next couple months. Sometimes when I start focusing in a new area I will find more companies working in the same area, purely because I'm looking harder, and sometimes it takes time for things to actually heat up.</p>
<p>As I'm looking at local Chicago web and mobile development shops during the lead up to <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practce in Chicago</a> next month, and I'm learning that many small shops like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/how-are-mobile-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-dave-devitt-at-sydcon/">SYDCON</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/18/how-are-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-bryson-pouw-at-blaze-portfolio/">Blaze Portfolio</a> are using APIs, they just havn't shifted their marketing and web site content to reflect the evolution.</p>
<p>It won't take much for many of these web and mobile development shops to standardize their API design and development services, much like the evolution we saw occur from web to mobile development, shifting the focus of the small dev shop to better serve a growing demand for API design, and development. I think by 2015 I'll see over 50 development shops, who are heavily focused on API design and developmennt in my API tracking system.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/tic-tac-toe.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking with a very nice recruiter over at Google over the last couple weeks, and she has been so kind in keeping me updated about opportunities for evangelism at Google. This is the 3rd round of talks I've had with Google while being the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, talks that historically go nowhere because of their programming test, which is a super silly aspect of their HR process.</p>
<p>I was straight up with the Google recruiter a couple of weeks ago when she first emailed me, and again when we talked on the phone last week&mdash;I do not take programming tests to open up doors for employment conversations, sorry. ;-( It is a waste of my time, and yours, and doesn&rsquo;t measure shit. I understand that you have to qualify large number of folks, at your very algorithmic-centric company, but when it comes to measuring what I do, a programming test isn&rsquo;t a thing.</p>
<p>If programming a tic-tac-toe game on a live screen share is what you need to open up a conversation with professionals around evangelizing your platform, you need to look elsewhere. Nowhere in my role as the API Evangelist do I have to code under time pressure with someone else watching, sorry. I would even say, having hacker skills, trumps programming skills in a public facing evangelism role, and speed, quality of code go out the window. This is about making connections through hacker storytelling, something that doesn't always pencil out to producing best code, and is more about helping people understand what is possible using a platform, in the most meaningful way&mdash;requiring more focus on the person and their problems, not the code or algorthm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve managed to have man very meaningful conversations with other tech giants like Intel, IBM, large institutions like UC Berkeley, BYU, and establish fruitful relationships with partners like 3Scale and API Spark, and across federal agencies like Department of Education, Energy, NASA, and the White House around APIs--all without taking programming tests. I talk to startups, SMBs, SMEs, organizations, institutions, and government agencies a lll the time, and never have to code under pressure, in front of an audience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not under the influence that I will change your hiring practices Google&mdash;you are a very smart, and successful company. All I&rsquo;m saying is you are probably filtering out some pretty talented folks, who are extremely passionate and knowledgeable in what they do, and connected in their space, and when you won&rsquo;t engage in meaningful conversations without a programming test, your missing out.</p>
<p>I actually prefer working with organizations from the outside in, I think it better reflects the essence of API Evangelism. The companies who have trouble working with outside entities, without tradition HR processes, are probably not going to lead when it comes developing an API driven ecosystem.</p>
<p>If your company doesn't have the time to research me, and understand what I bring to the API space, and what my skills are, we probably aren't a fit. Everything about me is available online at <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/kinlane">Github</a>--you just have to look. If you are only looking at <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane-resume/Resume-Kin-Lane-API-Evangelist-Summary.pdf">resumes</a>, and making people take tests, you will probably get what you are looking for!</p>

<p>If you follow <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog">Twilio blog</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/twilio">Twitter account</a> you can always find a good API story from the API leader. It also makes me happy to see trends I&rsquo;m seeing from other provider re-enforced by the API heavyweight. This time is providing spreadsheet integration with common API resources, like Twilio SMS.</p>
<p>Twilio has a pretty slick tool they call <a href="http://twiliosheet.azurewebsites.net/">TwilioSheet</a> that allows you to receive SMS messages in a Google Spreadsheet, and created a <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/08/connecting-twilio-sms-to-google-spreadsheet.html">pretty nice walkthrough of the entire setup</a>. Providing this type of functionality helps, as Twilio says, "make it easy for developers and non-developers alike to receive SMS messages in a Google Spreadsheet&rdquo;&mdash;<strong>emphasis on the non-developers.</strong></p>
<p>Whether we like it or not, the spreadsheet is the #1 database solution in the world, and provide a huge opportunity when it comes to bridging the world of APIs with the wider business landscape. This is something that <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API reciprocity providers like Zapier</a> have bridging for a while now, and something that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/providing-users-with-reciprocity-tools-so-important-intuit-purchases-itduzzit/">API providers like Intuit are looking to bank into their API platforms</a>.</p>
<p>When you see Twilio doing something like providing providing spreadsheet integration for their API platform, you have to stop and consider whether or not it is something that might work for your own API platform. Spreadsheet integration by default with API your driven resources is a great way to expand the reach of any API, bringing these valuable resources within reach of the actual, everyday problem owners.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.producthunt.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/product-hunt/product-hunt-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It can be hard to keep up with what the latest geek trends are--where all of the latest digital watering holes are&nbsp;(especially when your old), that allow you to find the latest info, conversations, and links to everything cool and hip. I depend on my network of API peeps for tips, and last week I was introduced to a new place that I wanted to pass on to you, called <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a>.</p>
<p>Product Hunt does a good job of describing what they do:</p>
<blockquote><em>Product Hunt surfaces the best new products, every day. It's a place for product-loving enthusiasts to share and geek out about the latest mobile apps, websites, hardware projects, and tech creations.</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the site open for the last five days, scanning for cool tech creations that grab my attention, and when I opened the tab today, I noticed that APIs dominated the top of the list.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.producthunt.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/product-hunt/product-hunt-api.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>You see the Uber API (of course), and Zapier both jockeying for top slots, as well as Product Hunts API too. Product Hunt allows you to post product name, tagline, and url for any web, mobile or single page app&mdash;a format that is perfect for publishing and sharing your individual API resource creations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be adding Product Hunt as an <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/">API Evangelism building block</a>, publishing my own API creations, as well as encouraging my API readers to do the same. The platform seems like a great way to show off your API, and generate buzz (or not) around each API resource we bring to the table.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.intuit.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/intuit/intuitbig.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the interoperability, automation, and reciprocity providers I track on <a href="https://developer.intuit.com/blog/2014/08/13/intuit-acquires-itduzzit-syncing-data-between-cloud-apps-gets-easier">itDuzzit has been acquired by the accounting platform Intuit</a>.  Usually acquisitions are just news, and not worthy of analysis here on API Evangelist, but I feel the itDuzzit acquisition is a significant sign when it comes to API providers, consumers, and <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">reciprocity providers</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been seeing more <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">API providers offer IFTTT or Zapier integration as a default option, in their own developer hubs</a>. I think the Intuit acquisition of itDuzzit reflects this evolution in how APIs are deployed, and consumed, something that has been pushed forward by this new generation of API reciprocity providers.</p>
<p>The Intuit announcement recognizes that this new breed of reciprocity providers have the potential to reach beyond a core developer audience by:</p>
<blockquote><em>The itDuzzit technology allows multiple audiences to create sophisticated integrations with very little coding required.  With their technology combined with the range of QuickBooks platform services we already offer, the breadth and depth of integrations our partners can build will grow tremendously. itDuzzit&rsquo;s sophisticated rules-based engine really set them apart from the competition, and their technology benefits the entire QuickBooks Online ecosystem: third-party developers, accountants and small businesses.</em></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://cloud.itduzzit.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/intuit/itduzzit.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The world of accounting seems like a great place to start when providing interoperability, automation, and reciprocity tools that are not just developers, but also empower end-users to use API. If you are as advanced as Zapier, <a href="https://zapier.com/developer/">even your reciprocity layer will have an API that developers</a>&nbsp;can&nbsp;put to use when taking advantage of the cross platform API integration and automation possibilities.</p>
<p>I will keep an eye on the <a href="https://developer.intuit.com">Intuit partner Platform</a>, and see what they end up doing with itDuzzit.  According to the press release, "<em>The Intuit and itDuzzit teams are already collaborating to fold the technology into the Intuit Partner Platform&rdquo;</em>, and hopefully we&rsquo;ll see some interesting API reciprocity patterns that I can highlight here on API Evangelist, and other API providers can follow when considering their own reciprocity layer for their own platform</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/vstudio" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/microsoft/visual-studio.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The Bing Developer Center team <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bingdevcenter/archive/2014/08/18/bing-developer-assistant-for-visual-studio-focuses-on-improving-productivity-within-the-experience.aspx">has released a pretty interesting pluginthat assist developers who use Visual Studio</a> when building web or mobile applications using APIs.</p>
<p>In an effort to make developers lives easier, the <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a1166718-a2d9-4a48-a5fd-504ff4ad1b65">Bing Developer Assistant</a> now comes with integrated API code search that, <em>&ldquo;while coding, a relevant code snippet related to your current API will be automatically displayed in the IntelliSense window which is powered by Bing Code Search"</em>.</p>
<p><em>"Code snippets are short piece of code that you can easily learn and copy"</em>, and you can <em>"copy the code, or click the source URL to view where the code snippet comes from, or click "Search More" to find more code samples related to the API"</em>.  Which seems like it could easily be extended to other aspects of the API, using <a href="http://apisjson.org/2014/07/09/the-power-in-api-discovery-for-apisjson-will-be-in-the-api-url-type/">APIs.json url type</a>, allowing for the discovery of videos, how-to, and other supporting API resources.</p>
<p>The approach by the Bing Developer Center team&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/expanding-the-layer-of-api-discovery-from-within-the-developers-ide/">reflects what I&rsquo;m seeing from Salesforce, Google, and other API IDE integrations</a>. I&rsquo;m interested in continuing to explore what role API definitions like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/16/api-design-do-you-swagger-blueprint-or-raml/">Swagger, API Blueprint, and RAML</a> will play when it comes to API discovery via popular IDEs like Visual Studio.</p>
<p><a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-ide-api.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I also envision <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> also taking a lead role when it comes to discovering new APIs, or pulling from a curated list of existing APIs, while programming within any IDE. There will also be an opportunity for IT, and development support staff to discovery API resources using <a href="http://apis.io">API search engines like APIs.io</a>, and then create their own internal APIs.json collection of sanctioned API resources from across public, partner and internal sources.</p>
<p>IDE API integration isn't something that will just be for the big players like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google. As more API providers publish machine readable API definitions, complete with APIs.json indexes of these resources--we&rsquo;ll begin to see more niche IDE developers who are curating meaningful stacks of API resources from a variety of sources into a single, rich API development experience.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is one of the benefits of where we are currently headed with <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a>.&nbsp;API providers can focus on making machine readable API definitions, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> collections. Then others can innovate in the deployment of tooling like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, and IDE plugins like the Bing Developer Assistant for Microsoft Visual Studio, that make sure API resources are disocvered and put to use in everyday development environments.</p>

<p>I had someone ask me the other day if I had any numbers on how many APIs are used in a modern web or mobile applications--great question! I often refer to the growth in the number of APIs we use, but this is really just anecdotal, and not based on any real facts.</p>
<p>In August, as part of the&nbsp;lead up to&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/APIStrat">@APIStrat</a>&nbsp;I am spending more time reaching out to dev shops in Chicago, with the most recent talks with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/18/how-are-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-bryson-pouw-at-blaze-portfolio/">Bryson Pouw at Blaze Portfolio</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/how-are-mobile-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-dave-devitt-at-sydcon/">Dave Devitt at SYDCON</a>. In future conversation I will make sure and ask the dev shops how many APIs they use in the average app they deliver.</p>
<p>If you have any data on the average number of APIs used in web or mobile apps at your agency, or know of research or stories that talk about this, please let me know.  Until now, many of the numbers being reported in the API space are coming from providers, I think we need to start gathering, tracking on, and reporting on API usage from the API consumption side of the coin.</p>

<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> was designed to be a versatile API discovery format, not just a format for public API discovery via search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. An APIs.json is meant to be a machine readable index of APIs within a single developer hub, providing information on the API endpoints as well as any other supporting resources--there is no reason that all of this can&rsquo;t also be applied in a private setting.</p>
<p>APIs.json can easily be placed within a domain, subdomain, or at any network address, and be used to describe an internal collection of API resources, as well as bring in outside APIs. APIs.jsonbui excels at aggregating multiple, potentially disparate APIs, into a single coherent collection for use in development.</p>
<p>Using internal APIs.json files, a company, organization or governent agency can deploy an instance of an open source API search engine like APIs.io, or develop a custom API search tool that can aggregate the different APIs.json from each location, into a company wide API search and discovery destination.</p>
<p>An APIs.json provides a framework for referencing each APIs machine readable definition in Swagger, API Blueprint or RAML format, as well as other resources that internal developers will need to be successful, such as authentication info, SDKs, terms of service, and the multitude of other <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks</a>.</p>
<p>If you have public APIs, it will be a no brainer for you to generate machine readable API definitions for your APIs, and add them to a single, or potentially multiple <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> files for indexing. Even if you don&rsquo;t have public APis, you can put APIs.json to work improving your internal API discovery, while also opening up your API resources to the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">other benefits of having machine readable API definitions</a>.</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)

<p>I used to publish out a list of curated stories each week, and a listing of the top 25 APIs I was paying attention to during my regular monitoring of the API space to a site I called <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>. When i went to Washington DC last summer as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, I suspended that weekly ritual, and never picked up after my world got back to normal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still monitoring about 1000 companies, with over 2000 total APIs, and curating the stories--I just don&rsquo;t take the time each week to publish them to The API Stack. In an effort to try and reboot the project, provide value to the API Evangelist network, as well as to you my loayal reader, I've republished a new reflection of my work at the Github project. Right now it just lists 819 of the companies who are doing interesting things with APis in 114 categories.</p>
<p>Over the next couple weeks I will be reviewing each of these 819 companies APIs, and as I validate them, I will publish more detail. You can search for General Services Administration (GSA), under the <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=federal-stack">Federal Stack</a> to see an example of this work in action. I link to each of the GSA APIs, across multiple domains, and include a machine readable API definition as well as interactive documentation generated from the definition.</p>
<p>The API Stack will continue to be a window into my API targeting and monitoring, and I will update regularly as I have time. I&rsquo;m a firm believer that going forward, the API space needs to focus on the quality of APIs, and not just the number of APIs available, and <a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a> reflects this way of thinking, playing out in my own work.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/blaze-portfolio/atom-align-blaze-portfolio.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I recently talked with Bryson Pouw (<a href="https://twitter.com/bpouw">@bpouw</a>), Founder / CEO at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com">Blaze Portfolio Systems</a> in Chicago about how his portfolio management and trading technology company sees the world of APIs. Last week <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/how-are-mobile-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-dave-devitt-at-sydcon/">I had talked with Dave Devitt (@sydcon), President at SYDCON, a web development shop</a>, and this week I was very interested to hear Bryson&rsquo;s view on APIs, because his company is a little more niche, focusing specifically on the needs of the investment professional.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com/features/model-rebalancing">Atom Align</a>, the Blaze Portfolio Systems flagship product is looking to help investment professionals better manage their portfolios, and a big enabler of this is the <a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com/atom-align-api">Atom Align API</a>,&nbsp;which provides programmatic access to:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Information Queries</strong> &ndash; Obtain the list of portfolios, orders, brokers, and securities</li>
<li><strong>Trade Orders</strong> &ndash; Place, execute, cancel, and allocate trade orders</li>
<li><strong>Manage Trade Extracts </strong>&ndash; Create and download trade extract file</li>
</ul>
<p>The Atom Align API is only made available to trusted Blaze Portfolio partners and clients upon request, while also being used internally to drive system integrations. This approach to API design, as the core for specialty, or even widely available web and mobile applications, <a href="http://www.blazeportfolio.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-market-graph.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>is the signature of a software development shop that has evolved and realized that a core API stack is essential for internal, as well as external integrations&mdash;APIs aren&rsquo;t just for public consumption when it comes to todays dev shop operations.</p>
<p>Beyond their own internal Atom Align API, Blaze Portfolio also uses several other financial related APIs as part of their core operations. APIs are core to the Atom Align secret sauce, aggregating, refining, and making sense of markets by pulling data and content from multiple API sources, most notably <a href="ttp://www.xignite.com/">financial data from Xignite</a>.  You can&rsquo;t be an investment professional in 2014 without having the right technology in your toolbox, and Blaze Portfolio has done well aggregating financial data from public API sources, into tje tool the pros are needing.</p>
<p>Blaze Portfolio Systems designing, deploying, and managing their own internal APIs, as well as consuming multiple publicly available APIs, provides an interesting blueprint that other software development shops can follow. There is money to be made in managing your own API infrastructure, using the best of breed, publicly available data and API sources--then craft it all into your own API driven software solution that can deliver web, mobile, or even device based solutions for niche or mainstream customers.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time looking for good quality logos to represent the companies I track on and write stories about. I have a certain vision in my head about how I want company listings and detail pages to look across the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>&mdash;something that takes a lot of work.</p>
<p>To support this vision, I spend a lot of time looking for logos. Sometimes you can find them in the header of a website, but often times they are poor quality, not configured to be standalone, or difficult to get at for any number of other reasons--making my work a lot tougher.</p>
<p>I published a new list of 819 companies who are doing interesting things with APIs that I call&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com/">The API Stack</a>. After publishing the project, <a href="https://www.concur.com">Concur</a>, one of the <a href="http://theapistack.com/stack.html?tag=travel-stack">travel API providers</a>&nbsp;listed, tweeted at me asking if I could replace their logo with a better quality one from their <a href="https://www.concur.com/en-us/logos">official logo page</a>--I did so very quickly!</p>
<p>I sure love me a good logo and branding page for an API. It makes my life easier, by giving me a single place to go get high quality logos, without having to open up my image editor. I wish that more API platforms would have a well designed logo page like <a href="https://www.concur.com">Concur</a>.</p>

One of the commonets on the post was&nbsp;from my friend Logan Powell (<a href="https://twitter.com/logantpowell">@logantpowell</a>), and I think it was so good, that it deserves its own post. I will let Logan do the talking:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>To supplement the pool of meaning here, I would like to add that an API-first strategy is one where the API serves as both a pattern of an enterprises IT architecture as well as catalyst for engagement.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In a nutshell, an API-first strategy is a systems paradigm shift</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>-- from a centralized, engineered mechanical system made up of subordinate parts serving as means to deliberately designed ends</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>-- to a decentralized, organic and evolving ecosystem where the individual actors can be spontaneously enfranchised or co-opted by any other actor / set of actors to serve new purposes.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>This allows the system to be more flexible, respond more quickly and behave more dynamically to suit unforeseen purposes. I believe the API-first paradigm is thereby more scalable by nature.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Prudent separation of information from presentation through APIs should be the first and next step for most organizations with large IT infrastructures. To be more specific, this provides a number of efficiency benefits. To just name a few: by modulating infrastructure with solid APIs, stakeholders can create / hack together production-ready applications faster, more securely and more reliably.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This approach warrants a new form of IT team protocol wherein the curation of APIs is front-and-center to their role. When designing a new product / service, the design of it's API should be commensurate. As the product or service makes it's way to production, making sure the API is well documented, easy to use / as conventional as possible, hooked up with analytics, secure and prepared to scale should be a given (these are frequently included in any self-respecting API management solution). In so doing, not only might the enterprise benefit from the speedier and more rewarding 'dog-fooding' of these services / resources, if they ever decide to commercialize or publicize / open them up to users outside their organization (the decision to flip the switch itself being informed by the aforementioned analytics), it's just an invite / key request away.</em></p>
<p>Logan works in the federal government, on some pretty high value open data and API projects, and he is on the frontline for how APIs can be a catalyst for change within enterprise IT, but also connect externally in some meaningful ways--in short he knows his stuff, and is helping internalize APIs across the federal government.</p>
<p>What Logan describes IS why I believe so paassionately in APIs. In my mind It is the culural change, with an eye towards exernal interactions and conversations that make APIs work, and while the tech of APIs is critical, it is the cultural, organizational, and ultimately the human aspects of APIs that make the biggest impact.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/trade-gov/trade-gov-developer-portal.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/14/swagger-apisjson-and-review-for-the-new-developertradegov/">coordinating with the development team for Developer.Trade.Gov today</a>, providing them with a review of their new developer area, and some suggestions on how to make their APIs, and developer more usable.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a> is published as a <a href="https://github.com/InternationalTradeAdministration/developerportal">Github repository</a>, using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to actually deliver the website. The feedback I&rsquo;ve been giving to the team, has been done through the <a href="https://github.com/InternationalTradeAdministration/developerportal/issues">Github issue management for the repository</a>.</p>
<p>One piece of feedback I left was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I love that when I land on your home page, I get a brief description of what developer.trade.gov delivers, the probem is that the description is below the fold on some monitors, leaving just the 3 links available to see.</em></p>
<p><em>I'd switch the description and links, putting description at the top....and the first thing your eyes are drawn to. You'd be surprised how valuable this can be. Simple, but important.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I submitted&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/InternationalTradeAdministration/developerportal/issues/20#issue-40274346">the suggestion 5 hours ago</a>, and I just received an update that the issue was closed, and my suggestions were incorporated. When you go to the <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">Developer.Trade.Gov</a> website now, you will see the text, with links to the right&mdash;creating a much more clean, informative, and usable way to deliver the most valuable real estate you have in your developer hub. It was a small, but quick and meaningful change to a government website.</p>
<p>Imagine if we could help other agencies see the benefit of publishing small, simple websites, developer hubs, single page apps, and other projects to Github, and manage their feedback loops via Github issues. What types of improvements in delivering government services would we see? What cost savings could be realized across government?</p>
