{% include JB/setup %}<p>I’m working on some more stories around municipal data APIs, based upon two stories I found recently, where developers took it upon themselves to scrape data, launch APIs, and build mobile tools around local municipal transit data: Madison Transit API - Greg Tracy of Madison, WI has a great story on his journey to build a simple SMS app and ended building an entire API. Greg wanted an SMS app that could deliver real-time arrival estimates, to meet his needs as a commuter. After much pain scraping the Madison Transit site for data, he felt he should prevent others from having to do the same, and published an API around his data. But Greg also wanted to find a way to contribute to the larger mission of opening up a public dataset to make it more accessible, opening up opportunities for his communities to operate more efficiently.Swedish Train API - Erik Pettersson did the same thing in Sweden.</p>
