<p><a href="https://schema.org/logo"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_02_10_at_11.56.17_am.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></a>
<p>I spend a lot of time looking for logos of the companies that I write about. A lack of consistency around how companies manage (or don't) their logos, and make them available (or don't) regularly frustrates the hell out of me. While doing my regular work I found myself Googling for the Schema.org logl -- what came up made me smile.
<p>When you Google for Schema.org logo you don't get the logo for Schema.org, <a href="https://schema.org/logo">you get the schema for a logo</a>, which is the image property of a thing&nbsp;and is used by brands, organizations, places, products, and services. I still had to actually do a separate search to find the Schema.org logo, but it did make me smile, and make me think even deeper about how we manage (or don't) our bits online.
<p><a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org is so important</a>. It keeps popping up on my radar, and I'm seeing more examples of it being used as part of JSON-LD API and web search implementations. As I work on my <a href="http://openreferral.org/">human services data specification&nbsp;(HSDS)</a> project I'm going to carve off time to weave JSON-LD and Schema.org into my storytelling. I can't just show people Schema.org and expect them to understand the importance, I'm going to have to show them with meaningful examples of it working out in the wild.
