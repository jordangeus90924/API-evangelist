{% include JB/setup %}<p>Someone asked me about APIs dealing with water and utilities a couple weeks ago. So I dove in to see what I could find related to APIs for city, county and state water management.First I came cross, what sees like a pretty good model for city water services with the Wellington NZ City Water Service Pipes. The Wellington Water Service API provides programmatic access to water and drainage data to assist in planning works that are in proximity to water and drainage infrastructure.Next the Emery Water Conservancy District in central Utah provides sensor data from weather, canal, reservoir, pond and river monitoring sites via the MetriDyne API.</p>
