<p>I like asking questions on Twitter then leaving and coming back to see the great answers people leave. Sometimes I get crickets, but depending on how I phrase the question, and how people interpret my question, I might get a stream of interesting views of the world of APIs. I recently asked a simple question. What is your API lifecycle? This is one of the ubiquitous phrases that we use in the API space that has no concrete definition and means many different things to many different people. I was sitting on a call listening to a conversation, and figured I'd tweet and ask folks what their perspective was.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What is your API lifecycle? Mine is, design, mock, document, test, deploy, manage, SDKs, secure, performance, monitor, evangelize.</p>&mdash; API Evangelist (@apievangelist) <a href="https://twitter.com/apievangelist/status/1364632813643853824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I really like Mike's view of the API lifecycle, but more importantly how he "codifies" his lifecycle. It isn't just about a linear set of stops along a lifecycle, and more about a healthy loop you can use to bring APIs to life.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">/* w/ repeating interations */<br>/* exit-any b4 deploy */<br>/* YMMV */<br>do { <br> explore,<br> select,<br> model,<br> design, <br> describe,<br> sketch,<br> prototype,<br> build,<br> document,<br> test,<br> secure,<br> deploy<br>} until {<br> freeze,<br> redirect,<br> deprecate,<br> donate<br>}<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/API360?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#API360</a></p>&mdash; Mike Amundsen (@mamund) <a href="https://twitter.com/mamund/status/1364736525762781185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Then Mike v2.0 chimes in with his honest and precise view of the landscape and how all of this truly works, introducing one of the most important stops along a modern API lifecycle--regret.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One I see often is develop, deploy, document, regret, forget, sunset.</p>&mdash; Mike Ralphson (@PermittedSoc) <a href="https://twitter.com/PermittedSoc/status/1364652554450329606?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Then Mike v3.0 jumps in with a design heavy view of the lifecycle that occurs between human beings. Mike makes it more like having a conversation about what is needed, then quickly deprecating and deleting.</p>
