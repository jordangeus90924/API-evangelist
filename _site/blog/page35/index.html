<p><a href="http://theapistack.com/">I am working to craft complete Swagger definitions for the 1000 companies in my API Stack</a>, and what better place to start than with the APIs that I actually use on a daily basis. I am working hard to make sure all the APIs for my own <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">master API stack</a> are as complete as possible, but taking inventory of the public APIs that I depend on also makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/14/the-apis-i-depend-on-to-run-api-evangelist/">I've long kept a list of APIs that I use, for IT purposes</a>, but I don't have a complete profile of all of these services. As with any vendo, I should have a complete profile of the APIs I depend on, with relevant support channels, documentation, code samples, monitors, and some of the other essentials I track on for other APIs in the space.</p>
<p>This is all a work in progress, <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">that is published as its own Github Pages hosted API Evangelist research project</a>, but here are the 30+ APIs I have on my list:</p>

<p>As I am doing with the rest of the APIs in my stack, I am profiling each of these company's API operations, down to the underlying data model. My goal is to establish a complete profile of the operations using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, as well as each endpoint, using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to my own internal, master stack of APIs, I will break each API down into the smallest possible unit of value, and generate Postman Collections, link to SDKs.io SDKs, API Science monitors, and other essentials of API integration. At the very least, I now have a coherent list of APIs I depend on for my business, something that in my opinion, every company should have in 2015.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-tools.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>As part of my monitoring of the API space, I keep track of new posts on <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/">CodeProject</a>, and occasionally I come across an API integration project. Some of the times it references it as an API project, while most of the time it will just reference the platform being used, like a Magento Commerce project, or a Youtube project.</p>
<p>As I was reviewing a couple of interesting projects this week, I was thinking it would be nice to have a more modern, simpler version of CodeProject, but exclusively dedicated to APIs. The site could provide regular walk-through of API <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/">integration</a>, <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">aggregation</a>, or <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">reciprocity</a> patterns. The site wouldn't have to do that many projects, just a couple a month would be fine to begin with, increasing the volume after things get going.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another important feature would be the ability browse project by API provider, so you could find all the Twitter how-tos, or the Instagram how-to. The site would use Github to host each how-to, providing a simple, forkable way for API projects to submitting for inclusion by the community, while also empowering the audience to take each how-to-project with them.</p>
<p>I would totally love to do this idea, but I need another project like I need a hold in my head (any new ones). I would surely support anyone who setup a site like this, provide how-to, and help get the word out about it. ;-) I think you could easily monetize by getting paid to do how-to for specific APIs, and within specific business uses cases and industries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alighty, idea share, back to work.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jun 2015</span>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/22/apimatic-adds-new-api-validation-endpoint-to-their-api-client-code-generation-api-stack/">I wrote a story yesterday about APIMATIC releasing a new API validation API to compliment their existing API client code generation API</a>. I received an email from the APIMATIC team is how I found out about the API, but as I'm processing that story, and thoughts around what I'd like to see for <a href="https://www.apichangelog.com/">API Changelog</a> (something Paul of <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockSpring">@BlockSpring</a> brought up), I'm lefting thinking about how antiquated our whole world of API discovery is.</p>
<p>As soon as APIMATIC updated their API Blueprint file, all who use APIMATIC, and us API pundits (clowns) in the space should, should receive a push notification. This type of notification is exactly what API Changelog does, but it does it based upon a document diff, rather than finer grain, machine readable detail like what is available in a Swagger or API Blueprint definition. This is something I know they are working on changing, using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using APIs.json, companies like APIMATIC can publish a machine readable index of API operations in a "known location", aka the root of their domain--in this case, it would be at http://apimatic.io/apis.json. This index lists all of the APIs, and their supporting elements, in a machine readable way, that companies like API Changelog could parse, and provide notification to API consumers, and the pundits like me--providing us with fine grain notifications like, change to existing API, addition of new API, or changes to parameters, data model, etc.</p>
<p>I know API Changelog is working on all of this, but I wanted to recount, to keep the topic fresh in my head, and also acknowledge that one of the problems in all of this, is the initial discovery. API Changelog is good at tracking on known or existing APIs, but how do you find new APIs? This is a very manual process, but when you can just introduce a list of URLs, and look for APIs.json--the API discovery game will improve significantly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When any service like API Changelog, or even API Science, or APIMATIC finds a new APIs.json file, they are immediately made aware of vital metadata about API operations like the name, description, tags, and contact info, but also are given access to other machine readable building blocks like Swagger, API Blueprint, Postman Collections, which give us even deeper insight into API operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someday, I will just get a simple notification via my API design workspace (aka IDE), via email, Twitter, or maybe even Github, that a new API exists, for the companies I already track on, as well as any knew companies I may be interested in learning about--of course these new APIs will fit some definition of what I look for not just in API design, but also other aspects of operation like licensing, pricing, and what SDKs are available.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/04/what-do-i-mean-when-i-say-apis-are-just-the-next-step-in-the-evolution-of-the-web/">I wrote about the Global Change Information System (GCIS) API earlier this year, and how they what they are doing with their API design represent how APIs are the next step in the evolution of the web</a>. If you have the time, go look at what they have done, it is mind-blowing. I am on their email newsletter, and have had their latest update in my inbox for a few days, with some thoughts attached to it I wanted to blog about, before I archived the email.</p>
<p>I love that they provide updates like this via email, but ultimately this story is about how they are iterating on their API design, making it much more useful, and powerful along the way&mdash;with some elements I&rsquo;d like to see spread across other content and document based APIs. Maybe I should backup, and clarify what GCIS does. The platform <em>&ldquo;use identifiers and semantic information to provide points of reference and traceability&rdquo;</em> across the research from 13 US federal agencies, that researchers, citizen scientists, application developers or information theorists can put to work for them.</p>
<p>With their latest release, GCIS provide a very approach to the relationship between publications and its references, enabling some interesting ways of getting at the information contained within publications. First, with any publication you can append /reference to any publication in the API, and receive a list of any references for the publication. For me, where things start getting cool, is that you can then also apply the same to a specific chapter in the publication, or even down to a particular figure.</p>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;m trying to establish in a coherent way in my own systems. I&rsquo;m looking to apply this line of thinking beyond just references, and also make it work for specific companies, tooling, and what I consider to be common building blocks for each area of the API space I track on. Keeping an eye on projects like GCIS make my research such a valuable are of my operations, allowing me to learn from the companies, organizations, and government agencies that I monitor, and apply best practices across them to my own projects.</p>
<p>In my opinion there are two parts to this story: 1) The API design lessons around what GCIS team is doing by providing publication level references via their API (in JSON and YAML), while also breaking it down to chapter and figure levels, and 2) the fact that they communicate the story to their community via the email newsletter--personally I&rsquo;d also like to see more blogging, and tweeting about it as well, but I&rsquo;m happy just to get what I get.</p>
<p>The more I learn from the API space, the more I realize how much my own API design abilities need to improve.</p>

<p>I am <a href="http://restlet.com/summer-of-apis/">partnering with the Restlet team to put on a Summer of APIs, a virtual API challenge</a>. The goal with this summer program isn't to build apps on top of APIs, but build APIs that anyone can use, by crunching some valuable information resource, and make it easier to use in web and mobile, as well as potentially in embeddable tools, and even in spreadsheets--using APIs.</p>
<p>I've gathered up some valuable sources of data, ranging from industry datasets from Data.gov in Washington DC to data sets that can help us with the water crisis out in California, which is included in detail about the program. I did a little homework for you, but dont' feel like you have to stop there, you can make any data, content, or other digital resource into an API during the Summer of APIs.</p>
<p>With the summer of APIs we want bring awareness to the API design, deployment, and management tools that <a href="http://restlet.com">Restlet</a> brings to the table, but we also want to increase the number of valuable APis out there, and potentially make a bigger impact. You'd be surprised how the right access to election data could shift an election, or the availability of health inspection data could save lives--so put some thought into the change you'd like to see.</p>
<p>The Summer of APIs is not just for developers. Using Restlets API Spark platform, just about anyone can design, deploy, and manage APIs--without knowing how to program. All you need is a healthy curiosity about how to work with data, and make the time to learn the API Spark interface which walks you through everything you'll need to import the data, develop the APIs, and manage them. It doesn't hurt to have some coding expertise, but not a requirement.</p>
<p><a href="http://restlet.com/summer-of-apis/">Head over to the Restlet Summer of Code website for all the details</a>. If you need ideas for projects, feel free to tweet at me (<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a>)--I have lots of ideas to share! I look forward to reviewing your projects this fall, and see the valuable APIs you bring to the table. Thanks for getting involved, and working to make change through APIs with Restlet and API Evangelist.</p>

<p>I am working hard to <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">establish a complete set of APIs for my own API stack</a> which includes establishing complete Swagger definitions for the 25 APIs that I personally operate. These Swagger definitions are then used to generate <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/04/07/including-postman-collections-in-my-apisjson-files/">Postman Collections</a>, <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-apimatic-sdks-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">APIMATIC SDKs</a>, and <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-api-science-monitors-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">API Science monitors</a>. I am also <a href="http://theapistack.com/">working hard to establish complete Swagger definitions for the 1000 companies in my API Stack</a>, something I am partnering with <a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this work, both teams are working hard to evolve our tooling for working with, and validating API definitions. I mentioned a couple weeks back, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/comparison-of-automatic-api-code-generation-tools-for-swagger/">when I shared client SDK research conducted by APIMATIC,</a> that quality SDK generation is kind of the high water mark for measuring API definition completion--meaning if your API definition isn't complete enough to generate a functional SDK, you need to spend more time in your API design editor, until it is more complete.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/15/my-minimum-viable-definition-for-a-complete-swagger-api-definition/">As I've been working to establish my own definition of what a complete Swagger definition is</a>, APIMATIC has been hard at work doing the same, but applying to&nbsp;WADL, Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, IODocs, and Google Discovery. Also at the same time <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/09/my-new-api-for-asking-questions-of-apis--the-swagger-edition/">I'm building my questions API to help me automate the validation of Swagger definitions</a>, <a href="http://docs.apimatic.apiary.io/#reference/api-description-validation">APIMATIC has been working on their own validation API, which they just added to their existing API client code generation API</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.apimatic.apiary.io">If you are generating machine readable API definitions in&nbsp;WADL, Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, IODocs, or Google Discovery, then you should be validating your API designs using APIMATIC.</a> Once you know your API definitions are solid, then you should also generate all your SDKs with APIMATIC too--I am only about 20% the way through doing this for my API Stack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nice work <a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> team. I predict by the end of the year we will have a full stack of APIs, and tooling, that helps us through almost every step of the API definition driven, API lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15p;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-cherry.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">I create a lot of machine readable API definitions for the 1000 companies I monitor as part of my API Stack</a>. I am using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> to define all of my APIs, providing me with a simple, yet powerful way to profile each of the APIs I'm working to understand better. If you aren't familiar with Swagger, it provides a handful of fields you can use to fill out the metadata profile for APIs, like title, description, etc., but where it really gets powerful is when you put the paths collection to work, outline the details of each endpoint.</p>
<p>Most of the APIs I come across that are defined using Swagger, focuses on providing details on each path, including verbs, headers, parameters, and sometimes response status codes. When looking for the benefits of Swagger, many stop here. With basic metadata, and details about the paths, <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">you can launch interactive documentation using Swagger UI</a>--which is how about 80% of folks are using the API specification format.</p>
<p>When it comes to Swagger, my own motivations are all about <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a>, so when crafting Swagger files for the APIs I track on, I can easily call it quits after defining the basic meta information, and path details, but all of this ignores some of the exremely valuable aspect of using Swagger--with the definitions collection.</p>
<p>Using the Swagger definitions collection you can quantify the underlying data model across API operations, providing a machine readable profile of the XML and JSON that will be part of each API request and response. Once you have the underlying data model defined, including each parameter, description, and type, you can then link to each path and / or parameter, where the data model is being put to use as part of the request or response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swagger definition collections are not a requirement for Swagger UI, or for API discovery currently, but if you want to generate high quality server side code, or client SDKs, you will need a complete set of definitions present. The problem is, this is a shitload of work, and <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/blob/gh-pages/data/twitter/twitter-api-swagger.json">as I face the Swagger definition for Twitter</a>, I'm looking at many hours of work if I want to ensure that Twitter's Swagger file has all of its underlying data model present, understanding why many people stop short of a complete Swagger spec.</p>
<p>In the end, the Swagger definition collections is really the cherry on top of each API I am profiling, highlighting the maturity of a particular API definition, demonstrating that you can do more with a machine readable definition, than just discovery, and documentation.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/charles-proxy-to-swagger.png" alt="Charles Proxy to Swagger" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Making sure the Swagger files I craft possess a complete definition for its underlying data model, one that is linked to each API path, and parameters where it is put to use, is important to me, but damn it is a lot of work. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/21/the-swagger-definitions-collection-is-the-cherry-on-top-of-each-api-that-i-profile/">As I mentioned in my last piece</a> I'm looking at <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/blob/gh-pages/data/twitter/twitter-api-swagger.json">the Twitter Swagger file</a>, and my head starts spinning thinking about how much work it will be to hand-define all of the data models that used across the almost 100 Twitter endpoints.</p>
<p>I quickly got to work finding a better solution--I landed on <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles Proxy</a>. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">I had downloaded and installed Charles Proxy to better understand how we could map out the dark layer of the API universe</a>, that the popular mobile applications we use depend on. When running, Charles proxies all the requests and responses my desktop apps, and browsers make on my local Macbook. I can also route my iPhone and iPad through the proxy, when I want to also record my mobile app usage. This is perfect for helping me map out the public APIs in my API Stack work!</p>
<p>When the Charles Proxy is running, it saves an XML summary export to my local Dropbox folder, which then gets synced to the cloud via the Dropbox API. I am now working on a script that will keep an eye on my Dropbox folder, and process any new Charles export files it finds. As I process each file, I'm cherry picking from the domains of specific companies that I'm tracking on, pulling out the request and response information I need to craft a Swagger definition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To generate the traffic I need, I just load up any API I'm looking to profile in <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>, and started working my way through the list of endpoints, until I've covered the entire surface area of any API. I find it is easy to generate a beginning Swagger definition, which includes the host, base uRL, endpoints, and parameters, then load it into Postman, and let Charles proxy complete the rest of the Swagger definition collection, and link each one to any path or parameter it is referenced by. I will be running checks on request details, to make sure I haven't forgotten about any endpoints, and parameters, but my goal is primarily around polishing the definition collection, with an endpoint linkage.</p>
<p>I will not rely on these Swagger definitions generated from the Charles proxy. I will be queuing them up in a Github repo(s), and syncing them existing, often hand-crafted Swagger definitions I'm already evolving. Hopefully this process will help me automate the profiling of popular public APIs, and enable me to crank through more APIs this summer, as part of my <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack research</a>.</p>
<p>All of this is working out well. My need to automate the defining of underlying data models, reminded me of the dark API work I was already doing with Charles Proxy--something I will spend more time on this summer. I am looking to generate a Swagger definition for each of the desktop apps I use on my MacBook, and the mobile apps I use on my iDevices--stay tuned!</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://codenvy-api-101.apievangelist.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-codenvy-menu.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am playing around with making several stops along the API life cycle more accessible, and machine readable using APIs.json. To help me in my work, I am using&nbsp;<a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">my own API stack</a>&nbsp;as a proving ground, resulting in the&nbsp;<a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/04/07/including-postman-collections-in-my-apisjson-files/">addition of Postman Collections</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-apimatic-sdks-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">APIMATIC SDKs</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-api-science-monitors-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">API Science monitors</a> over the last couple weeks. As I'm working through the 25 APIs I have, and almost 350 endpoints, making sure the Swagger definitions are complete,&nbsp;<a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/08/my-api-service-composition-tiers/">the latest evolution of my API management service composition is applied</a>, APIMATIC SDKs up to date, and API Science monitors are setup, I stumbled across another critical stop along the life cycle--the IDE.</p>
<p><a href="http://codenvy.com">I use Codenvy for my IDE</a>. It allows me to easily manage my numerous APIs, and applications that depend on my APIs, in a single cloud based development environment. The definitions for my API stack, both front and back-end lives on Github, but I use Codenvy work spaces to manage each repo, the runners to design, develop, and test out my APIs, and apps, at various stops along the life cycle. As I was doing my work, I saw how non-linear the life cycle ultimately could be, and how the IDE is a window for several stops I am concerned with along it.</p>
<p>While I am using Codenvy to design, develop, and deploy my own APIs, I am also using to evolve my own educational API integration projects. As part of this work,&nbsp;<a href="http://codenvy-api-101.apievangelist.com/">I am currently developing what I consider an API 101 stack of APIs, a common set of APIs, anyone who is just getting started with API integration would want to learn about</a>--I am starting with the classics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Twilio</li>
<li>Sendgrid&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>I would consider these APIs to be messaging 101, and a good place to start for anyone looking to learn about APIs. While I am building this single <a href="http://codenvy-api-101.apievangelist.com/">general API 101 project</a>, I am looking to craft a number of these, and I don't want to have to do heavy lifting with each project,&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org">so I'm standardizing how I define my projects using APIs.json</a>. Out of <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/">my central API API (directory of APIs I track on)</a>, I am able to generate APIs.json files,&nbsp;<a href="http://theapistack.com">which I use in my API Stack work</a>, something that allows me to also aggregate APIs together into collections, or as I prefer to call them, "API menus".</p>
<p>Each API menu is meant to provide an aggregate view of all the APIs I wish to present as part of a project, and Github along with Codenvy allows me to turn an aggregate "API menu" into an API integration starter project--one that is forkable and sharable. So, back to my API 101 project, I am using APIs.json to aggregate Twitter, Twilio, and Sendgrid into a single project, which I am using as a map to all aspects of API integration across these very separate APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am starting with the essential links, like to each portal, pricing, blog, Twitter, and Github pages. At this point, each project is just an aggregate API directory page, I want it to be more, so I am using APIs.json + Swagger to localize a handful of the important building blocks of any API integration process, such as:</p>
<p><a href="https://codenvy.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/codenvy/codenvy-logo.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interactive Documentation -&nbsp;</strong>Provide aggregate API documentation using Swagger UI, allowing developers to explore all APIs as they learn about them. <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/documentation/">I have done this across all 25 of my APIs, something that needs some performance tuning, but provides a worthwhile aggregate API documentation experience</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Software Development Kits -</strong>&nbsp;Using APIMATIC + SDKs.io I will be localizing relevant SDKs for each API, so if the project is a PHP project, I will include a copy of the PHP SDK.</li>
<li><strong>API Monitoring -</strong>&nbsp;Bring in monitoring data for APIs that I include in the project using API Science. I can setup monitors, and using their API I can regularly pull data, and publish to drive JavaScript visualizations that are part of each project--keeping developers up to date.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually I'd like to bring in other essential elements of API integration, like load testing, security, and other things developers will need, but I needed to start somewhere. I think I will tackle more user friendly items like an API walk-through for developers, and adding in more APIs, before I branch out into actually offering different services. My goal is to have a set of 101 projects that anyone can fork, and use to learn how to get started with API integration, in PHP, Python, Ruby, and Node.js. If I can make sure the projects are APIs.json driven, I can use the open format to provide the&nbsp; backbone for each developers IDE project, in a way that keeps them connected, and in sync with any API changes.</p>
<p>I am sorry this post is so long, and a little rambling, but as I do with all of my work, I'm just trying to make sense of this, and bring some coherence to my work. I see the IDE playing several roles throughout the API lifecycle, from API discovery, to design, and development for the API provider, to potentially a starting point for API consumers to start their own projects, and as critical window throughout their own application development life cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now I am using Codenvy to manage the discovery, design, and development of my own internal APIs, but I also intend on using it as a sort of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">devops version of my API broker visions</a>, where I can easily assemble aggregate views of multiple APIs that can be used to develop a meaningful applications. Imagine assembling all the APIs that will be needed to develop a HIPAA compliant healthcare apps, or to bringing together the stack of valuable API resources a data journalist will need to be successful. My goal is to not just bring together the meta data for multiple APIs into one place, I want to localize documentation, SDKs, monitors, and other critical aspects of API operations as well.</p>
<p>Lots more thoughts to work through, thanks for reading.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-dollar-sign.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p class="p1">I am helping a client work through their monetization strategy for an API deployment service. To help me give me a starting point for the work, I wanted to take a look at a handful of existing service providers, that may not be a perfect match, but somewhat in the same realm--<a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">API deployment</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">For this phase of the work, I looked at six&nbsp;<a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/companies.html">API deployment providers</a>, who in my opinion have a pretty straightforward, modern approach to crafting, publishing, and sharing their pricing. It always amazes me how hard it can be to just find a companies pricing, let alone make sense of it...but I digress, that is another story.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are the API deployment providers I reviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://restlet.com/products/apispark/">API Spark</a></strong>, with 5 pricing tiers, broken down by concurrent connection (based upon IP address), number of APIs, the entity and file storage across APIs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.apitite.net/pricing">APItite</a></strong>, width 3 pricing tiers, broken down by number of APIs, API calls, data transfers, data storage (by row), whether the API is public / unlisted / private, and support</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.instantapi.co/#pricing">InstantAPI</a></strong>, with 1 pricing tier, with incremental add-ons to get more API call volume, broken down just by the number of API calls, with an option to pay for custom domain.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://sheetlabs.com/#/pricing">Sheetlabs</a></strong>, with 3 pricing tiers, broken down by storage, number of queries, spreadsheets, APIs, and users.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://orchestrate.io/#pricing">Orchestrate</a></strong>, with 3 pricing tiers, broken down by number of APIs calls and applications, with options for Service Level Agreement (SLA) and support as well.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://algorithmia.com/pricing">Algorithmia</a></strong>, with 2 pricing tiers, broken down by an equal ratio of credits to API calls. You get 10K credits for free, and can purchase more at 10K per $1.00.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I think these six provide a good test sample to kick of my research. Most of the other API deployment providers didn't have a straightforward pricing model, were open source, or just didn't seem like a good fit. &nbsp;As I looked through these companies approaches to monetization, I see two of the three hard costs of each provider covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage</li>
<li>Bandwidth</li>
</ul>
<p>The only one not present is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"compute"</span>, but in my experience this is usually applied across the other pricing variables, as it is harder to calculate. After the hard costs, some of the obvious elements of API monetization are present:</p>
<ul>
<li>APIs</li>
<li>API Calls</li>
<li>Users</li>
<li>Applications</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the most common elements of API service provider pricing, providing tangible things that users will understand. There were also two additional elements I found, that I would consider less than common, but interesting enough to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connections</li>
<li>Data Storage by Row</li>
</ul>
<p>The "connections "concept introduced by Restlet's APISpark platform is an interesting way to try and quantity the compute used by each API consumer. There were also three other I guess, kind of value-add aspects that were included in pricing packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support</li>
<li>SLA</li>
<li>Public / Private</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the number of APIs, API calls, users, apps, and connections are all just ways for carving up the third hard cost of "compute"--with some profit built in of course. It all gives me a great framework to think about what is important when it comes to crafting a monetization strategy, like the hard costs of compute, storage, and bandwidth, but also provides the tangible elements that potential customers will likely understand, such as the number of APIs, API calls, users, and apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, I am a fan of simple, tiered API pricing, providing a free, $9.99, 19.99, $49.99, $99.99, and onward--kind of like with Restlet's APISpark. Each package should be assembled from all the moving parts identified, both hard costs, and perceived costs that the end-users will get &nbsp;like storage, bandwidth, APIs, API cals, users, apps, etc. In my opinion, each tier should allow purchasing of additional units as needed, as well as being able to scale up and down the plan each month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the providers listed above had a "contact us" or "enterprise" option for pricing. This is an area I'd like to see more transparency around what partnership opportunities there are, as well as potential reseller possibilities--I see no reason why some developers can't achieve credits for bringing in other business. I see the partner and reseller layer of any API, as the key to platform success, in a way that can also become a external marketing vehicle for the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Alrighty. That gives me a good amount of information to the prime the pump around the conversation with my client, as well as help build a foundation for how I can approach future <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/index.html">API monetization</a> strategy discussions. I will incorporate this into my <a href="http://api-pricing.apievangelist.com/">api-pricing strategy</a>, where i am trying to define a machine readable format that can be indexed as part of any APIs, <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json index</a>. I am happy with this as a start, to what I see as a continuing conversation about not just strategies for API monetization, but also API service provider monetization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a> for publishing of my white papers, and I also keep an eye on what they are up to as part of my API monitoring--<a href="https://gumroad.com/api">they have a pretty useful publishing API</a>. During <a href="http://api.report/2015/06/15/weekly-apireport-for-june-15th-2015/">my weekly API.Report this last wee</a>k I came across their&nbsp;<a href="https://gumroad.com/smallproductlab">Gumroad Small Product Lab</a>, a cool idea that I'd like to see happen in more API ecosystems, or maybe even across them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Gumroad the the Small Product Lab is a <em>"mini course, community, launchpad, and contest to remove the unknowns and barriers to getting your work out in the world"</em>--Ten days, ten actionable lessons:</p>
<p><a href="https://gumroad.com/smallproductlab"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/gumroad/gumroad-small-product-labs.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Day 1: Mark your calendars</li>
<li>Day 2: What&rsquo;s your product?</li>
<li>Day 3: Plan it</li>
<li>Day 4: Create a style guide</li>
<li>Day 5: Ready, set, go!</li>
<li>Day 6: Share your process and progress</li>
<li>Day 7: Decoding the pricing puzzle</li>
<li>Day 8: Package it up</li>
<li>Day 9: Prep for launch</li>
<li>Day 10: The launch and onward</li>
</ul>
<p>Gumroad is focusing on their customer base (media publishing), but the format is something I'd love to see occur in API ecosystems, helping developers and API consumers put API resources to work for them. It seems like something API providers could do quarterly, monthly, or some other relevant schedule, that would really help API consumers be more successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea of a Small Product Lab, also seems like something that be done across APIs, help API consumers put multiple APIs to work, in the name of a single objective. This kind of approach seems in line with a lot of the micro service, and micro app discussions I am seeing going on across the landscape--when you learn to tackle projects / products in smaller chunks, the chances for success go up (failure hurts less too). Lots of good lessons to be learned along the way!</p>
<p>Anyways, just shedding light on what is going on in the space, and putting the seeds for other ideas out there. I do not have the time to tackle such a project, but will definitely be here to support API providers who do small product labs within their ecosystems, as well as anyone who wanted to step up and do at a larger level. I am also going to consider adding it to <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">my master list of API management building blocks</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/status/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-science-monitors.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I've long advocated that an <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/status/">API Status page</a>&nbsp;should be&nbsp;a required building block for any API operation. As I work on monitoring for my own <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">master API stack</a>, and as I read stories like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/06/pingometer-keeps-your-uptime-in-the-9s-with-twilio-sms.html">Pingometer Keeps Your Uptime In The 9&rsquo;s With Twilio SMS</a>, I'm thinking we need more that just a simple status report for our APIs.</p>
<p>From an API provider standpoint, we should have a more nuanced view of our API availability, beyond just up or down--something popular API integration service providers like <a href="http://runscope.com">Runscope</a> and <a href="http://apiscience.com">API Science</a> have been saying for a while. If our APIs are publicly available, I'm going to even suggest providers start actively sharing their API monitoring strategy, and resulting data with the ecosystem--something I'm going to also be <a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/adding-api-science-monitors-to-my-master-stack-and-including-in-each-apisjson/">advocating for inclusion in the APIs.json index</a>.</p>
<p>From an API consumer standpoint, you are going to want a real-time awareness about the availability of all the APIs you depend on, and much like the provider standpoint, this view needs to be more nuanced than just whether a service is up or down. Developers need to be making tactical, run-time decisions based upon API monitoring, as well as be able to make longer term strategic decisions about which APIs they depend on, based upon API monitoring exhaust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like Twilio's style for showcasing <a href="https://pingometer.com/">Pingometer</a> as a solution. I'm thinking every API provider should cozy up with an API monitoring service provider for their own needs, while also establishing an approach they can also share with their API consumers, to meet their needs as well. I'm currently adding API Science and Runscope as default building blocks for my API Stack, something you will find indexed as part of each of my services APIs.json file.</p>
<p>I'm working to coherently separate out the benefits API service providers like API Science and Runscope bring to the table for both API providers, and API consumers, in a way that is also in alignment with a common set of building blocks, that everyone involved can benefit from, throughout the API life-cycle.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://sdks.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/sdks-io/sdks-io-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am partnering with <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC</a> to help establish a common set of complete, and validated API definitions for the almost <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">1000 APIs I track on as part of my API Stack</a>. I am using my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/question/">Questions API</a> to identify what work is needed to be done, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/15/my-minimum-viable-definition-for-a-complete-swagger-api-definition/">by asking basic questions about companies, via their APIs.json definition, resulting in quick tasks I can accomplish that help us achieve our goals.</a></p>
<p>A portion of this work, involves making sure that the APIs in my stack are also linked to their <a href="https://sdks.io/">SDKs.io</a> profile. If an API in my stack doesn't have an SDKs.io icon, I know that I either need to search and find it in SDKs.io, or I need to publish a copy of the Swagger definitions I have to APIMATIC, and publish it to SDKs.io--then record the default SDKs.io page in my system, and republish. #hakunamatata</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/sdks-io/sdks-sio-api-stack-icon.png" alt="" align="middle" /></p>
<p>Right now you will only find a handful of SDKs.io on the main listing(AngelList, Google, Eventbrite). I am just declaring that I will be doing this as part of the process moving forward. So keep an eye out for the SDKs.io icon, because it means that SDKs.io is in sync with the API Stack (or shortly will be). <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">For all of my own internal APIs I will be actually generating SDKs using APIMATIC</a>--for the APIs I profile as part of my API Stack work, I'll just make sure things are in sync with SDKs.io.</p>
<p>Another problem you'll notice in this work, is the company vs. API aspect--meaning that some companies have the SDKs.io icon as one of its resource links, while some have it on the API itself. Look at AngelList and Google to see what I mean. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/13/you-gotta-keep-em-separated-breaking-down-apis-into-smaller-swagger-files/">This reflects the micro aspect to API definitions I've talked about before</a>. It is common to look at a single API for each company, but through this work, I am trying to distill it down to the smallest possible unit of valuable possible--maybe eventually separate SDKs for each API, plus one for entire company?? What do you think Adeel and Zeeshan?</p>
<p>I like having SDKs.io profile as a default building block for the APIs I track on. It provides me an incentive for ensuring there is as complete of a machine readable API definition for the API as I possibly can. The presence of an SDKs.io profile does not mean the Swagger definition is complete, I have other ways for certifying that, but when the SDKs.io icon is present I know that an API is further along in the process, and closer to being an API that anyone can quickly integrate with.</p>

<p>In theory, I can run this on any <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> file, and it will return answers for any API that has a valid Swagger file present. My goal is to provide me with a quick action todo list for <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">any API in my API Stac</a>k.</p>
<p>Now I want some sort of way to certify that all these questions were asked, import the Swagger into Postman, or some other tool and actually execute a real call against each endpoint. I'm still evaluating how to record this information somewhere, so it can be verified at any time, but anyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, I have about 50 APis targeted for completion, using my new Questions API. <a href="http://api-questions.apievangelist.com/swagger.html">I even created a simple little widget to ask the questions of each API, something I will automate as soon as possible, and build into my API stack</a>.</p>

<p>I have been talking about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtualized API stacks</a> for a while now, slowly evolving my own view of whats next for the world of APIs, based upon what I'm seeing happen across the sector. I am working hard to convert my own <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">master stack of APIs</a>, in 25+ separate container driven APIs, which I can then orchestrate into other collections for my own use, as well as the needs of my partners, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">wholesale API</a> clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The post&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.dreamfactory.com/running-dreamfactory-as-a-docker-container">Running DreamFactory as a Docker Containers</a> came across my monitors this weekend, which for me is a sign we are getting closer to a version of the API economy that I think will actually scale. The days where you launch one API platform, with one or many APIs, and you only sell that service via a single platform domain, have peaked. The technology, business, and politics of your API operations will have to be flexible enough to be deployed anywhere, by any partner you wish to give access, in a way that maximizes the same innovation we've seen popularize the API movement.</p>
<p>As John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) of <a href="https://www.runscope.com">Runscope</a> says: <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">Containers will do for APIs, what API have done for businesses over the last 15 years</a>.</p>
<p>In 2015 all your APIs need to be modular, and containerized using common approaches like Docker, alowing your API infrastructure to be deploy-able anywhere, anytime. H<a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/02/26/making-my-3scale-api-management-portable-with-a-containerized-microservices/">opefully by now you have your API management and service composition house in order, and the business of your APIs can also scale to meet this new, containerized landscape</a>. If you are worried about discovery in all of this, you better start talking to me about <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and making sure you use a common API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>&nbsp;across all of your APIs.</p>
<p>Just like the early API providers like SalesForce, Amazon, and Twilio were able to out-innovate, and out-maneuver their business competitors using APIs in the last decade, <a href="https://www.dreamfactory.com/">companies who can containerize the approach to their API deployment and management like DreamFactory brings to the table</a>, will realize entirely new levels of agility, and flexibility--in a time when you really, really, really need any competitive advantage you can to stay relevant.</p>

<p>As I work to chase an elusive answer to the question, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/how-do-you-know-when-a-swagger-api-definition-is-complete/">what is a complete API Swagger definition</a>, I'm also faced with what I know John Musser (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>)&nbsp;would agree is the age old question, what exactly constitutes an API? Is it the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">Twitter API</a>, or is it the Twitter account, status, friends, media, etc. APIs? While this has been a tough question, facing anyone who considers API discovery, I think it is a question that is evolving as part of the current microservices conversation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One layer of the microservices onion is focused on breaking down services into their smallest possible unit of value (at least this is one of my takeaways). Doing this is an enabler all the other orchestration, devops, voodoo magic that represent the other architectural layers of the microservices onion. As I work to <a href="http://theapistack.com/">define Swagger definitions for the almost 1000+ companies in my API Stack</a>, I'm working to employ this line of thought, and actively breaking down each API I profile, into the smallest unit possible, using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>.</p>
<p>An example of this in the wild, is with the messaging API from <a href="http://www.tigertext.com/">TigerText</a>, which could easily be a single API Swagger definition called <a href="http://www.tigertext.com/tigerconnect/">TigerConnect API</a>, but after breaking things down I'm left with six separate Swagger files:</p>

<p>Ultimately this is more work for me, but from an API discovery perspective, I'm looking to identify the small, most unique unit of value possible, which allows me to discovery, and organize APIs into extremely precise, yet powerful <span style="text-decoration: underline;">API menus</span>. Right now this is a very manual process, but I'm developing tooling that will help me to "explode" existing Swagger definitions based upon unique API paths--we will see how that goes.</p>
<p>Now I can evaluate TigerText's approach to user APIs, or metadata APIs, without wading through the actual messaging side of the coin. I am not in the business of creating at database of APIs, where my metric is number of APIs--my objective is a database of high quality APIs, where my metric is number of companies, with complete API definitions for resources they provide, and as complete profile of overall API operations as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll see how I feel about this after doing another 500 APIs (I've done almost 500 so far) :-) My tune may change, but I'm hoping to have more tooling that helps me throughout the process. I will never be able to fully automate the creation, or fine tuning of API definitions, but I feel I can automate certain aspects--greasing the gears.</p>

<p>I am working through each of <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">my 25 APIs</a> right now, tackling a list of changes that include some adjustment for an&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/08/my-api-service-composition-tiers/">evolution in my service composition</a>, generating <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections">Postman collections</a>, <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC SDKs</a>, and <a href="https://www.apiscience.com/">API Science monitors</a>--for each API. I was talking through the process of setting up my API monitors, and how I will be <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/status/">generating status pages for each API portal,</a>&nbsp;with John Musser (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>), and he reminded me of the&nbsp;<a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/HAR/Overview.html">HTTP Archive (HAR) format</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HAR is all about providing an archival format for HTTP transactions that can be used by a web browser to export detailed performance data about web pages it loads, which got me thinking about how we can use the existing format to record and quantify the exhaust from our increasing API activity. There are some areas of the HAR specification that wouldn't apply to this, but for the most part, it provides an existing format for collecting, evaluating, and potentially understanding the value we generate (or not) via our APIs in real-time.</p>
<p>As I work through each of the stops along my API lifecycles (Postman Collections, SDKs, monitors, etc), I'm working to make sure the input and output from the stop is indexed as part of the APIs.json collection. <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/api/">In short, you will be able to find the Postman Collections, APIMATIC SDKs, and API Science monitors via the APIs.json index for each of my 25 APIs. </a>Right now APIMATIC SDKs and API Science monitors just link to HTML pages for getting at details, but eventually I am looking to make this detail machine readable as well--this is why John and I started discussing HAR.</p>
<p>To help me wrap my head around possiblities, I wanted to elevate myself and look at the the role HAR could play in the index of my APIs, and potentially the wider industries that I am building <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> collections for. As I look at the core of each of my APIs, Swagger very much represents the value that is possible with each of my APIs, while I see each Postman Collection as a unit of this value that is ready to be executed as a transaction, and HAR has the potential to be the evidence thta this value transaction actually occurred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The introduction of HAR into my APIs.json index provides an import linkage for me, in preparing each API for the API economy. Steve Willmott's and mines objective with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json is to index APIs</a>, preparing them for a more run-time engagement in the API economy, acknowledging we need a full machine readable picutre of what an API resource delivers, ranging from the what that API does, to the cost and licensing of that resources. API definitions like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a> provide an important way to quantify this value pre-transaction, Postman Collections provide the snapshot right at integration or client execution, and HAR could be used a record that this transaction occurred--think of this a trillion times over, in the context of a global API economy.</p>
<p>I will keep working through these thoughts, but I see API economy level potential here, and <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com">even opportunities for evolving the patent process for at least the digital side of the patent equation</a>. Meaning, when you file a patent, diagrams aren't enough in the API economy, you need an API definition showing what is possible, a Postman Colleciton demonstrating it can be run, and a HAR file from a certified provider like API Science, as a timestamp showing that this value was demonstrated on this date and time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, enough geeking out on that, back to preparing for&nbsp;<a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">my Internet of Things talk at API Days San Francisco this week.</a></p>

Only a small portion of APIs I am defining using Swagger will reach an 80-90% completions status, in reality most will never be complete for reasons that are totally out of my control.</p>
<p>When it comes to crafting API definitions for public APIs, I may be able to get the API definition complete in the sense that it has all the paths, parameters, responses, definitions, and security configurations, but if the API itself is missing pieces--the API definition will always be incomplete (in perpetuity).</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/09/my-new-api-for-asking-questions-of-apis--the-swagger-edition/">As I work to automate the questions I ask of Swagger definitions</a>, helping me get to a more <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/how-do-you-know-when-a-swagger-api-definition-is-complete/">coherent definition of what is a complete Swagger definition</a>, I can't help feel the need to offer API design tips to the API providers I am profiling. Honestly I have never considered myself a high quality API designer, I've been more business than tech, but I can't help pointing out the obvious stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still using my API definition tooling for my own goals around defining <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a>, but because I'm building it all as APIs, I intend to open it up to others for analyzing their own API definitions, determining how complete they are, and potentially offering up tips on what could be done to improve them. A kind of self-service, API design tip API, that helps with some of the most common elements that are missing from API designs.</p>
<p>In 2015, API definitions are opening up a buffet of services that are courting API providers ranging from mocking and deployment, to monitoring and security. I don't see why API definitions couldn't also allow for professional API designers to help API providers evolve their APIs in a more constructive ways, from the outside-in. Using Swagger or API Blueprint, professional designers could easily provide suggestions for existing API providers and their designs, then give them potential suggestions that they could use in their API design road-map.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, food for thought!</p>

<p>When I started API Evangelist, I knew I didn't want to use WordPress or other common CMS, so I developed my own API, and page and blogging CMS. During the latest migration of my internal API infrastructure, I'm rebuilding everything as a <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">single stack of APIs</a> that I &nbsp;can use to operate API Evangelist. Part of this process is breaking down legacy systems, into the small possible unit of value, something I consider deeply as I rebuild each API.</p>
<p>It started with my link system, which I broke up into <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/link/">link</a>, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/curated/">curation</a>, <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/keyword/">keyword</a>, and <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/linkrot/">linkrot</a> APIs. Now I'm eyeballing my legacy blog API, which historically I also use to publish news pieces to <a href="http://api.report">API.Report,</a> and sections that I syndicate to white papers I have published. My goal with my blogging API is to get it down to its simplest possible functionality--publishing posts to my blogs.</p>
<p>With this in mind I forked my newer <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/blog/">blog API</a>, and labeled it my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/news/">news API</a>. Right now, my news API behaves very similar to my blog, but it already has new features like automated pulling of press releases, extraction of proper nouns, and a few other bells and whistles that make my news management workflow as painless as possible. Over time I may share some of the features with the blogging API, I think my news and analysis worlds will remain separate beasts, from here forward.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-internet-desktop.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was recently reading about&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2015/05/11/google-moves-its-corporate-applications-to-the-internet/">Google moving its corporate applications to the Internet</a>, and as my brain works, began applying this ine of thinking to the world APIs. I am big advocate for companies being more transparent, and acknowledging that more and more of our ever day business occurs on the open Internet, and we should start treating it like we are.</p>
<p>I think one statement in the Google paper says it well:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The new model &mdash; called the BeyondCorp initiative &mdash; assumes that the internal network is as dangerous as the Internet.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>As the Internet penetrates more of our personal and business lives, the concept of a private, localized, and secure network, is fading. Even if a system is only accessible via a local area network, if any node on that network has Internet access, and delivers resources to web, mobile, and increasingly devices via DNS--it is operating on the open Internet.</p>
<p>I am not saying that we need to put all our private information out on the open Internet, but I know too many organizations who feel pretty confident in their security through obscurity strategies, and that if things are kept hidden, and lightly secured, you are fine. Inversely they also claim that if you push directories of infrastructure out on the web, that you are just giving a map to the bad guys. This all just feels way out of balance to me.</p>
<p>Ultimately I feel like an API first approach for all digital resources is the way to go. Acknowledging that all of these resources will use the open Internet as a transport, and require all systems, web applications, mobile applications, and devices to use the same API--proving a single surface area that a company can secure. With it being publicly available, but secured properly using a sound identity and access management approach, companies can easily bring in external service providers to audit and help secure.</p>
<p>I am not selling this concept as a holy grail, but I wanted to point out that other large companies are thinking along the same lines, and I am looking to plant the seeds that maybe your current belief in the privacy and security of your internal networks isn't as solid as you think. We are seeing more security breaches in recent months, and I think in 2015 we need to start having a more honest conversations about how we operate our infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://cloud-elements.com/element-mapper/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/cloud-elements-element-mapper.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have had <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a> under my <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">API aggregation research</a> for some time now, keeping an eye on what they are up to via their <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/blog/">blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudElements">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/cloud-elements">Github</a> accounts. Cloud Elements takes a handful of top API driven platforms, which they organize into their <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/elements-catalog/">Elements Catalog</a>, aggregating them into a single API driven platform.</p>
<p>API aggregation is something I've been a big supporter of, and API reciprocity as with companies like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, is something I feel compliments how we operate on the open Internet. Today, <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/element-mapper/">Cloud Elements made an interesting move forward with the ability to map new elements</a>, <a href="https://console.cloud-elements.com/elements/jsp/home.jsp#DocumentationElementsPanel">via an API</a>, which in my book moves them more into API reciprocity space, than it does aggregation--meaning you could in theory launch a specialized Zapier, using Cloud Elements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One additional thing that Cloud Elements does that I think is significant, is they aggregate API driven platforms (elements) into meaningful buckets like documents, messaging, CRM, social, and finance. Things that actually mean something to end users. With the Element Mapper, you now map to any API driven resource you need, all via the API, to solve precise business solutions, for specific business groups.</p>
<p>Zapier has an API, but it focuses on the creation of new channels, and opening the potential for recipe development. What I like about Cloud Elements is they bring in the organizational aspect of it all as well, helping you establish some order. Establishing a stack of the APIs you depend on for your business, while organizing them in a meaningful and coherent way--all via an API. #Wining</p>
<p>It makes me happy to see a provider like Cloud Elements doing what they do. I've seen a lot of aggregation and interoperability API service providers come and go (Yahoo Pipes, cough cough!!) I like the approach Cloud Elements is taking. They are paying it forward in my opinion, meaning they are building value on top of existing APIs, using a wide variety of publicly available APIs, while also allowing API access to everything you can do with their Cloud Elements platform.</p>
<p>I will make time to play with Cloud Elements more, and compare it with some of my more manual approaches to API aggregation, and reciprocity. I actually can picture what Cloud Elements is doing becoming a very common model for how IT operates on the open Internet in the near future.</p>

<p>Much of this I could easily do with the JSON schema for Swagger, but I'm working on some more nuance to it, something eventually I'd like to evolve into an API design guide. Right now, I'm just trying to establish how complete any Swagger definition is programmatically, and queue up the API definitions that need work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've created a <a href="http://question.api.kinlane.com/questions/">simple API for management of my API related questions</a>, then I created <a href="http://question.api.kinlane.com/questions/ask/organization/?apisjson_url=https://kin-lane.github.io/api/apis.json&amp;questions=46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73">another API for asking these questions of specific Swagger files</a>. However if you want to use this API, you need an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> index for your APIs, which all of mine in the API stack do--then it will spider any indexed Swagger files, and do its best to answer the 25+ questions above, and return specific answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results are far from perfect, but it is a start. I will be making the questions more precise, and adding new questions. I hope to get more intelligent with things like status code recommendations, and linkage between the API paths and underlying data models. My goal is to have a real-time way of telling how complete my Swagger files are, and where the work is that needs to be done--as I am doing the work.</p>
<p>I'm sure the definition of exactly what is a complete Swagger definition is will continue to evolve, always resulting in a human having the final vote, but for now I will just keep defining, until I find the right balance between programmatic, and the human touch.</p>

<p>I am slowly getting my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">new API stack</a> in order, where I am close to opening it up for access to a wider audience. As part of this last round of work, I'm fine tuning my service composition strategy a little more. If you aren't familiar with API service composition, it is just about creating different levels of access to your APIs, and using my <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale API infrastructure</a> I can easily break this down.</p>
<p>The most common approach to API service composition you see out there is public and private, with maybe an additional partner tier. I'm taking a slightly different approach to defining my layers, and so far, her is what I have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open</strong> - The completely open layer to my APIs that doesn't require any keys at all, like my website, but JSON.</li>
<li><strong>Retail</strong> - The retail storefront to my API operations that anyone can sign up for, and begin consuming my resources.</li>
<li><strong>Trusted</strong> - Same access to resources as my retail layer, but given higher rates of access to be able to make more calls.</li>
<li><strong>Wholesale</strong> - APIs from my stack, but running in someone elses infrastructure, alongside their own APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Partner</strong> - Access to almost all of my APIs, giving higher levels of responsibility for my partners in crime.</li>
<li><strong>Platform</strong> - The highest level access, giving my systems and applications the ability to get the resources they need.</li>
<li><strong>Personal</strong> - A private access level, giving me a layer across all my systems that is only for me to access.</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost all of my API consumers will begin as a retail user, and either stay there, or evolve into one of the other tiers. In the end I can custom tailor access to any of my users, and their applications, but I prefer establish specific layers for users to exist in--giving me clear security groups, that are also in alignment with my business goals.</p>
<p>My service composition approach will most likely stay staty static for a while now, as I play with a credit system that I can use for accessing different resourcs. Right now all APIs use the same unit of value for each API call, something I want to change. I am looking to develop a metering system that puts my 3Scale infrastructure to use, allowing me to maximize the value of each individual APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-swagger-round-certified.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I go through <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/06/comparison-of-automatic-api-code-generation-tools-for-swagger/">the research from APIMATIC regarding automatically generating client code using Swagger</a>, and I prepare to crank out Swagger definitions for almost <a href="http://theapistack.com/">1000 companies in the API Stack</a>, one big question I face is, what exactly is a complete Swagger definition?</p>
<p>An incomplete Swagger definition does you little good. I've gotten away with just mapping out some API endpoints, verbs, and parameters, to add another dimension to my API monitoring, but without authentication details, status codes, and the underlying data model, you can't do much else that is meaningful with them--as the APIMATIC research demonstrates. We need to start refining not just a definition about what is complete, but tooling and services that can help us get to complete as fast as we can, and automate the certification of any API, using Swagger.</p>
<p>I extracted version definition of what is a complete Swagger definition from APIMATIC's research that I recently wrote about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Valid JSON</li>
<li>Correct BaseURIs</li>
<li>Authentication Information</li>
<li>Endpoints</li>
<li>Verbs</li>
<li>Parameters</li>
<li>Schemas</li>
<li>Satus Codes</li>
<li>Data Models</li>
</ul>
<p>I would add that the basic elements of a Swagger specification, while maybe not critical to generating SDKs, are important to discovery, and other aspects of API operations.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Tags</li>
</ul>
<p>Next I would say there is always the human element:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Designer Review </strong>- Sign-off from an API designer who compared the API definition to the actual API, while also rounding off any missing elements, and just giving the API design the love it needs.</li>
<li><strong>API Provider Review -</strong> Sign-off from the actual API provider. This will not be possible for all APIs, but having this is definitely a major score for the overall completion score.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I guess we also need some sort of code level validation an API is complete. I guess this can be done manually during the human API design review, but ideally it would be something a little automated, and potentially generating some output from an API monitoring service provider like <a href="http://runscope.com">Runscope</a> or <a href="http://apiscience.com">API Science</a>--some sort of recent, timestamped output from an actual call that was made to each of the endpoints in a Swagger definition.</p>
<p>Next up, to actually create a walk though of each of the moving parts of a Swagger definition, and create 5-10 Swagger definition that I'd consider to be be 100% complete--something that I'm sure will evolve through the process. If you have additional thoughts on what is a complete Swagger definition, or an example of a Swagger definition, I'd love to hear your thoughts.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://apimatic.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apimatic/apimatic-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have met with the <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC team</a> several times over the last couple weeks to discuss the state of API definitions. If you aren't familiar with <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC, they are a API code as a service provider</a>, that generates high quality client code in several languages, if your APIs are defined using common API definition formats like Swagger (they are also the people behind <a href="http://sdks.io">SDKs.io</a>).&nbsp;APIMATIC is as passionate about high quality Swagger definitions as I am, and have shared some really valuable research to help push forward the API definition conversation.</p>
<p>In May, APIMATIC wanted to compare the quality of automatic code generation tools, using common Swagger specifications they found on Github. To set the bar for their research, APIMATIC established some basic operational parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code generator must support Swagger file format</li>
<li>Only client-side bindings are considered</li>
<li>Must create complete libraries rather than just code snippets</li>
<li>Only the following languages are considered: C#, Java / Android, Objective-C, PHP, Python Ruby</li>
</ul>
<p>While this research focuses on Swagger, I think the findings can be applied when thinking about other API definition formats like API Blueprint or RAML, but kicking things off with a focus on Swagger is wise.  With a basic framework defined, APIMATIC picked four of the leading code generation tools out there currently:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://editor.swagger.io">Swagger CodeGen</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://restunited.com">REST United</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://studio.restlet.com">Restlet Studio</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the decision to look at Swagger CodeGen, REST United, Restlet Studio, and their own APIMATIC solution, they provide a little detail on the code generation engines behind each solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swagger.io is the official host for open source Swagger CodeGen project</li>
<li>REST United uses a customized version of Swagger CodeGen project and performs better than the official branch</li>
<li>Restlet Studio uses Swagger CodeGen for Objective-C, but has its own CodeGen engine for Android and Java</li>
<li>APIMATIC has its own CodeGen engine for all languages</li>
</ul>
<p>They took a sampling of Swagger specifications out of the thousands they found, and did a side by side comparison of how well each of the platforms did with the Swagger definitions, bringing us to the meat of this research, which as APIMATIC states &ldquo;successful compilation does not mean that the SDK will work out of the box!&rdquo;. In short, there are a lot of things to consider when generating code, and APIMATIC helps us see the problems with approaches to code generation, as well as the overall quality of Swagger definitions that are available out there.</p>
<p>Embarrassingly two of the Swagger definitions they used were mine, which I acknowledge are often very incomplete, but they did use others well, including the sample Petstore definition used as demo for Swagger. The message is pretty loud -- the quality of Swagger definitions right now is pretty poor, and while APIMATIC goes a long way to ensure a usable client SDK is generated, they can only do so much with crap Swagger definitions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;APIMATIC looks at some of the tops reasons why the code generated is so bad, resulting in code that often times just will not work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing Authentication Info</li>
<li>Swagger.IO and Restlet Studio do not generate authentication code, even when auth info is available</li>
<li>APIMATIC and REST United support OAuth 1 &amp; 2, Basic Auth, and Custom Headers/Parameters</li>
<li>Missing Schemas/Model definitions</li>
<li>All except APIMATIC use &ldquo;void&rdquo; return type when schemas are missing, meaning all responses are ignored, and no data is returned</li>
</ul>
<p>As they put it, here is APIMATIC&rsquo;s struggle: <em>"SDK&rsquo;s should work out of the box!&nbsp;Generated code often does not work out of the box, AND to make matter even worse, its not even easy to fix by hand.&nbsp;APIMATIC has implemented fallbacks to handle missing schemas and model definitions, but missing auth info cannot be fixed by any fallback measure."</em></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>After you separate the differences in approaches by each code generation engine, it really comes down to a handful of reasons why the Swagger definitions are incomplete--something I see a lot of, as I look for Swagger definitions across the space:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invalid JSON</li>
<li>Missing BaseURIs</li>
<li>Missing Authentication Information</li>
<li>Missing Endpoint OperationIds/NickNames</li>
<li>Missing Schemas/Models</li>
<li>Missing Error Codes/Messages</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the common problems I suffer from with many of my own Swagger definitions, as well as many I discover across the Internet. In my opinion, a complete Swagger definition is more art than tech, and you need the human who really cares about an API to hand finish it. I have many Swagger definitions that are complete, well as complete as the API is, but many I have for public APIs in my API Stack directory, are a work in progress.</p>
<p>APIMATIC also provides three interesting proposal for enhancing Swagger definitions so we can automatically generate more robust code in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for Streaming API</li>
<li>Support for WebHooks</li>
<li>Support for Error Models, not just Error Messages</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is just good API design, the other two are more about additions to the Swagger specification. APIMATIC also provides us with a look at the future, if we get our collective Swagger together, we can realize some serious benefits that will help us throughout the API life cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Naming conventions</li>
<li>Design patterns</li>
<li>Namespaces and packaging</li>
<li>High readability and general formatting</li>
<li>Code comments</li>
<li>Identify redundant and unreachable code</li>
<li>Generate IDE support (Visual Studio, XCode, Android Studio, Eclipse)</li>
<li>Enabled IDE type-hinting (ie. PyCharm, Ruby Mine, Netbeans)</li>
</ul>
<p>I see APIMATIC as just one of many emerging API service providers who live along a Swagger driven API life cycle, but I feel they are one of the most important barometers we have, that we can use to understand the overall health of the Swagger ecosystem. If you can&rsquo;t generate working client code from your Swagger, it is likely you won&rsquo;t be able to mock, test, monitor, or achieve other critical stops along the API life cycle.</p>
<p>Of course, I would be neglectful if I didn&rsquo;t mention that the&nbsp;APIMATIC team is obviously biased, as their motivation is to sell their services. This is true, but APIMATIC is the only player to emerge in the code generation game that I&rsquo;ve seen actually provide a high quality perspective and solution to the problem of client code generation. Look at what they offer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web Interface -</strong> Easy to use interface for managing code generation.</li>
<li><strong>API -</strong> APIMATIC&rsquo;s CGaaS is available as an API.</li>
<li><strong>Multi Definitions - </strong>Accepts API Description (Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint, IO Docs, Google Discovery)</li>
<li><strong>Widgets -</strong> Maintain your API description, and the widget provides fresh SDKs where you need.</li>
<li><strong>APIMATIC On-Prem - </strong>Available as a universal Linux binary - Provides simple locally hosted API.</li>
<li><strong>SmartBear Ready! API Plugin - </strong>Generates SDKs from inside Ready! API.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also known Adeel and Zeeshan, and know they truly care about the health and quality of the API ecosystem, as well as looking to sell the valuable services they bring to the table with APIMATIC and SDKs.io. There is a lot of valuable insights to work with in the research they have started, something I will be contributing to in the future. I will let you review the slide deck from their research below, but I also wanted to point out two addition slides that I thought were interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Statistics for Sources of API Descriptions (Where They Found Definitions)</strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apimatic-api-definition-research-location.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></p>
<p><strong>Statistics for API Descriptions Located (What Format The Definitions Were)</strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apimatic-api-definition-research-type.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></p>
<p>There are two things interesting here, what formats are available, and where are people putting them. I&rsquo;m focused heavily on supporting Swagger and API Blueprint, and often find that discovery and indexing of these definitions is very difficult. I can find definitions on Github fairly easy, but finding them on the open Internet is proving to be more challenging, and resource intensive&mdash;something I will be working with the APIMATIC team on more as well.</p>
<p>The moral of this story is that the Swagger definitions we are creating need to be more complete, and I think it points to the fact that we need more services and tooling to help us validate the completeness of our definitions, something I will also be working with the APIMATIC team on. We need a community driven way to share these API definitions, and as a community to help validate and certify API definitions, and also help complete them when necessary.</p>
<p>I will work with APIMATIC to conduct this research on a regular basis, and is something we are both committed to improving on. In future posts, I&rsquo;ll talk about the work we are doing between APIMATIC, SDKs.io, and my API Stack research, which will provide opportunities for the community to get involved&mdash;so stay tuned.</p>

<p>I recently added a new tool to my hacker storytelling toolbox, that allows me to easily assemble walk through, that help me guide my readers through a scripted series of steps around any of my research areas. <a href="http://api-portal.apievangelist.com/">I first did it to walk through what I'd consider to be my minimum viable developer portal</a>, and now I decided to <a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/">apply to my Swagger research</a>.</p>
<p>I am working on a set of APIs that help me quantify whether a Swagger definition is "complete" or not, to help me tackle my goals around <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack research</a>, and establish a rich set of complete, open API definitions that the community can put to use. What better way to quantify all the moving parts of Swagger, than to actually create a 101 walk through of its moving parts.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/walk-through.html">I added the Swagger walk through to my Swagger research</a>, and will keep refining, and adding more information to it. I've managed to further evolve my definition of what constitutes a complete Swagger definition, allowing me to work towards a somewhat automated, API driven service that will help me understand how complete each Swagger definition in my API stack is, and where the work is that needs to be done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal here is to get <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">all the APIs for 900+ companies in my API Stack fully defined using APIs.json and Swagger</a>, while also establishing a pretty robust set of tools and services for certifying Swagger definitions. If you want to get involved, there is a lot of work to be done, just visit the API Stack, and get involved via the Github repo.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a> and I have been working hard to craft <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> files for the top public APIs out there, including machine readable Swagger definitions, ever since <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">we launched the open source API search engine APIs.io</a>. We will keep working to define, and index the API space, but it is a lot of work ahead, and we could use some help.</p>
<p>Over the last couple months I've had several conversations with folks about the need for <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprints</a> for popular APIs, so that the community can build valuable tooling and services on top of commonly used APIs. Two companies who I've been talking to are&nbsp;<a href="http://apimatic.io">SDK generation service APIMATIC</a>, and <a href="http://blockspring.com">API spreadsheet integration provider BlockSpring</a>.</p>
<p>APIMATC wants see better quality Swagger definitions emerge, so they can build client SDKs that work, and make available via <a href="http://sdks.io">SKDs.io</a>. BlockSpring wants to be able to integrate popular API content, data, and functionality into Google Spreadsheets, using their slick plugin. These are just two examples of services that are emerging to deliver much needed functionality on top of APIs -- if we can establish a rich, open, machine readable repository of API definitions, it will open up the flood gates for even more API tooling and services. #win</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/an-open-source-distributed-api-search-engine/">I've added some new information to the API Stack to support this effort</a>. So far <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">I have&nbsp;917 companies, in 223 areas, with 882 APIs cataloged, and 407 Swagger definitions.</a> I want all 917 companies to have all their APIs fully defined using APIs.json, Swagger, and API Blueprint by the end of the summer, as well as any important companies that are not listed. It is a lofty goal, but I think with some help, we can do it.</p>
<p>As a working group, we have several challenges, that we are hoping to work out in real-time via the <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack">API Stack Github repository</a>. First we have to actually do the heavy lifting of generating APIs.json, Swagger, and API Blueprints, but we also have to also define a process for what is considered a "complete API definition"--I'll be working through these thoughts separately.</p>
<p>Now that I am done traveling, I will be dedicating a considerable amount of time to this work in June. If you want to get involved, <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack">please participate via the API Stack site and Github repository</a>, or feel free to ping me directly. We need all the help we can get, and are looking to have a robust repository of high quality API definitions for 1000+ of the top APIs available today.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://electron.atom.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/electron/electron-editor.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Darrel Miller(<a href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">@darrel_miller</a>) reminded me of the <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">desktop development platform Electron</a> the other day, with his story on <a href="http://blog.runscope.com/posts/moving-beyond-the-browser-with-javascript-and-hypermedia">Moving Beyond the Browser with JavaScript and Hypermedia</a>. I had been eyeballing Electron as a potential candidate for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">my perfect API design editor</a>, something I honestly don't have the bandwidth to build, but is something I enjoy pushing forward in thought.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a>, it is what powers popular desktop version of the apps that I use most--Github, and Slack. The open source desktop framework, developed and maintained Github, allows you to deliver simple, easy to maintain desktop experiences, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript--powered by Chromium and Node.js. Electron is appealing to me because it allows me to use the tech that I am most fluent in, to deliver high quality desktop apps, but also as Darrel mentions in his story, it has the potential to improve on the quality of JavaScript apps we build--giving us C grade JavaScript people a framework to live within. ;-)</p>
<p>I have a pretty clear vision in my head of the API design editor that I would like to see developed. I doubt this will be something I will have the time to develop personally, but I would like to encourage others to develop API design editors using Electron, and encourage a focus on it being extensible, allowing 3rd party, API driven API design features to be added--keeping the editor simple, with almost every feature living as an extension.</p>
<p>I think the API workflow and life-cycle will be different for each API provider, and we need to be able to have the features that we need most, right at our fingertips. <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">Through my profiling of 917 companies, in 223 business sectors, with 882 APIs cataloged, and 407 Swagger definitions so far, I intend to provide API design tips and dictionary functionality based upon popular / successful API designs</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, back the actual work at hand. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">I just wanted to revive these visions of my perfect API design editor</a>, so I can add to, and make sure it is connected with the potential for developing the next killer API design editor, using Electron.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.eater.com/a/one-night-kachka"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/one-night-at-kachka-eater.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Helping people understand the potential you see around a particular approach to API design, is hard stuff. Providing easy to follow stories, and implementations that the average person can follow is something I've dedicated myself to at API Evangelist, and something I'll keep working on when it comes to evolving API approaches like hypermedia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hypermedia has long suffered from an image problem, something I feel can be remedied through a little hacker storytelling on the part of hypermedia API media type owners, API providers who bake hypermedia into their practices, and the developers who are crafting meaningful hypermedia driven experiences. In 2015 I feel like we are getting closer to fixing this, but as I said, this stuff is hard, and takes a lot of work.</p>
<p>Until there are easy to follow stories, and examples of hypermedia in practice, only us in the know are going to care. I see a lot of potential ideas for hypermedia hacker storytelling in my head, but getting these out into stories, and into practice takes a lot of work, and massaging of ideas. One idea that was just moved forward for me, was derived from a post <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">Audrey</a> sent to me today,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eater.com/a/one-night-kachka">a story from Eater, called One Night Kachka</a>.</p>
<p>This approach to storytelling, provides me with a potential blueprint for evolving how I can tell stories using hypermedia APIs, and Single Page Apps (SPA). The Kachka story is full of rich structured data and content, providing a compelling timeline breakdown of a nights activity at a restaurant. There are so many interesting objects here that could be defined and woven together with a hypermedia core--then simply presented via a hypermedia client (aka Single Page App).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally you could generate an administrative SPA, allowing a user to be walked through the process of telling a story, adding the timeline elements, people, pictures, videos, and data around sales and activity--then point user towards the SPA client that allows them to explore the interactive story they just told. This represents an evolution in storytelling around hypermedia for me, where I move from talking about "clients" to talking about a more tangible storytelling SPA, that potentially a wider audience might be able to follow.</p>
<p>What is really beautiful about this model, is an API designer who was skilled in a hypermedia approach like&nbsp;<a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/">Collections+JSON</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>&nbsp;could craft a core that could drive this restaurant experience, but also be flexible enough to tell other similar stories like one night at the club, concert, or maybe just Christmas eve at home with the family. With the SPA client approach, you could easily provide some amazing CSS implementations, <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">using a CSS Zen Garden approach</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Food for thought!<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/11/a-good-example-of-hypermedia-api-using-the-siren-specification/"> I am just now playing with Siren, in redesigning how I tell the story around my API news curation</a>, but once I get my chops up with Siren, HAL, and Collecton+JSON, I may take a crack at assembling a hypermedia core for an API that could drive stories like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eater.com/a/one-night-kachka">One Night Kachka</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/27/a-cleaner-simpler-example-of-api-to-spa/">I wrote about a simpler example of API to SPA the other day, continuing my journey for apps, services, and tooling that easily deploys a Single Page App (SPA) or light-weight web and mobile clients from a single API, or many APIs</a>. One of the reason I am so transparent about my ideas, is because I depend on my audience to help educate me about what is out there--one of my readers, who is always schooling me, pointed me at&nbsp;<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jdubray/reacall/src">Project ReaCall</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jean-Jacques Dubray's (<a href="https://twitter.com/metapgmr">@metapgmr</a>), <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jdubray/reacall/src">Project ReaCall</a> combines <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a> and <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> to make it easier for API providers to develop and evolve API Client SDKs (ACS). This is definitely the direction I'd like to see client SDK and SPA deployment space go. I will have to play with ReaCall more, and I do not have any experience with React.js apps, but it looks pretty easy to bind your API endpoints to specific components in a React.js generated app.</p>
<p>Where this will get even more powerful, is when there are ready to go templates, and starter kits for developer to reverse engineer, and better understand how it works. I see that<a href="http://www.vimoctechnologies.com/">&nbsp;VIMOC Technologies' Landscape-Computing Architecture, and ambient computing API for city infrastructure employes ReaCall for their client deployment</a>. Some more examples, demonstrating common API uses, and real-world client deployments would go a long way in on-boarding people with the approach.</p>
<p><span>The API Evangelist network operates as almost 100 separate Jekyll driven sites / apps (some have more functionality than others), that run on Github Pages. I can easily envision other operators managing hundreds or thousands of sites, sub-sites, web, mobile, and devices based applications that are generated, maintained, and version-ed using the Project ReaCall approach.</span></p>
<p>I'd also like to play around with defining web, mobile, or device application stacks using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, bringing together many disparate APIs into a single collection, and use ReaCall to deploy the application--essentially using APIs.json as the index for where each of the Swagger definitions exist. Adding this to my to-do list, and we'll see if I can manage to float it to the top of my list this summer.</p>

I Am Not!</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 May 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/oracle-v-google/google-v-oracle-solicitor-general-brief-may-2015.pdf"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/oracle-v-google/google-v-oracle-solicitor-general-brief-may-2015.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>My first emotion after reading <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/oracle-v-google/google-v-oracle-solicitor-general-brief-may-2015.pdf">the brief filed by the US Solicitor General</a>, is that the federal government's stance is so wrong, antiquated, and shows how behind the curve our government actually is when it comes to the unfolding API economy around us. Then as with each moment in the past, associated with this very important legal case, I become tangled in the web that is politics and intellectual property (IP) law in our country--leaving me confused, betrayed, and embarrassed for the industry that I take pride in being a champion for. It is easy to get caught up in the page view buzz, emotion, and hype of each of these episodes, but in the end I will just keep fighting for open API patterns, and Oracle's damaging stance, and the fact the federal government is a revolving door for industry, really is just par for the course--business as usual.</p>
<p>This is not the first time, nor will it be the last time, that someone who does not understand APIs will be making laws that regulate how things work in industry. What is really frustrating is that this isn't just a single court case, it sets a very dangerous precedent that will impact every business sectors. Think of the role the web plays in our lives in 2015, and how important companies like SalesForce, eBay, Paypal, Amazon, Google, Twitter, and Facebook have been to the economy--you just dealt a potentially lethal blow to the next wave of these companies even existing, good job US government. The Solicitor General has no idea of the separation in the API layers, but most of the API industry doesn't see it as well, so why would I be surprised that the government isn't up to speed.</p>
<p>Honestly, I cannot argue this case anymore. I do not believe in the bullshit rhetoric in the defense of IP in a digital age, I'm sorry. I'm overwhelmed making sense of the actual reality of the API space, let alone when framed in the context of what everyone owns, who started something first, who has the legal resources to defend (or attack) -- something that actively works against the interoperability that enables the API economy. I cannot allow myself to get bogged down in the legal quagmire that is copyright and patents, when it comes to APIs. Like many other aspects of our world it isn't about right or wrong, open or proprietary, this is about having the resources to be at the table. Period. I am also looking at you Google. Intellectual property is not a poor man's game, or even a slightly well to do man's game--it is a power that the business giants wield to get what they need done--<a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/companies.html">take a look at the companies who have API related patents currently to see who has the power.</a></p>
<p>In the year since I launched <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> I've come to realize that most of you in the API space would rather keep the design of your API close to your chest, because your VCs told you to, or maybe you think that somehow, someday it will be your golden ticket--forget the larger API community. <a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">Similar to the menu sitting on the table at your restaurant, the naming, and order, and design presentation of your API means very different things than you think they do, in reality it is all about the delivery behind this set of instructions, and the overall execution of your platform</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intellectual property laws exists because the space is full of vultures and zombies, and while it may provide some defense for a handful of artists or companies, in the end it really protects those who know how to, and those who have the resources (and fortitude) to wield it. In this new digital world, success is about the widest people possible audience understanding the naming, order, and design of your APIs, not limiting this! Try to scale your restaurant chain without a menu, or suing everyone who has a menu similar to yours, and we aren't even discussing with the critical nature of interoperability which makes APIs a thing, going well beyond what a restaurant menu does. In a digital age you want EVERYONE understanding and re-using the pattern you have designed is essential, not a negative.</p>
<p>This latest flareup in the Oracle v Google case is just a reminder of the larger disease that is government procurement and our IP system, and the federal government is just responding to the powers who are yanking their chain (follow the $$ behind the affordable care act, for a sampling of this). The US Supreme court hasn't even made their decision, the Solicitor General is only keeping things in line with the wider objectives of the administration. This is how power flows, and people are influenced. Oracle, the White House, and even Google do not understand the wider implications of what they are doing, they are just responding as they do, to get the results their constituents desire (no, not you).</p>
<p>Ok, enough bitching. What do we do? We keep on, keep'n on. If you understand the difference between your API and your API design / definition, take a stance--put into the API Commons. If you feel your API definitions are copyrightable, license it API CC-BY or CC0, if you feel your API design is code, the apply an MIT or Apache license, either way make sure people can reuse as they need. I am not saying copyright and patents should be applied--<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am not pro copyright or patent</span>. As I do with much of the API space, I'm just acknowledging the best past forward in the fucked up world we have created for ourselves. The problem with taking this stance, is you still have to have the resources to defend and police whichever position you take. Go ahead and copyright your API design, and patent the API process you deliver, and enjoy defending in court, and policing on the web, rather than actually running your APIs. This is the wonderful API economy we are building for ourselves, a world where us smaller people get to "do", and deliver on meaningful ideas, and the people who have the power will ultimately own the exhaust from all our hard work at some point, either through investment, acquisition, or litigation and regulation--it is inevitable.</p>
<p>I just can't help but think that in this digital age, the copy / paste world we live in now, the only defense we have is&nbsp; doing, and staying ahead through meaningful action and leadership.<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/02/03/apis-are-establishing-new-and-useful-processes-faster-than-patents-can-keep-pace-with/"> The patent system cannot keep up with the pace of change in the API economy</a>, and copyright has to be viewed very differently, this is why we have Creative Commons, something we desperately need for the patent life cycle. This recent brief filed by the Solicitor General is&nbsp; very misguided and damaging, Oracle is hurting their future business with such a short sighted view of the Java API, and I&nbsp; can't keep defending Google on this, or argue within the schizophrenic realm of intellectual property in a digital age. I will keep an eye on it, and undoubtedly have opinions along the way, but I insist on being a lubricant for the API economy, not spending my time being distracted by concepts of IP.</p>
<p>I'm just going to keep building, doing, and sharing the best API stories and patterns I can find. I hope you do as well.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 May 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://roll.space/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/roll-dice.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I enjoy playing with simple, meaningful ways of leaning about APIs. <a href="http://roll.space/">The other day, during the regular monitoring of the API space, I came across a simple dice rolling API, which I decide to map out using Swagger</a>. Shortly after I did &nbsp;this, <a href="https://github.com/alps-io/profiles/blob/master/roll-dice-alps.xml">I saw Mike Amundsen post an ALPS representation of the Dice Rolling API. Around the same time</a>, I then imported my Swagger into my Postman client, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/5a0cbb906697c4f4b8fc">exported a Postman collection</a>.</p>
<p>Once I had the three formats, I sat back to consider what each of these representations mean to me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a></strong> - A map of the surface area that is dice rolling.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a></strong> - A single representation of actions that can be taken--now.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://alps.io/">ALPs</a></strong> - A representations of the what it means to roll the dice.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am constantly working to evolve how I view the available API formats that are emerging throughout the space. I will be spending more time <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">generating machine readable definitions for APIs in my stack</a>, trying to push these definitions through these valuable filters. I do not think any single approach provides me with a definitive view of the resources I am describing, but at least give me with various lenses to look through, during my journey.</p>
<p>Swagger left me feel like I am mapping out a vast expanse, but alone doesn't do much for me without more tooling to interpret the map. Postman left me feeling like I could do one thing, linked to the surface area I mapped with my Swagger, but was very confined to just that specific instance, within the world I have drawn with Swagger. ALPS left me feeling like I described something meaningful, closer to the actual experience of rolling a dice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately I do not see any of the emerging approaches to defining API driven resources as 100% the solution, or in black and white terms as wrong or right. I see Swagger as very much a bridge to a better defined world, while Postman satisfies the more immediate urges that I have, but ALPS...ALPS has the potential to help me internalize, feel, and interact with my digital resources, in a way that is much closer to the real world (not quite, but closer).</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 May 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-single-page-apps.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/">One of my areas of research that got boost of energy at Gluecon last week, was the area of Single Page Applications, aka SPAs</a>. SPAs are one huge area of potential growth for the API space, but like many other areas, they haven't seen the wider, more meaningful deployments, or adoption, that I had hoped for early on. I think up until now the definition of what an SPA is has been heavily dominated by the technical side of things, as opposed to the delivery side--SPA are still mostly about providing solutions for developers, over solutions for the end-user or business owner.</p>
<p>When it comes to SPAs, I stay away from the more established frameworks, opting for a simpler design--minimal platform or framework adoption. Not that solutions like <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> don't do amazing things, just at this point in my career, I'm looking to avoid the adoption, and resulting dogma and dependency that can often come from drinking a specific frameworks kool-aid. I guess the overall footprint needs to be small, before I will allow something to creep my day to day operational world.</p>
<p>While at Gluecon, I was given a demo of a new product, which i won't go into detail about now, but I feel moves us closer to the vision than I have in my head. Many of the existing SPAs employ APIs, but I envision a world where you can design, deploy, and manage APIs, which alongside you can also deploy and manage simple, useful SPAs driven by your valuable API resources. I keep an eye on the SPA space, so I can be in tune with anything that emerges--hopefully my stories and research will also stimulate other solutions in the space as well.</p>
<p>To help you understand the potential for APIs in the SPA space, I am talking about deploying a simple, and I mean as simple as you can SPA deployment, using an API that is defined using a machine readable API definition like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="http://apiblueprint.com">API Blueprint</a>. I want to be able to deploy 10s or 100s of mini sites, landing pages, and apps from a single stack of API resources. API providers, and consumers should be able to easily deploy the SPAs they need, driven by the valuable APIs of their choosing, into the infrastructure they desire, like on Github Pages, Heroku, or their own internal infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some day, we will see the cleaner, simple example of an API to SPA solution, that for now, is trapped in my head. Now that I write about this, I would also think of it as a lightweight, API client, which I'd also like to see be hypermedia compliant--man I am a demanding shit. ;-)&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 May 2015</span>

<p>Yeah, I know, it is a click-bait title. My goal is to not flame the haters, but educate everyone involved, both the people looking to learn about microservices, and those who are practicing microservices, so I'm hoping you will forgive me--my goal is not page views.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/on-apis-and-microservices/">I'm sticking to my goal of not making microservices a regular thing I talk about</a>, but I wanted to share some observations after listening to folks talk at Gluecon last week--a week that was full of microservices love (and hate). In the past, I mentioned that I received a handful of emails, and DMS from folks letting me know I'm not doing microservices, and after Gluecon I think I have a beginning list of why I think people generally are telling me I'm doing it wrong.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tooling</strong> - People tend to identify with the tooling they use, and deeply associate the function with the tool. So if I don't use Puppet or Chef, I'm not orchestrating. If your not using Jenkins, your not doing continous delivery, and so on. This is dangerous for microservices storytelling, but also is something that will continue.</li>
<li><strong>Vendor</strong> - This is probably the most egregious reason I see people telling others they are doing microservices wrong, and is somewhat akin to the tooling item, but is really just rooted in selling you something. You will never do it right, unless you are their customer, so don't worry about it.</li>
<li><strong>Scope</strong> - You just aren't doing it at the scope someone else is doing it. Microservices is something large enterprises do, not small companies, or individuals. You have to be operating across many availability zones, many servers, etc. Horseshit. Microservices can be done at any scope, don't listen to them.</li>
<li><strong>Completeness</strong> - You are only doing some of the aspects of microservices. Maybe you don't need to orchestrate across many operational zones, and your traffic looks very different than some of the usual suspects. Microservices is very seldom a complete picture, it is more about doing what works for you, cherry picking the valuable items you can apply in your world, not any complete definition.</li>
<li><strong>Incomplete Info</strong> - Someone just read a single blog post you wrote, and hasn't been following the series, asked any questions, and just make assumptions about a single thing you wrote. While I feel you should make each post as complete as possible, the responsibility is on the reader to do their homework - Bwahahaha! yeah right, pundits will never do that.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far these are the biggest reasons that I've extracted from people me telling me I am not doing it right. Ultimately it comes down to power and control, which I saw play out with SOA, REST, Linked Data, and other areas of "API". They either want to make you feel small, or not cool because you aren't using the tools they are using, or they just want you to buy their snake oil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, for me, microservices are just a new storytelling package. They are mostly marketing, as many of the skeptics like to point out, and the companies who are truly doing microservices, will care about sharing their real-world stories, and work overtime to help you understand--there are a handful of them out there, like <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a> and <a href="http://www.iron.io/">Iron.io</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, I will be focusing on the moving parts of microservices, which is why you'll see me talking about API design, deployment, management, testing, monitoring, security over just "microservices" umbrella. I could easily attack many of the pundits who challenge me, and say you aren't doing API management, evangelism, monetization, or other critical areas right, but why would I? Where does that get us?</p>
<p>As usual, if you have any questions, let me know how I can help. I'm happy to share, as I try to make sense of all of this. I'm adding some new research sites to support the conversation.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 May 2015</span>
        <p>I am going on five years of API Evangelist this summer, and I've been doing some reflecting about what the next five years will be about. While listening to my friend Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>), I had an idea, that I think I will evolve more during the operations of the next five years of API Evangelist (yes, sorry I'm not going anywhere).</p>
<p>First, I want to clarify that when I started API Evangelist in summer of 2010, I spent a lot of time trying to create a logo, resulting in me creating this temporary (5 years) logo, that you have seen on my t-shirts for the last five years.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/t-shirts/api-evangelist.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p>After listening to Mike spin his yarn, I'm convinced that the next wave of growth for API Evangelist has very little to do with me, and my brand, than it does with the rest of the API community. I've spent a lot of time sharing stories, but for us to get to the next level, it has to be about the community sharing its stories, or we will never get to the scale all of us API delusionaries envision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To support this vision, I'm going to play with a new logo for API Evangelist, and print up a round of t-shirts with this evolution of the logo.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/t-shirts/api-evangelist-next.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p>I know I'll get a lot of flack from the restarfarians, and hypermedia folks about the design, but it is more about the storytelling, than it is about being technical, but in my opinion, they both work in concert. I've often answered, when people ask me what is scale for API Evangelist, that it is about having hundreds of people doing what I do, across many business sectors, around the globe--this new design reflects that.</p>
<p>While this is a marketing effort for my brand, it realyy is about the next phase of growth for the space. To get to that API economy thing we are all showcase across the space, we are going to need API Evangelists to step up and own each sector, region, and country around the globe. API Evangelist isn't something that can scale as a business, it will take people who are passionate to step up in their industries and regions, and help evangelize APIs in a way that isn't about products, but about ideas, stories, and the people and brands who make things go around.</p>
<p>I'll let you know when t-shirts are avaiable, if you'd like to have one let me know, but in exchange you have be the evangelist that is needed in your area--otherwise you will have to wear the reqgular conference schwag you get at conferences and hackathons. ;-)</p>

<p>I look at a lot of API documentation, something that until recently has been pretty static--pun intended. As an API consumer I really appreciate standardized approaches to documenting an API, like using <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="http://apiblueprint.com">API Blueprint</a>, but I also really enjoy when people go the extra mile to add little details, that make the experience a little more fun.</p>
<p>A recent example of this is from the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify API team</a>. When it comes to the search endpoint for the Spotify API, they put in this little addition:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>T<a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item/" target="_blank">he field filter tag:new can be used in album searches to retrieve only albums released in the last two weeks. The field filter tag:hipster can be used in album searches to retrieve only albums with the lowest 10% popularity.</a></em></p>
<p><em>I love shit like this. It makes the often mundane world of APIs, a lttle more bright. It shows that there is a human beneath the very technical story that is often being told as part of API operatoins.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I don't about you, while I enjoy the self-service nature of APIs, where I don't have to deal with people and sales teams to be able to put a valuable resource to usee--I also enoy knowing there is a human behind the scenes. Especially if it someone who cares enough about an API enough to have fun, and enjoy themselves along the way.</p>

<p>While at Gluecon this week, one of the events I particpated in was the Swagger API Meetup, Tuesday evening. There was a small group of Colorado Bros (TM) there, admittedly there "just for the beers", who asked what is Swagger? Valid question, and something I'm always willing to help onboard folks with. First I made sure they knew what an API was, then simply stated, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>"Swagger lets you see the girl in the red dress"</em></span> -- making a Matrix reference, hoping to onboard them with the concept of Swagger, via a familiar movie analogy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/index.html">As I've spent time hand crafting the Swagger definitions for my 25 APIs, which includes almost 350 endpoints, the surface area of my operations have slowly come into focus</a>. Before this, the only visual assistance I had was via any client UI I crafted on top of my APIs. My APIs are so much more than just the single client I had built for them, but this was the reality I had constructed. Swagger allows me to see my API, beyond just the 0s and 1s flying by on my screen, giving me a reference that helps not just see my own APIs, but also potentially share with others, and have a conversation around what is possible with my APIs.</p>
<p>I'll keep working on this Matrix analogy to help people understand what Swagger is. If nothing else it will just open up a deeper conversation about what APis are, and the Swagger brings to the table. The ironic thing about this, and I know that my friend Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>) will agree, is that the girl in the red dress doesn't exist, and in fact API definitons are just a mental crutch, assisting us down a longer road, towards a deeper understanding of how we define our digital self, and the increasingly digital world we live in--I apologize, I get ahead of myself, let me keep with the stories at hand, and not give away future sequels.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 May 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://weather2020.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/wearther2020-globe.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have written many times before <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/21/this-is-how-you-onboard-with-an-api/">about the right way to onboard with an API</a>, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/how-not-to-onboard-with-your-api-fiber-locator-api/">how not to onboard with an API</a>. I see a lot of APIs, and can tell you which APIs have put thought into the process, and those who haven't. Helping companies smooth out the sharp edges on their API onboarding is something I spend a lot of time doing, so I work hard to make sure the topic shows up regularly in my writing.</p>
<p>Today I want to highlight a slight different onboarding email I received from <a href="http://weather2020.com/">Weather2020</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Hi there Mr. Lane!<br /></em><br /><em>First off I'll get my lil bit of gushing out of the way. &nbsp;I really enjoy what you're doing out there in the world. &nbsp;I love your commitment and passion to the growing world and need for APIs and your focus on the narrative vs. straight technical details. &nbsp;So even if you find some reason to hate what we have going on here just please keep up the great work.<br /></em><br /><em>But now without further delay, I generated a key that grants you an unlimited number of calls. &nbsp;That key is: c47c5e6e52ae4ae9183e65f30390693f3ee<br /></em><br /><em>The structure of our API calls are:http://api.weather2020.com/[APIKEY]/[LAT],[LNG]</em><br /><em><br />So a sample functioning call for us here in Kansas City is:<a href="http://api.weather2020.com/c47c5e6e52ae4ae9183e65f30390693f3ee/39.099727,-94.578567">http://api.weather2020.com/<em>c47c5e6e52ae4ae9183e65f30390693f3ee</em>/39.099727,-94.578567</a></em><br /><em><br />Just because you're obviously just a bit of an enthusiast I'll let you know I have 2 other call structures that deliver the forecast data based on zip codes and city names. &nbsp;I use them strictly for our internal purposes but I've enabled your API key to work with them as well. &nbsp;Just in case you want to play around with them. &nbsp;They're not that super impressive but involved a very different kind of internal data mapping so I'm mildly proud of em.http://api.weather2020.com/zip/<em>c47c5e6e52ae4ae9183e65f30390693f3ee</em>/90210http://api.weather2020.com/city/<em>c47c5e6e52ae4ae9183e65f30390693f3ee</em>/Portland,OR</em><br /><em><br />I plan to have some documentation at the root API domain very soon ( ie. here: http://api.weather2020.com ) . &nbsp;So hopefully none of the returned data is too much of a mystery. &nbsp;If you have any questions just let me know. &nbsp;Also if you have any feedback whatsoever I'd love to hear it. &nbsp;I can always use some wisdom!</em><br /><em><br />Enjoy!</em></p>
<p>I do not always read the API signup emails I receive, but I do store them in a folder for later review, and I happen to read this one today. It always makes me happy to receive nice emails from my readers, but the fact that this was also in the form of an API onboarding response--made me smile.</p>
<p>I added a couple random characters to the API key above, so don't worry about the security side of this post. I don't expect everyone to personalize their new developers message like this, but I do think it is helpful to let developers know there is a human behind the self-service registration for any API--it could go a long way.</p>

<p>We use Swagger in a series of on going research projects at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~ckrintz/racelab.html" target="_blank">RACELab</a>&nbsp;of UC Santa Barbara. Our research focuses on designing and implementing new mechanisms for governing APIs in cloud platforms. Following are some of our published works that make use of Swagger.</p>

</ul>
<p>In first two papers, we use Swagger as a mechanism for describing the syntax and semantics of web APIs. The base Swagger standard covers all the crucial syntactic features of the APIs. We extended the base Swagger specification to include some simple axiomatic semantics (API preconditions and postconditions). We use this syntactic and semantic information to measure the similarity between different API alternatives.</p>
<p>In EAGER (Enforced API Governance Engine for REST), we use the base Swagger 1.1 standard to describe all APIs deployed into the cloud. We auto-generate Swagger descriptions from Java (JAXRS) source code at the compile-time using a custom Maven plug-in. Once uploaded to the cloud, we use Swagger descriptions to validate APIs, enforce policies on them and establish the backward compatibility between different versions of the same API. This way we can prevent or warn the API developer when a backward incompatible API change is being rolled out into a production cloud.</p>

<p>As i do with all my work,&nbsp;<a href="http://api-blueprint.apievangelist.com/">I have a Github repository setup for the research</a>, allowing me to publish all of my work publicly, and manage feedback and engagement with the community, using my Github workflow.

<p>So far, I've broken things into four areas:</p>

<p>I know there is a lot more API Blueprint out there, and if you are doing something cool with the API Blueprint specification, there is a good opportunity for it to be included in the discussion next week. If you don't share your story, nobody will know, and there are a huge amount of fence sitters right now when it comes to API definitions--people just waiting, and watching for the right sign to jump in.</p>
<p>I'm going to be writing a lot about API definition formats this week, priming my brain for&nbsp;<a href="http://gluecon.com/">the conversation at Gluecon next week in Colorado</a>. I apologize in advance. ;-) And thanks for sharing your stories!</p>

<p><a href="http://gluecon.com/">I am preparing to head to Colorado next week for Gluecon</a>--one of my can't miss events in the API space. Gluecon is always a great place to be, to discuss the API space with the folks who are leading the charge, but this year is shaping up to be a particularly important one. There are number of things happening this year, primarily focused around API definitions, that stand to have a pretty significant impact on how the space operates.</p>
<p>To help showcase the goings on next week, I wanted to walk through my schedule, which I think speaks for itself. Starting next <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tuesday, May 19th</strong></span>, we have two events:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://apistrat.com/2nd-annual-api-strategy-practice-tech-un-workshops-gluecon-2015/">APIStrat, API Definitions, Design, and The API Lifecycle Workshop from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Swagger-API/events/221572540/">Swagger API Meetup from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Then on the afternoon of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Wednesday May 20th</strong></span>, I am moderating the API session track on the main stage:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">1:30-1:45 -</span></span>&nbsp;Track introduction, <strong>Kin Lane (<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a>)</strong></li>

</ul>
<p>Then after the session <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/29/the-technology-business-and-politics-of-apis-via-a-community-driven-api-life-cycle/">I am doing a keynote on the main stage on the Tech, Business, and Politics of APIs in 2015, where I'll conclude the latest talk I've been doing around where I see the space going, rooted in stories out of the evolution of my own infrastructure</a>. I first gave the talk at 3Scale in Barcelona, continued to evolve for the audience at APIDays Mediterranea, and will conclude with a version of it at Gluecon.</p>
<p>Many of the core people who are working on the Swagger definition will be present at Gluecon, and while much of the conversation will also be about the wider API space, and other API definition formats, there will be some important discussion about the future of Swagger, and what is next for the open API definition format. In addition to the in-person discussion throughout the week, there will be an virtual gathering of the Swagger working group at the end of the week as well.</p>
<p>Another part of the discussion next week will also be around the <a href="http://apisjson.org">API definition format APIs.json</a>, which <a href="http://apisjson.org/2014/05/20/announcing-apisjson-at-gluecon-2014/">since we launched the format last year at Gluecon</a>, it make sense to talk about next steps, and some significant additions to the platform that has occurred in recent weeks. APIs.json, bundled with the potential of leading formats like API Blueprint, and Swagger, are delivering a growing number of services, and tooling to almost every step of the API lifecycle in 2015--Gluecon is where we get together to discuss.</p>
<p>If your are applying API definitions to your API lifecycle currently, I strongly urge you to get to Colorado next week for the discussions. I know it is a week away, but getting to Colorado is pretty easy, and this is a conversation you will not want to miss. As usual Gluecon is proving to be where some of the most important conversations occur, in the halls of the Omni Interlocken, and on the stools in the Taproom--we will see you there.</p>

<p>The Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</p>
<p>I like it when a weekly reports starts with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>101</strong></span>--every week should in my opinion:</p>

<p>That concludes my report on what I read last week across the API space. I'm still working on pulling together a summary e-newsletter version, allowing people to get an executive summary of what I thought was important from the week--I am hoping it will be available next week. I'm also going to auto-generate some visualizations, and summary counts for each week. I'd like to see a tag cloud, and overall counts to help me understand the scope of news I cover each week.</p>
<p>If you know of something I missed, feel free to email or tweet at me, and make sure I know about your company, and have a link to your blog RSS. If you don't tell the story and share, the world will never know it happened.</p>
<p>It is a good time to be tracking on the API space--lots going on!</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 May 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-hypermedia.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I get hypermedia at a high level, but have no real experience designing or deploying a hypermedia API or client. For the longest time I just watched the hypermedia conversation from afar, but in the last year I have spent time learning about the different approaches, but I still have not gone as deep as I'd like. I'm looking to change this over the summer, and begin to add some hypermedia thinking to my own API design.</p>
<p>To get started I've targeted my curation API for the addition of a hypermedia layer, and I'm choosing <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a> as my hypermedia format. Siren spoke to me over some of the other approaches, but once I get my bearings I will look at tackling one or two more implementations. As I do with my other work, I'm just looking to share my thoughts in real-time, as I go along.</p>
<p>First, the process is really helping me tight down my API design. This is something I feel going with an API first design approach using Swagger has helped me, but adding the Siren format to the design of my API is taking this to a whole new level. I still have a longs ways to go in crafting the Siren responses for my curation API, but so far the process of defining the entities, actions, and links is really helping me think through the overall API design--leaving very few loose ends.</p>
<p>Second, the actions and links are also helping me really craft a more meaningful workflow around an API resource that I depend each day. This link curation API that I use in my daily, weekly, and monthly monitoring of the API space has an ever evolving workflow associated with it, but ultimately its been something I've kept in my head, or visualizing in the minmium viable (half-assed) clients I have built to help manage my world. This hypermedia learning process is forcing me to think it through, as if I'm telling the workflow to the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feels very much like storytelling on API Evangelist to me. You see I tell stories to work through my ideas, and craft a nevernding stream of evolving ideas, that help me better understand the world of APis, but also share it in a way that my readers can understand along the way. While applying hypermedia principles to my API design, I feel like I'm working through my API resources in much meaningful ways, and I'm not even approaching what some of the popular benefits of hypermedia are, yet.</p>
<p>I still don't what I am doing entirely, but sure enjoying the process.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 May 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/wurl-api-resources.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am spending a small amount of time each week, adding a new hypermedia layer to my link curation API. My goal is to better understand hypermedia, while also improving the designs of the APIs that I depend on for my own operations. During todays work, I was looking for a more extensive example of <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a> being used by an actual API provider, taking me beyond what Kevin Swiber (<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinswiber">@kevinswiber</a>) provides in his examples.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The example I found that has really helped me go from 0-60 when it comes to Siren (well maybe more like 0-15), was the <a href="http://developers.wurl.com/">TV and streaming video API platform Wurl</a>. The API has a pretty robust example of Siren being used in the wild, allowing me to reverse engineer the design patterns and apply in my own way--this is one way I learn things, through breaking down other people's work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://developers.wurl.com/pages/reference">Wurl has 11 entities defined</a>, demonstrating the really versatile power of Siren in defining the resources an API is serving up. They have some really nice workflows around each video episode, allowing them to be organized into series, bundles, and providing user management and search. For me it is a great introduction into what hypermedia is, and more specifically what Siren offers, in a working, real-world example.</p>
<p>I only have so much bandwidth to spend on this work, but after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/11/applying-a-little-hypermedia-is-helping-me-tighten-down-my-api-design-and-tell-a-better-api-story/">getting my feet wet adding a hypermedia layer link curation API using Siren</a>, and playing with the Wurl API, I've got a lof of new thoughts floating around my head around how I can improve my own API designs, and better present the large amount of information, visualizations, and other information available within my API curation lifecycle.</p>

<p>I'm one day late this week, but got er done--yay!!</p>
<p><span>My Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>

<p>That concludes my report on what I read last week across the API space. I'm still working on pulling together a summary e-newsletter version, allowing people to get an executive summary of what I thought was important from the week--I am hoping it will be available next week. I'm also going to auto-generate some visualizations, and summary counts for each week. I'd like to see a tag cloud, and overall counts to help me understand the scope of news I cover each week.</p>
<p>If you know of something I missed, feel free to email or tweet at me, and make sure I know about your company, and have a link to your blog RSS. If you don't tell the story and share, the world will never know it happened.</p>
<p>It is a good time to be tracking on the API space--lots going on!</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)
