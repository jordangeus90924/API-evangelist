title: About API Evangelist
---
My name is Kin Lane, and I created the API Evangelist blog and persona to provide me with a lens for looking at how technology is impacting the world around us. In 2010, I began studying the business of APIs, trying to understand how new waves of startups like Twilio, Stripe, SendGrid and others were building API-centric businesses. Many years later I am still studying APIs, but my view of the API landscape has significantly changed over the years as I better understand the technology, business, but also the politics of APIs.

In 2019 I joined Postman as the Chief Evangelist. I spent my days leading the Open Technologies team, talking to customers, and working to be the public face of the company when it comes to the API lifecycle. My team is spread across four groups, 1) Developer Advocacy, 2) Lifecycle & Governance, 3) Specifications & Tooling, and 4) Data & Intelligence. I see my team as the frontline for the Postman API platform road map, helping define what our customers and the community needs when it comes to API operations.

This blog is my note pad. It is where I write down my thoughts as I am reading, researching, and having conversation with people across different industries. This blog is how I learn about what is happening with APIs in motion. This blog has no editor, so ocasionally you will find spelling or grammar mistakes. Feel free to share if you come across, or simply overlook as you make your way around. After almost 12 years, I am finding more energy to write here and organize the information I have published here, making things more discoverable and accessable. 

I spend almost a decade working on storytelling here. In the next decade I am looking to apply this knowledge to what I do at Postman. I am looking to get more hands-on with what I've learned and help businesses across many different industries be more successful with their API operations. With a website refresh in the beginning of Octoer 2022 I am looking to invest more time and energy into this blog, organizing what I have here, but working with my team at Postman to help evolve and expand the knowledge available here on API Evangelist.
