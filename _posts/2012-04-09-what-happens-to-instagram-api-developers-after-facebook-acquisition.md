{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was going to write this story when I got an email from Qwerly after they got acquired by Fliptop, then after SimpleGeo was acquired by Urban Airship, then when I got the email from LinkedIn announcing they were shutting down IndexTank.Four acquisitions later, I’m finally making time today after the announcement of Facebook acquiring Instagram.So, what will happen to Instagram API developers, now that Instagram is owned by Facebook?We don’t know.It sounds like Facebook will keep Instagram in tact, but who knows where it will go from here, where founder Kevin Systrom will take it, or Facebook will step in and make changes.</p>
