			<p><em>31 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>Here is the email I received from the CEO of IFTTT, in response to the whole Pinboard kerfuffle, a few minutes ago. It looks like they've done a little soul searching, and wanted to apologize: Hello Pinboard Customers,&nbsp; We've made mistakes over the past few days both in communication and judgment. I'd like to apologize for those mistakes and attempt to explain our intentions. I also pledge to do everything we can to keep Pinboard on IFTTT. IFTTT gives people confidence that the services they love will work together. There are more services in the world than IFTTT can possibly integrate and maintain alone. We are working on a developer platform that solves this by enabling service owners to build and maintain their integration for the benefit of their customers.&nbsp; The vast majority of Channels on IFTTT are now built on that developer platform by the services themselves. We made a mistake in asking Pinboard to migrate without fully explaining the benefits of our developer platform. It's our responsibility to prove that value before asking Pinboard to take ownership of their Channel. We hope to share more on the value of our platform soon. I also want to address Pinboard&rsquo;s concerns with our Developer Terms of Service. These terms were specific to our platform while in private beta and were intended to give us the flexibility to evolve our platform in close partnership with early developers. We&rsquo;ve always planned to update and clarify those terms ahead of opening our platform and we are doing so now. We are specifically changing or removing areas around competing with IFTTT, patents, compatibility and content ownership. The language around content ownership is especially confusing, so I'd like to be very clear on this: as a user of IFTTT you own your content. I truly appreciate all of your feedback, concerns and patience. Helping services work together is what IFTTT does. We respect and appreciate the open web.

			<p><em>31 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I am working on several very rewarding API efforts lately, but one I'm particularly psyched about is Open Referral. I'm working with them to help apply the open API format in a handful of implementations, but to also share some insight on what the platform could be in the future. I have been working to carve out the time for about it, and finally managed to do so this week, resulting in what I am hoping will be some rewarding API work. As i do, I wanted to explore the project, work to understand all the moving parts, as well as what is needed for the future, using my blog. I am not recommending that Open Referral tackle of all this work right now, I am just trying to pull together a framework to think about some of the short, and long terms areas we can invest in together. I intend to continue working with Greg, and the Open Referral team to help spread the awareness of the open API specification, and help build the community. Open Referral is all about being an open specification, dedicated to helping humans find services, and even more humans to help other humans to find the services they need--I can't think of a more worthy implementation of an API. In my opinion, this is what APIs are all about -- providing open access to information, while also allowing for commercial activity. To help prime the pump, let's take a look at the specification, and think more about where I can help, when it comes to the Open Referral organization and eventually, the Open Referral platform. Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) "The Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) defines content that provides the minimum set of data for Information and Referral (I&amp;R) applications as well as specialized service directory applications." &nbsp;Which represents a pretty huge opportunity to help deliver vital information around public services, to those who need them, where they...[<a href="/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I'm engaging in another conversation with a higher education institution about where to start with APIs on campus. A new CIO has assumed a leadership position, and some very forward thinking folks on campus asked me to come visit, talk with IT about APIs, and try to understand where they can get to work with APIs on campus--a perfect opportunity to get to work developing an API culture at&nbsp;Davidson College. As their Twitter profile says, "Davidson is a highly selective independent liberal arts college committed to access and equal opportunity." Sounds like a rich environment to get to work empowering students, teachers, and faculty using APIs. Which leaves at the familiar place of being asked by folks on campus, where do we start with APIs? First we need a place to coordinate the getting started with APIs effort at Davidson with: Creating a Github Repo - To help facilitate the discussion, as well as store any code, data, and content that is generated. Publish a Github Pages - To help provide a web friendly destination to share content, information, and act as public face. Leverage Issue Management - To help establish an asynchronous communication stream around the initial API effort. Second, let's start mapping out all the moving parts, that will be meaningful to APIs on campus: Who Are The Key Stakeholders? What Are The Campus Run Systems Used? What Are The Cloud Services Being Put To Use? What Open Source Software Tools Are Used? What Are The Bits and Bytes That Are Involved? Who Are The Key Individuals Involved With API Efforts? What Is This Low Hanging Fruit On The Public Website? Everyone involved, from IT, to students, including myself can use the Github repo, and the pages setup to support each of these areas, can be used to collectively establish a map of where to begin with APIs. Once a map of all these areas begins to come into focus, individual API opportunities...[<a href="/2016/03/30/where-do-i-start-with-apis-the-independent-liberal-arts-college-edition/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I always dig it when API stories spin out of control, and I end up down story holes. I'm sure certain people waiting for other work from me do not appreciate it, but these are where some of the best stories in my world come from. As I was writing the story about Best Buy limiting access to their API when you have a free email account, which resulted in the story about Best Buy using Medium for their API platform blog presence, which ended up pushing me to read Medium's terms of service.
Anyways, to help manage the evolution of the terms of service, privacy policy, Medum uses Github to establish a historical record of all the changes to all legal documents that impact platform, and API operations. Seems like a pretty sensible, and default approach to the legal department for any platform. Hosting your legal department on Github, making sure their is as much transparency, and logging across this area of operations will play a central role in establishing and maintaining trust with your partners and consumers.
Maintaining the legal side of your platform operations on Github, taking advantage of the version control build in makes a lot of sense. Something that also opens the door for using Github Issue Management, and the other more social aspects of Github for assisting in the communication of legal changes, as well as facilitate ongoing conversations around changes in real time. I can see eventually working this into some sort of rating system for API providers, a sort of open source regulatory consideration, that is totally opt in by API platforms -- if you give a shit you'll do it, if you don't, you won't.&nbsp;

			<p><em>30 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>One thing that struck me as I wrote my post about Best Buy stopping issuing API keys to free email accounts, was the fact that Best Buy operates their developer blog on Medium--something I am seeing more of. As I discover new API-centric companies via my blog, Twitter, Product Hunt, AngelList, and the many other ways I tune into the space, I'm seeing more companies operating the blog portion of their presence in this way.&nbsp; One of voices in my head points out that this just doesn't seem like a good idea. It reminds me of hosting our blogs on Posterous. Medium doesn't let you map your domain, or sub-domain to your blog (invite only), but I'm sure is something they'll do soon. They don't have RSS, and they don't have a read API either? *warning bells* &nbsp;While I get the Medium thing, it seems like one of those neatly tended gardens, where as many roads out are gated off with friendly hand-painted signs. However some of the other voices in my head chimed in that Medium is just asking for non exclusive license to use your content. They let you delete your account, and I know they are working hard on their API strategy. Also, I'm a big supporter of API providers being as scrappy as possible, as many of us have to do as much as we can with some often very non-existent budgets. Best Buy rocks it at leveraging Github, Medium, Twitter, and all the channels I usually recommend. So in the end I really can't bitch about API platforms using Medium for their blog presence. When you use Medium you get the network effect for your blog presence--something I'm working to understand better, and leverage more as part of my own work. I'll keep tracking on the APIs I find that use Medium for their blog presence. Right now my only complaint is simple -- THERE IS NO RSS!!!

			<p><em>30 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>Best Buy is one of the many of the recent responses I am seeing from public API providers, as they work to strike a healthy balance within their API community. In an attempt to incentivize the behavior they desire within the Best Buy API community, the platform will not be issuing API keys to any email address that comes from the popular free email platforms (@google.com, @yahoo.com, etc.). While I hate seeing any public API access be tightened up, I can't help but sympathize with their move, and I have to support any API providers who works to set a healthy balance within their communities. While I am not sure limiting access based upon email account may not be the solution they are looking, they hit all the right notes for me: Develop Human Relationships &gt;&gt; If we want to have a better relationship with you, our active users, we need to make better connections between your alpha-numeric key and the services we provide to you Respect For What You Build &gt;&gt; If we disable a key because the email address is old, we may break an app. We don&rsquo;t like breaking things. Business With Companies &gt;&gt; Over the next couple of months we will transition to a new system that will associate API keys with a company and not an individual. Empowering Education usage &gt;&gt; We are developing a program that we intend to have up and running before the start of the next school year that will accommodate educational use.&nbsp; Allow For Play &amp; Exploration &gt;&gt; Similarly, we have ideas for how to accommodate events, hackathons and developer sandboxes to allow folks to test the waters without needing to go through a formal key sign up process. I will always encourage companies, organizations, institutions, government agencies, and individuals to be as public as possible. More importantly i will always encourage them to do it in the safest, most meaningful way possible, and when...[<a href="/2016/03/30/best-buy-will-not-issue-api-keys-to-free-email-accounts-and-wants-to-get-to-know-your-company/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I am always trying to identify the common building blocks employed by leading API providers, and Twilio is one of the usual suspects I showcase. This time it is focusing their annotated code walk-throughs and tutorials, which provides a pretty good model that other API providers can follow when planning their own tutorials.
Twilio offers up a tutorial for almost every API endpoint they offer. Some of the more popular tutorials have versions for almost every programming language, while some of the lesser traveled ones only have a single version. Once you click in to each tutorial, it delivers as the title implies, an annotated walk through, showing you how to get up and running, making the API call, in the language of choice.
Each tutorials provides you a direct link to the code libaries, available on Twilio's Github account. It can get pretty busy in the walk-through section for Twilio, but the value is clear. I could envision a more portable, embeddable, and machine readable tool, that would help API providers do this as well as Twilio, but maybe in a more cleaner, plug and play way.
I've had tutorials as a common API management building block for some time, maybe I'll take Twilio's model and expand on it, and provide a more detailed blueprint that API providers can follow when planning their own approach. Maybe someone could also turn it into a simple service, or open source solution that the API space could put to use.

			<p><em>28 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was disappointed to see the email in my inbox this morning from IFTTT about their Pinboard integration. I also helped amplify Pinboard when he was Tweet'n up a storm earlier, and I recommend you read his post:&nbsp;My Heroic and Lazy Stand Against IFTTT. However I had work to get done on an essay about the API effort over at Brigham Young University, and prepare for some meetings I have this week around the Open Referral API definition, to help people find government services--IFTTT bums me out, but priorities. The loss of Pinboard integration in IFTTT sucks, but there is always Zapier. ;-)&nbsp;I began moving away from my IFTTT support back in 2014, after I began seeing their lack of an API, and the absence of a forward-facing business model, as an early warning sigs about the sustainability of IFTTT as an service provider. I prefer having the option of paying for services in which I have a growing dependence on for my personal digital presence, and it is vital when it comes to my business presence. This was a deal breaker for me when it comes to IFTTT being a service I could support. I also strongly believe, that if you are building a startup using the APIs of other companies, you should be offering an API for your own aggregation, automation, interoperability, and any other aspect of your tech--otherwise it isn't a service I want to support.&nbsp; There are many other approaches to integrating your cloud services, and the concept of iPaaS is a growing layer of the API space. Unfortunately there will also continue to be incentives for startups to not offer an API, be secretive and shady about their operations, not communicate honestly with their community, and have fucked up terms of services.&nbsp; All we can do to combat this, is to make sure and only use the services who have a sensible business model which is in alignment with their...[<a href="/2016/03/28/the-lack-of-an-api-and-healthy-partner-integrations-is-an-early-warning-system-for-service-providers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>The&nbsp;news out of Runscope&nbsp;makes today&nbsp;a good day to kick off discussion around a project that I've been helping push forward&nbsp;with the API Garage team, assisting them find the healthiest path forward for their API client tooling. As Runscope demonstrates, it is a tough time for API startups, something that adds fuel to my personal mission to do what I can to help startups find success.&nbsp; First, what is API Garage? It is one of the HTTP / Web API Client tools available today, including Postman, Paw, DHC, and Stoplight. API Garage is an Electron based solution, you can download and put to work in helping you integrate with web APIs, allowing you to make calls, see the requests / response, all without having to write code. This approach to working with APIs has evolved beyond use by just API consumers, and is quickly becoming the tool of choice for API development teams, and being applied at almost every stop along the API life cycle. The API Garage team approached me a couple months back to discuss the roadmap, and figure out how we can evolve it beyond just being a web API client, and help it emerge as an "garage environment" where individuals and teams can work on APIs, at any stage of the API life cycle. Inevitably this discussion led us to the talking about how the API Garage would be licensed, and generate revenue to sustain their vision. At this point, the API Garage team expressed interest in open sourcing the solution, and focusing on alternative approaches to generating the money they needed to sustain the solution, and keep them working on meaningful API projects. After a number of conversation, they settled in on open sourcing the API Garage, and begain focusing on revenue being focused on several key areas: Sponsorship - The API Garage website, and the open source download will have a handful of sponsorship spots, ranging from the default home...[<a href="/2016/03/28/exploring-a-new-way-to-fund-api-life-cycle-tooling-by-open-sourcing-the-api-garage/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I recently caught a glimpse of how APIs are going to deliver the change we need in this world. It began while I was attending a gathering of indie ed-tech folks on the campus of Davidson College in North Carolina. Where 20-30, mostly non-developers, discussed what is indie ed-tech, something which included many visions of what was dubbed "the personal API". While the gathering was very enlightening, it was what this gathering has set into motion, after we all parted ways, that I think has the most potential Since the gathering occurred, a rolling wave of API driven awarenss has been picking up speed, with&nbsp;Indie Ed Tech, Colleagues/Friends, APIs, Unexpected Emergent Ideas, and dot dot dot and Can The JED-API Power a Certification with a fellow who barks about and plays with web tech. The&nbsp;Indie Ed-Tech: Revue/Reflections&nbsp;from the ed-tech Cassandra. I&nbsp;took a&nbsp;Journey to discover what is Indie Ed-tech with an expert generalist, and heard about&nbsp;Indie Educational Technology from a university chief information officer (CIO). I then&nbsp;read about how we are&nbsp;Pushing/Pulling Data &ndash; Thinking Computationally? Differently? from someone focused technology integration in K12 and higher ed. Then I&nbsp;explored&nbsp;Lo-fi Ed&rdquo;-&ldquo;Tech and The Personal in Indie from an edupunk with a mountaintop compound in Italy, and enjoyed the&nbsp;Reflections on Indie Ed-Tech from his partner in crime who is&nbsp;someone who is just making things up as he goes. I enjoyed the&nbsp;recap of the #IndieEdTech Design Sprint and #IndieEdTech Personal APIs &amp; The Current State of Ed-Tech&nbsp;and IndieEdTech Keynote Reflections&nbsp;from&nbsp;an instructional psychology and technology graduate student. I thoroughly enjoyed&nbsp;the&nbsp;Framing Indie EdTech and Indie EdTech Design Sprint and Indie EdTech: Future and Funding and finally listening to the&nbsp;Vinyl API of One&rsquo;s Own from a director of digital learning. This collective vision of Indie Ed-Tech, which includes some very personal views of a what an API is, is how APIs will deliver the change we need. It will not be the e-commerce vision of SalesForce, eBay, Commerce, Paypal, and other API pioneers...[<a href="/2016/03/27/this-is-how-apis-will-deliver-the-change-we-need/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>History is everything. Understanding where we have come from is critical to knowing where we are going. While pushing forward with the latest technology, it is always healthy to pause and take a look at that past. Someone Tweeted the link to my history page, and I realize it has been three years since I refreshed my view of the overall history of the space, so I wanted to take some time and add a few other milestones that I feel were significant along the way. When I talking about APIs, I'm focused one version that was born out of the enterprise, during the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) movement, which sometime around 2000, a portion of the SOA experiment left the enterprise and found a more fertile environment in the world of start-ups. In 2016, this version of API has re-captured the attention of the enterprise, as they see them being used in popular, public API driven services, and the startups they are acquiring and gobbling up. Where we stand in 2016, there are some obvious technical reasons of why web APIs are finding success in companies of all shapes and sizes, and even within government; but not all the reasons for this success is technical. There are many other, less obvious aspects of web APis that have contributed to their success, things we can only learn by closely studying the past and looking at why some of the pioneers of web APIs were successful, and have continued to be successful over the years. In 2016, it is critical that we emulate the best practices that have been established over the last 16 years, following the lead of early API providers like Amazon, Salesforce, eBay and Twitter--much of what is still being emulated by new API practitioners in 2016. As a startup, SMB, enterprise, institution, and government agency organization, you don't have to follow every example set in this 16 year history, but you should...[<a href="/2016/03/27/some-milestones-from-the-last-15-years-of-web-api-history/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>25 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>As I was reviewing patent #20160070605:&nbsp;Adaptable Application Programming Interfaces And Specification Of Same, from yet another person I know, after I pick my head up off the desk, I begin thinking about all of the unintended consequences of API patents. Here is the abstract from this work of beauty: Aspects of the disclosure relate to defining and/or specifying an application programming interface (API) between a client and a computing device (such as a server) in a manner that the client, the computing device, or both, can evolve independently while preserving inter-operability. This is something that WE ALL should be building into our clients, and is fundamental to all this API shit even working at scale. This particular patent is owned by Comcast, so I'm assuming it will be wielded in the courtroom, and leveraged in back room net neutrality discussions among cable and telco giants. There really isn't a lot of unintended consequences involved when two or three 1000 lb gorillas battle it out. The little people always suffer in these battles, and there really isn't much I can do--I will leave this to my friends in the federal government to take on. Where I feel like I should be speaking up more, is when it comes to the patents being filed by my startup friends, like the hypermedia patents I talked about a few months ago. For weeks after I published that story, my friends came out of the woodwork to tell me this is what you have to do in this game, and they are well meaning, and would never ever use the patent for anything bad. Everyone I talked to I respect, and do believe they mean what they say, but its the unintended consequences that keep me up at night. What happens after your startup is acquired, and you have cashed out, and long gone? Are you going to follow the company who acquired your startup and track on their litigation,...[<a href="/2016/03/25/the-unintended-consequences-of-api-patents/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>25 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I spend a lot of time gathering, creating, and organizing machine readable OpenAPI Specs, as part of my API Stack, and personal API stack work. I'm not insane enough to think I can create OpenAPI Specs for all of the public APIs out there, I'm just trying to tip the scales regarding how many API definitions that are out there, to increase the usage and value of open tooling, which in turn will increase the number of people who will create their own OpenAPI Specs. (just kind of sort of insane) As I do this work, I realize how easily I can obsess over unnecessary, and meaningless metrics and goals in the tech space. Two things have stood out for me as I do this work: Overall Number of API Specs - Much like our obsession over the completely meaningless and incorrect number of APIs that are in the ProgrammableWeb directory, the number of OpenAPI Specs means nothing. At some arbitrary point, things will change and people will get on board--it is already happening. The Complete OpenAPI Spec - Having a complete OpenAPI Spec that contains ALL endpoints, parameters, and underlying data schema is a myth, and really doesn't matter. You only need as much as you are going to use. Maybe to API providers this matters, but to consumers, you only need what you need. The trick is figuring out what this is, without dumping everything on a consumer. I won't stop what I am doing. As an experienced technologists I know when I am simply a tool in a larger game, and I perform as the automatron that is expected of me. However I will not obsess over the completeness of the API specs, or ever showcase the overall number of OpenAPI Specs that I have--I'll just keep on working. In this data driven world, it is easy to get caught up in focusing on mythical, meaningless, data points.

			<p><em>25 Mar 2016</em></p>

I get these regular updates from FullContact when there is new information available about the contacts I have added to my contact list of people I care about. Anytime there is a new photo, social network, or other element of their contact information updated, I get notified, andI &nbsp;can choose to update it in my CRM.
Would someone go ahead and create this, but for OpenAPI Specifications? All you have to do is use Github, and build your own index of the websites of leading companies who are publishing APIs (common crawl is good start), and begin keeping track of ALL of the OpenAPI Specs, and API Blueprints that are increasingly spread across the web. Then you will need to develop some sort of API definition diff solution (which I've talked about before), and then send me any changes or updates that I do not have in my directory of API definitions--which you know, because you have indexed already.
You can offer premium services, like private repositories, and pathways to the wealth of API definition driven tooling out there. Again, this is something I could very well do, except I am one person, and not really interested in doing anything beyond all the work I already do. Especially if it involves taking VC money, scaling, and being any closer to the machine than I already am. So if you could get to work on this for me, and help solve this growing need in the API space, that would be great! Yeah. Also make sure and cut me in for 10% of all the $$$ you are going to make.

			<p><em>24 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I play with a lot of services that are looking to provide solutions to the API industry, and I'm always looking to better understand what leading API services providers are using to deploy their warez. I was test driving the testing and monitoring solutions from Opsee this week, and separate from the solutions they provide (which I'll talk about later), I thought the deployment of their API testing and monitoring solutions was worthy of talking about all by itself. Opsee deploys as a micro-instance within my AWS stack, and gets to work testing and monitoring the APIs that I direct it to, providing a very precise, and effective way of doing monitoring. I do not think this approach will work in all scenarios, for all API providers, but I think packaging up the services, so that API providers can deploy within their stack, and run within the cloud or on-premise environment they choose, is a potentially very powerful formula. I have written before about offering up your APIs as wholesale or private label solutions before, and I would categorize what Opsee is doing as offering up your API industry service provider as wholesale or private label solutions. Many companies will do just fine consuming your SaaS or publicly available API driven solution, but more sophisticated operations, and potentially regulated companies, are going to need a solution that will run within existing infrastructure, not outside the firewall.&nbsp; I could see bandwidth and CPU intensive situations also benefiting from this approach. Opsee's way of doing things has gotten me thinking more about how we package up and deploy the services we are selling to API providers. Once Opsee was up and running in my stack, using a set of keys I setup and configured especially for it, it got to work monitoring the endpoints I tell it to. I could also see this approach also work as a locally available API, where I tell my systems to...[<a href="/2016/03/24/deploying-the-api-service-providers-that-i-depend-on-within-my-own-infrastructure/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>As I'm working through my morning work monitoring the API space, I'm proccesing stories about the availability of valuable resources, like the&nbsp;House Rules Committee data being released in XML formats, and&nbsp;ExoMol, the molecular line lists DB used in simulation of atmospheric models of exoplanets, brown dwarfs &amp; cool stars.&nbsp; I feel fortunate to live in a time where the world is opening up such valuable resources, making them available online--available for anyone to use, remix, improve, and make better. My faith in APIs doesn't come from any single API, it comes from the possibilities that will exist when individuals, companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies all publish valuable resources using APIs. While there is still a lot of work ahead, I'm seeing the early signs of this reality emerging across my API monitoring in 2016. I'm coming across so many, extremely valuable, openly licensed, machine readable resources that can be used in some very interesting ways. The trick now, is how do we expose the most meaningful parts of these resources, and make sure they get found by the people who will actually put them to use. As the number of APIs increase, this is something that is going to get harder and harder, and the need for value even more critical. Another dimension to this discussion is the growing number of channels we need to make our API resources available in. Web and mobile are still king when it comes to consuming APIs, but quickly devices, messaging, voice, bots, and other channels are growing in use. The next wave of API evangelism is going to require that the right people (domain experts) are available to help expose the most meaningful skills that our APIs posses, via these growing number of quick moving channels. An example of this in action, using one of the valuable resources above, could involve making the Congressional activity that is most relevant and important to me, available in my Slack...[<a href="/2016/03/23/exposing-the-meaningful-skills-our-apis-possess-for-use-in-the-next-gen-messaging-and-voice-apps/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I have self-censored stories about microservices, because I have felt the topic is as charged as linked data, REST, and some parts of the hypermedia discussion. Meaning there are many champions of the approach, who insist on telling me, and other folks how WRONG they are in the approach, as opposed to helping us work through our understanding of exactly what is microservices, and how to do well. For me, when I come across tech layers that feel like this, they are something that is very tech saturated, with the usual cadre of tech bros leading the charge, often on behalf of a specific vendor, or specific set of vendor solutions. Even with this reality, I've read a number of very smart posts, and white papers on microservices in the last year, outlining various approaches to designing, engineering, and orchestrating your business, using the "microservices diet". Much of what I read nails much of the technology in some very logical, and sensible ways--crafted by some people with mad skills when it comes to making sense of very large companies, and software ecosystems. Even with all of this lofty thinking, I'm seeing one common element missing in most of the microservices approaches I have digest--the human element. I hear a lot of discussion about technical approaches to unwinding the bits and bytes of technical debt, but very little guidance for anyone on how to unwind the human aspect of all of this, acknowledging the years of business and political decisions that contributed to the technical debt. Its one thing to start breaking apart your databases, and systems, but its another thing to start decoupling how leadership invests in technology, the purchasing decisions that have been made, and the politics that surrounds these existing legacy systems. I don't know about you, but every legacy system I've ever come across almost always has had a gatekeeper, an individual, or group of individuals who will fight you to the...[<a href="/2016/03/22/your-microservices-effort-will-fail-if-you-only-focus-on-the-technical-details/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I have looked at way more Bots than I should have in the last couple days, and I'm beginning to see&nbsp; similar patterns emerging across bot implementations, in sync with what I shared as part of my advice to API service providers. After you look at hundreds of APIs, and now a couple hundred bot implementations, you really begin to see what some of the common building blocks of the successful bot implementations are: Domain - Having a domain dedicated to the bot, its operations, and the community around it. Website&nbsp;- Simple, modern, and informative website for your folks to discover, and put your bot to work. Logo - Having a simple, modern, and often clever logo and overall branding to your bots presence. Twitter&nbsp;- Have a genuine, active Twitter account that actually engages in conversations with community. Github&nbsp;- Establish an active, and useful Github presence via a dedicated user account or organization. Blog&nbsp;- Provide a thoughtful, active, and informative blog that engages with a community,&nbsp; customers, and the public at large. API&nbsp;- You are using open APIs, and messaging formats to make your bot work, pay it forward with APIs and Webhooks. Monetization&nbsp;- You gotta make some money, how are you going to keep the lights on, feed and cloth your bot. ;-) Support&nbsp;-Every bot will need support, even if it is automated. Make sure have answer questions via Twitter, and Github.&nbsp; The most interesting bots I came across, whether they are Twitter, Slack, or Telegram bot, all had at least half of the items listed above. I'm guessing we are going to see a huge surge in the number of bots that are available, as well as the platforms in which bots can operate, and I am thinking that the bots that follow these patterns will be floating to the top of the churn. I'm just getting started documenting the common building blocks in this recent surge in API driven bot activity.

			<p><em>22 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I'm constantly working to hand-craft, scrape-craft, and auto-generate OpenAPI Specs, and APIs.json files for as many of the top APIs I can. It is something Steve Willmott (@njyx), the CEO of 3Scale always flicks me shit about, saying I shouldn't have to do that--API providers should be doing this! While I agree, I feel like we haven't reached the point where all providers understand the importance of having an up to date OpenAPI Spec available for their API (some even have them, and work to hide them!)
This is something the savvy API providers like SendGrid are doing, rolling around Github, making sure copies of their OpenAPI Specs are up to date.&nbsp;

Thank Elmer, you da man. Now I just need to convince another 2K other API providers of the importance of having up to date machine readable API definitions available, and actively maintain them. Having your definitions up to date, and easy to find increases the chance a developer will load up in the favorite HTTP client like Postman, Postman, PAW, or API Garage.&nbsp;
Its going to happen Steve! I tell you! Some day, all the good API providers will maintain their own API definitions. You should always have an easy to find copy available as part of your API documentation, but you should also search for them on Github, and submit pull requests to keep them up to date. It is like have little machine readable business cards for your API, sitting on the desks of developers, except with this business card allows you to submit a pull request to update.&nbsp;
P.S. While on the subject--PUBLISH AN RSS FEED FOR YOUR BLOG!!! ;-)

			<p><em>22 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I'm seeing a significant shift in the conversations around how SaaS, and API-first platforms are planning access to their APIs. I'm seeing a pretty significant back peddling around free, and freemium access levels. I'm trying to keep notes on what I'm hearing, so that I can better understand what is causing this, and see if I can identify where the balance might exist in providing self-service access to API our valuable resources. Let' me explore some of the main reasons I'm hearing for reducing, restricting, or completely doing away with these lower level areas of access: Too Many API Freeloaders - There is a growing number of poorly behaved API consumers who are just looking for a free ride. At Odds With Sales Teams - Free layers of access cannibalize our sales cycle, and make it harder for sales teams to close the deal. These Layers Do Not Convert - The users coming in at these layers are just not converting, and becoming paid customers. We Built It And Nobody Came - Nobody seems to care about the API, and nobody signed up for acess, so we are shutting down. No More Money To Support Free - We just don't have the money to pay for the infrastructure and support it takes to support. VC's Told Us To Focus On Enterprise - Our investors told us to focus all our attention on selling to the enterprise, consumer focus is gone.&nbsp; When it comes to providing and consuming APIs, I've seen it all. I sympathize with many of these reasons for shrinking of the free tiers of access to APIs. There will be many contributing factors to why things might be off in an API community. As my friend Ed Anuff (@edanuff) focused on in his latest post about how a large number of us are doing API wrong, with many companies approach to APIs being fundamentally at odds with their ecosystem.&nbsp; Ultimately I think that...[<a href="/2016/03/22/i-am-hearing-a-lot-more-talk-about-restricting-free-and-freemium-tiers-of-api-access/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I am slowly getting sucked into the world of bots. I've been tagging stories related to Twitter bots for some time, but it was the growing buzz of Slack bots that has really grabbed my attention. It pushed me to light up a research area, so that I can begin to look at things closer, and work to understand the common building blocks, like I do for the other areas of the API space. The world of bots intrigues me, from the perspective of how APIs can be used to execute bots, but also provide the valuable resources needed to deliver bot functionality. I feel like the list of categories of available Slack bots are somewhat telling of the business potential for bots: Analytics Communication Customer Support Design Developer Tools File Management Health &amp; Medical HR Marketing Office Management Payments &amp; Accounting Productivity Project Management Security &amp; Compliance Social &amp; Fun Travel While I find Twitter bots creative and interesting, there are many I also found annoying as hell. I've had similar responses to some of the bots I've encountered on Slack. I tend to be pretty boring when it comes to goofy shit online, so my threshold for bot silliness is low. I don't care what others do, I just don't go there that often, so you'll see me highlighting more of the business productivity bots, or the more creative ones.&nbsp; Another thing I think is significant, is the growing number of platforms in which bots are becoming common practice, with many of the bots operating on multiple platforms. Twitter bots Slack bots Tumblr bots YouTube bots Reddit bots Telegram bots Snapchat bots Kik bots Trello bots Another interesting part of this, is that not all bots are executed via API. Some bots simply use the chosen protocol of popular messaging applications, and operate via an account setup on the platform. However, even with these implementations, APIs still come into play in providing the...[<a href="/2016/03/21/sucked-into-the-world-of-bots-and-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>For some workshops preparation this week, I needed to isolate just the best of the API calls and documentation from handful of APIs I am trying to teach my intended audience about. I have almost twenty separate companies targeted, with a couple hundred individual endpoints across the API provided served up by these companies. I needed to a way to easily define, organize, and present a subset of API samples, intended for a specific purpose audience.&nbsp; In this workshop, I need the simplest, most intuitive samples possible across these popular APIs. For Twitter I need to be able to just send a tweet, or list friends, and on Facebook I need to post to my wall, and search for user. I need simple actions, that will be meaningful to my higher education audience--most likely students. I don't want to bury all of them with the endless API possibilities that surround the APIs I'm showcasing, I need the twenty use cases that they'll give a shit about, and result in them being interested in what an API is. As I do with all my research, I organize my lists of APIs into APIs.json collections, and publish the results as a Github repository. This allows me to quickly assemble, relevant collections of APIs, designed for specific audiences, in a way that I can wrap with informative content and stories, helping them on-board with the importance of APIs, as well as the individual APIs. This got me thinking, because as part of an APIs.json index I have all the moving parts identified, I just need a way to simplify, and distill down into little API samples, so that I can offer up through the experience I am crafting. To help me in my effort I started defining a new APIs.json API type schema, which allows me to define a sample subset of any API I have defined using OpenAPI Spec. Within each schema, I can map to a...[<a href="/2016/03/17/further-simplifying-my-api-docs-and-providing-api-samples/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am preparing a project for the conversations, and a workshop I have on my schedule this week at Davidson College, called:&nbsp;Indie EdTech &amp; The Personal API.&nbsp;I'll be going on campus, talking to campus leadership, administrators, teachers, and students about APIs. To put myself into the right frame of mind, I wanted to explore what the concept of a personal API. The Concept Of Personal APIs Is RidiculousFirst, I'll set the stage with what is a common reaction, when I mention the term "personal API" to other API folk in the space: "Its a nice idea, but it just isn't something the average person will ever need, let alone care about what an API is--it is a non problem." To me, that response sounds just like what you'd hear in early 2000's when asked if any single individual would ever need a web presence--something that blogging and the social media star has continued to&nbsp; evolve, while also proving the naysayers wrong.&nbsp; At first glance, a personal API seems like it would be a stack of APIs that you would setup, and manage yourself. Again, something the average developer or IT person would dismiss as out of the realm of reason for the average person--there just isn't a need. I would probably agree here. While having a set of APIs that could help you manage your life bits sounds like a great idea, I just don't think the average Internet user is going to care about their digital life bits at this level--the average person will have to have a an actual problem to solve, before they will ever need and care about an API (secret is that this is true for business too) Everybody Already Has Personal APIsI prefer looking at this topic as something that has already been answered--everyone already has personal APIs!

			<p><em>14 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I'm evaluating the Alexa Voice Service ecosystems alongside leading API messaging platforms like Telegram, and Slack, who are changing the way users engage and communicate, but also are evolving how we are putting our API driven resources to work. As I do this research, I keep finding myself coming back to Amazon's concept of an Alexa Skill, and thinking about how it applies to average everyday APIs like mine. Do my APIs have the skills they need to compete in this new voice and bot enabled world? It is bad enough that I don't always have the skills necessary to compete as a programmer, but now my APIs have to have the right skills? WTF ;-) Seriously though, I feel the Amazon's concept of the "skill" reflects a wider experiental shift in the API space, where APIs need to deliver information and other digital resources in the context of how they will be experienced by users, and not just how they are stored and maintained by developers and IT operations. Since there is such a diverse amount of APIs out there, what exactly consitutes as a "skill" could vary widely. If you are person or business directory, the skill might be returning the website address or phone number for an individual or business. If you are an email or SMS service it might be simply send a message to an individual. The concept of a skill further come into focus when you think in context of Alexa Voice Service, or as Amazon puts it: Alexa, the voice service that powers Amazon Echo, provides capabilities, or skills, that enable customers to interact with devices in a more intuitive way using voice. Examples of skills include the ability to play music, answer general questions, set an alarm or timer, and more. How does this same way of thinking apply when we are communicating in Slack? Does my API have the same skills to identify that someone just...[<a href="/2016/03/14/do-my-apis-have-the-skills-they-need-to-compete-in-a-voice-and-bot-enabled-world/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>14 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was experimenting with breaking apart API definitions over the weekend, and exploring different ways of assembling the moving parts into different types of tools, visualizations, and other goodies. I do not have any particular objective with this work, other than just pushing the boundaries of we dynamically tell the story of our APIs, and hopefully assist in moving forward the current available API documentation toolbox we have for API providers, and consumers.
Yesterday I published a short piece on API definition driven tag clouds,&nbsp;and this morning I have an API definition driven autocomplete text box, providing access to the paths, verbs, or tags present in any single, or multiple OpenAPI Specs that are indexed using APIs.json.

This particular edition of the API.json and OpenAPI Spec autocomplete pulls across the SMS API providers included in my SMS API research, but is something that will be available for any of my research areas, as part of my ever evolving set of APIs.json tooling. I will be building these into my own custom API design tooling, allowing me to quickly recall the hundreds of endpoints available in my API stack, as well as learn about additional API endpoints available in the 3rd party APIs I already depend on.
I am going to also play with how I can use across the documentation of the APIs that I include in my research. Ultimately I would like to see these types of solutions available as a suite of UI, and UX tools in my overal API driven, hacker storytelling toolbox, allowing me to better tell stories around what APIs can do.

			<p>I am playing with different ways of exploring APIs, building on documentation solutions like Swagger UI, Lucybot Console, and Slate. I want to push the boundaries of how we document, tell stories, and understand our APIs. I'm playing with two different formats, one is driven using Jekyll + Liquid, and the other are more embeddable JavaScript editions. I haven't hit on anything groundbreaking, but I am having fun breaking up the API definitions of common APIs, and organizing them for different experiences. This weekend I took my API Stack tag cloud, and made it driven by API collections defined using APIs.json and OpenAPI Spec. Instead of driving it from a simple tag JSON file, I wired it up to the APIs.json for each of my research projects, and it loops through each API that is indexed, finds their OpenAPI Spec, and uses various elements to publish as tags. First I applied to my SMS research, to help me understand the verb usage across the APIs: Then I wanted to scale it, and see what the tag cloud would look like when applied to a larger collection: I'm not sure if these visualizations offer me any value, but it gets me thinking about APIs at the macro level, considering different ways to slice and dice the information available as part of any of the API's indexed. The verb tag cloud is extracted from an API I have that returns the verb count for any APIs.json collection, which gives me one possible data point to consider when quantifying how open, or closed an API is. Its not always constant, due to the wide variety of ways people design their APIs, but when you see an API that is all GET, there is good chance they are pretty tight with their resources. As a quick next step, I also connected it up to the tags applied across all the OpenAPI Specs indexed, looking a different slice of the...[<a href="/2016/03/13/api-definition-driven-visualizations-verb-tag-clouds/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>11 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was reading a post on Amazon's new SMART(Surveillance Marketed As Revolution Techonology) water pitcher, which is more about Amazon's new connected device partner commerce strategy, than it is about this individual connected device example. The quote from the story explains the strategy pretty well. Last week, Amazon.com curiously devoted an entire press release to a water pitcher. But not just any water pitcher. Rather, Amazon detailed a new partnership with Brita to bring consumers the $45 smart Brita Infinity Pitcher. Just connect it to your Wi-Fi, and the Brita Infinity Pitcher will automatically track how much water passes through its filter. Then, using Amazon Dash Replenishment, it'll automatically order a new filter when a replacement is needed. So now, your pitchers orders its replacement filters, your lights will order new bulbs, your printer will order more of those wonderfully expensive print cartridges for you. At a consumer level, most of this seems pretty lazy to me, and unnecessary, but then again, I do not represent mainstream society in any way. Having your common devices in your life, order up their replacement parts, or even servicing, seems pretty attractive, but is something I'm sure we won't consider the downside until its way to late. Ok, let's stop for a second. There is your new startup idea Jane / Joe entrepreneur, "the Angie's List + Dash Replenishment == service scheduling API platform". My cable modem calls for a service provider when the modem needs replaced with newer model, my refrigerator and dishwasher call repair(wo)man when they are not running at optimal levels. When you get your funding, make sure and cut me in for a point or two. ;-) Well, as with 96% of this API circus, I'm not highlighting this because I think it is a good idea, I am talking about because it is happening, and will begin impacting the rest of us.

			<p><em>10 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I am borrowing from the very prescient post from Martin Fowler, an older post, but is a topic that should be revisited regularly. Google translate tells me Datensparsamkeit means "data minimization". I prefer Fowler's translation:
It's an attitude to how we capture and store data, saying that we should only handle data that we really need.
My partner in crime Audrey Watters (@audreywatters) sent me the link, and expressing that it was very telling that we (United States) do not have a word that applies for this concept. I think data minimization gets the point across, but I think Fowler elevates it from being just a data process, to something that should be rooted in company culture.
I am adding&nbsp;Datensparsamkeit as a building block to any area of the API life cycle that will potentially store data. The goal is to help API platforms consider &nbsp;how they capture and store data at the strategy level, as well as tactically at every stop along the API life cycle, and only capture and store exactly what you need, and nothing more.
Just because cloud storage is cheap doesn't mean we should capture and store everything we can--just because we can, doesn't mean we sould. Data can just as easily be a liability as it can be an asset, and your machinations around there being an all knowing, all seeing big data future are pure fantasy. The real trouble becomes clear when you realize that the majority of the tech sector, and the NSA, kind of enjoy living in this fantasy world.

			<p><em>10 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>One topic that has been present in numerous discussions lately is just how much work goes into designing, deploying, and managing APIs, as well as around the integration between the growing number of APIs. It keeps coming up in conversations with existing API service providers, as well as internal actors within small business, enterprise, and government API efforts. When you live and breathe API, it all just makes sense in your head, but as API architects, designers, and believers trying to shepherd forward your API within existing organizations, it will come up against many unanticipated challenges.&nbsp;I have discussed this before with my stories about 75% of your API efforts in the enterprise being cultural and political, not technical, and with a short one on your API strategy providing a glimpse into your company culture. In any API journey, there will always be numerous business, political, and ultimately human obstacles between you and the API success you see in your head, something that takes investment, and access to the right expertise and resources. In conversations with API tooling and service providers lately, the need to focus more resources in training, development, and integration services has come up several times. It is good that companies in the space are recognizing the need, and investing in what is needed. Where the imbalance in all of this begins to show up, is that it isn't something these companies are willing to highlight as a core competency on their site, or in my storytelling, because it is viewed as a potential negative with investors. I am guessing that investment in training, development and integration services just isn't trendy enough for VCs. I get it. Investors want to put their money into the coolest tools, the ones that match all the stories they are hearing. However I can't help but feel this positioning is creating an imbalance that is preventing some very interesting tools, and API driven solutions from getting the...[<a href="/2016/03/10/an-imbalance-in-investment-priorities-that-will-continue-to-slow-api-growth-and-adoption/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>10 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>When a startup goes away, either through acquisition, or any other reason, and I find the site dormant, with a friendly goodbye message, or just gone, I usually just remove the tag from them in my primary system, and they are gone from my research with the next publishing of the project.&nbsp; When Parse announced they are turning off the lights, and Kimono Labs said they were going away after an "acquisition" by Palantir, I started putting more thought into what I was going to do at the time of deprecation. I want to be able to capture more of these stories. I actually have a lot of data, content, notes, and analysis on these companies that are going away, and I need to do a better job making it all accessible. To support this effort I am beginning to add a dead pool page to each of my research areas, where I will simply re-tag any company or organization that is present in my research, when the shut off the lights--providing a single place where we can see our recent history. I find it valuable to have this recent history, right at my fingertips, when I am trying to understand where each of my research areas are headed. Without the actual companies to reference I am reliant on my own memory, which isn't always the best. In the tech space, I feel like we are good at focusing on the future, and we easily forget the past, even what just happened last month. I am always amazed at which startups just go away, without any notice. Many of them do not have customers, but some of them do, and many of them have aksed me for my thoughts on the space, and on their road maps. Part of having a deprecation page is also to inform newcomers that the road is littered with corpses of those who came before them, but to also provide...[<a href="/2016/03/10/adding-a-dead-pool-page-to-each-api-research-area-so-we-remember-the-past/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>It definitely sucks that Parse went away like they did, but you have to commend them on the page they left behind. Facebook put up the download link to an open source version of Parse Server, and a link to the migration guide. I like that they also left up the blog, which I think is almost just as important as the code, telling the story of what happened, right up to the end.

I come across newly deprecated API providers, and API service providers all the time. Most of the time they are just dormant, nothing going on but the site is up, and other times the website is just gone, with no message at all. I rarely ever come across anyone who puts up an open source version of their platform, with instructions on what to do next, and leave the blog up.
If you are running an API, or a service that caters to the API space, and you are facing shutting everything down, feel free to reach out, and I'm happy to put up a splash page, help organize a Github repo of any server, and client code, as well as your API definitions. I'm happy to pay for the domain, so that the work you did doesn't go away, and people can learn from, and in some cases build off of what you did.&nbsp;

			<p>I am building on my conversation with&nbsp;Abhinav Asthana (@a85), the&nbsp;Co-founder and CEO&nbsp;of&nbsp;Postman, around how we can simplify the API documentation we are providing to our API consumers. As part of my work to profile the 50+ stacks of APIs I list on my home page, I am playing with different ways of listing APIs, sharing the valuable endpoints available within, and other key aspects with users. All this work is being driven by APIs.json, and Open API Spec listings. First I've rewritten my main API listing page using Liquid, running in Jekyll, which uses a _data folder full of APIs.json, and OpenAPI Specs published as part of each of my API life cycle, or API stack research. To operate, this listing just mounts the _data folder, and loops through all APIs.json files it contains, then parses each property present, giving special attention to OpenAPI Spec, and API plan formats. Liquid + Jekyll, running on Github Pages gives me a simple, static way of representing the machine readable indexes I generate for any of my research areas using APIs.json, OpenAPI Spec, and my new API plan format. Jekyll gives me the entire contents of the API definitions I'm storing in my _data folder, as a single Liquid object which I can loop through, to generate the static HTML for my listing of APIs. Using this approach gives me a machine readable index of all the moving parts of any single, or multiple API collection.&nbsp; The list of SMS APIs in this research is pretty verbose. I'm not even listing out the parameters, headers, and other details of each API, and the listings are pretty involved--further backing up&nbsp;Abhinav thoughts around simplifying the API documentation that we are generating. To help me push forward my Liquid skills, and the possibilities around breaking up the properties of each API defined using APIs.json, I took the same code and generated a separate, trimmed down version which only shows the APIs...[<a href="/2016/03/08/playing-with-concepts-around-simplifying-the-api-docs-that-are-generated-using-api-definitions/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>If you follow my blog at all you know I love Noun Project icons. I started using them with my last minimal website design, and is something I've carried over with the latest edition. I've been using some images for so long I even started reworking, remixing, and making my own images, to help me tell my API stories.&nbsp; I find it difficult to conjure up just the right image, or images, to represent many very abstract API concepts, so it is something I am constantly working on alongside my research, as well as writing. As I was working on the content for a workshop I am doing at Davidson College this month, I wanted to have a simple, icon-based way for expressing just how open an API is (or isn't). &nbsp;My first crack at coming up with an icon set, breaks things down into three distinct groups. API (Flowing) API (Just Is) API (Not Flowing) My objective here is to provide a quick and easy way to help articulate how open an API is or isn't. Right now, these icons are set manually by me, based upon my overall feeling of the platform, the access they offer (or don't), terms of service, and overall business model. This will evolve in the future, as I have a lot of data that could also influence these ratings, but for now, it is all me. (Mwahahahaaaa) In this particular use case, I want to help university students better understand the many types of APIs, but in the future I'd like to evolve the ranking, and the icon set to be more meaningful, and apply across all of my research, anywhere you come across an API. I also just like playing with icons, and using my mad graphic design skills (not).&nbsp; Full Disclosure: The faucet idea was Audrey's idea, but she doesn't like the faucets I ended up using--maybe I'll switch them out with another set in future....[<a href="/2016/03/08/new-icons-for-helping-me-communicate-how-open-or-closed-an-api-is/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>08 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was being interviewed by an IBM group the other day, and I scribbled some thoughts on a piece of paper as I was rambling, which I just picked up trying to make sense of what was going through my mind, before I archive the chicken scratches.&nbsp; It look like during the call I was talking about how I see the world of API deployment, based upon how I am currently organizing providers, services, and tooling that I find. I was discussing with them how I am moving towards breaking things down into four buckets: Gateway - The more enterprise focused, IT department led API efforts, usually conducted at larger enterprises, and institutions. Artisan - A more farm to table, hand crafted approach that employs organic open source REST frameworks in the process. Cloud - Leverage the latest breed of cloud API service providers that allow you to deploy APIs from common resources online. Serverless - Outdoing the artisan hipster approach, all the cool kids are doing it without servers, piece by piece using Iron.io and Lambda. My API deployment research has just been a single list of service providers, and open source tooling for the last couple of years. Its time I started breaking things down a little more, and helping my readers find solutions based upon a more realistic approach to how APis are being deployed in the wild, or at least within their organizations. I almost added database as layer here, but I want to keep these API deployment buckets more about the middle layer in between the backend infrastructure, and the clients that wll be consuming API resources. API deployment touches on API design and definitions, and stops short of API management, with some overlap with containers, and API virtualization. This post also reveals the fact that I write most of these stories to help me think through the world of APis, get my thoughts in order, and help formalize them...[<a href="/2016/03/08/four-buckets-to-organize-my-api-deployment-research-into/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>As I made my way through nine of the leading SMS providers, profiling the details of their API plans, trying to bring it all together into a single, machine readable definition, Messente's pricing API stood out for me. Alongside their SMS API, and their number lookup API, they have a pricing API. As I take a moment to look at the simplicity of the endpoint, I am also thinking about the potential, and the details of their API docs really stand out for me. In addition to a pricing API being a valuable utility for any API consumer, I can't help but think the process of constructing a pricing API would force API providers to think another layer deeper in their API plan(s). Similar to how you have to think through the details of any resource you make available via an API, considering how it will be put to use, crafting a pricing API would force you to do the same for one of the most valuable, and overlooked resources you offer, that is core to all of your API operations. I've talked about the importance of API providers having management level APIs before, and I think they should also follow the lead of API providers like Messente who exist in a pretty mature sector, and have a handle on their API pricing. I've said it before, and will keeping harping on this issue...that all API providers and their service providers should have pricing APIs, as well as APIs for the other essential building blocks of their API operations. Another thing to note here, that I will be writing about more in the future, is the presence of two-letter country code as a parameter for an API. While not all APIs will have country specific pricing like SMS providers do, the API providers who are looking to truly operate globally, you will need to continue the automation of your operations, making pricing available on demand,...[<a href="/2016/03/07/thinking-through-the-design-of-your-pricing-api-would-help-you-think-through-your-api-plan/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I try to spend time each week evaluating what types of companies are looking for API / developer evangelist / advocates, to help keep my awareness in sync with what mainstream companies are needing (or not), when it comes to API outreach. In a little under an hour last night, I found almost 70 companies who had job postings for an evangelist or advocate for their platform. Google, Brightcove, Pubnub, Atlassian, Yahoo, Uber, Esri, Indix, Couchbase, edX, Amazon, Verifone, IBM Strongloop, Facebook, Microsoft, Intel, Impinj, Twilio, Cybersource, Shopify, Jibo Inc., Vidyo, UrtheCast, Talend, Stormpath, Square, Mailjet, Cylance In., Bandwidth, MediaMath, Nuxeo, Clarifai, NodePrime, Visa, UrtheCast, Stream.io, mLab, FullContact, Sumo Logic , Twitch, Auth0, Iron.io, Wercker, ANS Affiliates Solutions, Okta, Button, Lever, PlayFab, DreamFactory, Nitrous, Firebase, IBM, Accurate Background, Inc., PagerDuty, Coda Search, Aerospike, SGF Global , Bodymedia, DataBricks, Dropbox, Heroku, Gitlab, New RElic, Crate.io, Asana, Vaadin, Ionic, Neura, and Algolia. I gathered these company names, after looking around LinkedIn, Indeed, and a couple of Google searches, over the course of an hour. I'm sure I would find even more if I kept on looking. As the API Evangelist, I have had a handful of these companies reach out, asking if I'm interested in the job, or possibly know someone that would be. Another seasoned evangelist, Keith Casey (@CaseySoftware), Twilio Alum, and Director of Product at @ClarifyIO, who also lives with a similar amount of attention from recruiters, responded like this when I shared the list with him. I&rsquo;ve been contacted by at least 6 on that list in the last week or so.. I end up shutting down most conversations with three questions:&nbsp; #1 What group do you evangelists report to?#2 What metrics are your evangelists measured on?#3 What current marketing channels are working for you? Sometimes but if they can&rsquo;t answer question #2, then it&rsquo;s all made up anyway, and question #3 may answer that too. if they&rsquo;re seeing traction from events, blog posts,...[<a href="/2016/03/07/the-70-platforms-with-job-postings-for-a-developer-evangelist-or-advocate-currently/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>
As I finish writing a piece on the 70 platforms who are looking for an API evangelist or developer advocate currently, sharing the wisdom of leading evangelist I follow in the space, I am also working to gather up my own wisdom so that I can share. While i am not an evangelist for a single API, I was at one point in my career, and I also practice many of the same techniques in my own work, evangelizing for all APis.
Out of my lists of advice for existing, and new API evangelists, one stands out: take care of yourself.&nbsp;Make sure and find balance in what you do, or you will burn out. You can ask anyone who has been in the scene for a while, and they'll tell you the same thing. However my message is ringing my ears right now, because I hit a wall last year with evangelism, and part of it was due to a fairly scary health concern.
In 2015, I finally settled down long enough to get health insurance (thanks Obama, jeez ;-), and made it to the doctor, who told me my liver wasn't functioning as expected, was fatty, overloaded, and sending out some pretty bad signals to the rest of my body. When you look through my timeline on Twitter or Facebook, it is pretty easy to understand why this is---no surprise here.
Anyways, luckily the liver is (hopefully) a pretty resilient part of the body, something that will recover now that I'm NOT drinking, not traveling, and getting more exercise. Anyways, I just wanted to take the opportunity to caution other evangelist out there to be careful, and make sure that finding balance is a priority, or you may find yourself in a situation where you might not be able to recover. I hate being the old dude of the bunch, but please take care of yourself, the work we do is important.&nbsp;

			<p><em>07 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I had an exchange with Abhinav Asthana (@a85), the&nbsp;Co-founder and CEO&nbsp;of Postman on Twitter today. He was tweeting about API documentation, and I chimed in with my support, about how we need to keep evolving our approach to delivering API documentation so that they speak to a diverse audience. An API description created by experts is probably not the right way for building docs meant for beginners. &mdash; Abhinav Asthana (@a85) March 7, 2016 While I think we have come along ways with the introduction of Swagger UI, making learning about APIs much more interactive, and hands on, I think its time to look at how we can further refine how we deploy API documentation for our users. There is a lot going on with an API sometimes, and listing out all your endpoints, parameters, example requests, responses, and other elements can be overwhelming for new users who are just looking to learn the basics of an API, or possibly just get at s single resource, completing a specific action.&nbsp; Swagger UI, and similar API definition driven documentation like Lucybot API Console, do well in providing a comprehensive set of documentation for a potentially wide variety of API docs, but we need to keep scratching. I'm not exactly sure what the answer here is, but I'd love to see much more simpler, embeddable, API documentation emerge. Solutions that allow API providers to display a small set of precise APIs, or possibly come up with some sort of slick user interface (UI), that delivers a simpler, more meaningful user experience (UX) that speaks to what a specific group of users is needing. This is not a well-formed idea of mine, but is something I want to get out early. I'm seeing an increase in the number of new API documentation resources lately, and hopefully I can influence at least one or two of their road maps with my ideas. This is one reason I've broke out...[<a href="/2016/03/07/it-would-be-nice-to-have-some-simpler-interactive-api-documentation-in-addition-to-what-we-have-now/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I was pushing forward my API plan research this weekend, building on some of the tooling I developed during the last round, and the machine readable API plan format I hammered out late last year to help me define API plans. This time I'm applying it to nine of the SMS API providers I'm currently profiling, trying to get a new view of the plans of SMS APIs like Twilio and Plivo, but also working &nbsp;to continue polishing my 100K view on the SMS API industry.&nbsp; Documenting The API Plans Of Nine SMS APIsThis last friday I got to work profiling the pricing, plans, rate limits, and access tiers for nine of the leading SMS API providers that I keep an eye on. From their pricing pages I gathered the common metrics, limitations, geographic considerations, pricing, and other element offered by each provider, putting them into separate buckets, standardizing how I record these valuable aspects of each API providers resource. This is a process I'd say 1/3 of the time falls right into place, 1/3 of the time it takes some translation and massaging to make it fit, and the other 1/3 things just don't fit into any common way of thinking. Identifying The Common Metrics&nbsp;I found it pretty easy to identify the common metrics applied to SMS APIs, as most everything revolving around the concept of the message and a number. There are nuances to these resources that are being metered, like the separation between SMS and MMS, and a local phone number, toll free phone number, and a short codes, but for now I'm just trying to put pricing into common buckets, by loosely grouping the metrics that are applied via API plans. List of Pricing Across SMS APIsAlong with identifying the common metrics being applied to SMS APIs, I was able to establish a list of the pricing that is being leveraged across these providers.

			<p><em>04 Mar 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was looking to create an APIs.json plus OpenAPI Spec(s) for the WordPress.org API, and the Instructure Canvas Learning Management System (LMS) API. I am pulling together a toolkit to support a workshop at Davidson College in North Carolina this month, and I&nbsp;wanted a handful of APIs that would be relevant to students, and faculty on campus.&nbsp; In my experience, when it comes to documenting large APIs using OpenAPI Spec, you don't want to be hand rolling things, making auto generation essential. There are two options for accomplishing this, 1) I can use a proxy like Charles or Stoplight.io, or 2) I can write a script to scrape the publicly available HTML documentation for each API. While I do enjoy playing with mapping out APIs in Stoplight.io, allowing it do the heavy lifting of crafting each API definition, sometimes there is more relevant meta data for the API available in the API documentation. The OpenAPI Spec, plus APIs.json files for both the WordPress and Instructure Canvas APIs took me about an hour a each, to write the script, and round off the OpenAPI Spec, making sure it was as complete as possible. Through scraping, I get description for endpoints, parameters, and sometimes I also get other detail including sample responses, enum, and response codes. One downside of obtaining an API definition by scraping, is that I only get the surface area of an API, not the responses, and underlying data model. Sometimes this is included in documentation, but I do not always harvest this--waiting until I can get a often more correct schema, when I map out using a proxy or via HAR file. This is OK. I find the trade-off worth it. I'd rather have the more human-centered descriptions, and names of each endpoints, than the response definitions--that will come with time, and more usage of the actual APIs. In the end, it really depends to the size of an API, and the quality...[<a href="/2016/03/04/scraping-static-docs-is-often-better-than-proxy-for-generating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>As I'm thinking about the bigger picture of how startup acquisitions are impacting the world of APIs, I am also having several conversations with folks about their brand spank'n new API focused startup, I can't help but feel that things are never as they seem, when it comes to the 1000 lb gorillas acquisitions within each wave of API driven startups. Of course there are many reasons why big companies gobble up the little startups, one that has a wide range of positive, and negative impacts on the overall health of the API economy, but from my vantage point rarely do the public stories ever size up with the real motivations behind the acquisitions.&nbsp; Why do big companies buy well performing API startups? Leading technology? User adoption? Integrations? Talent acquisition? Revenue? Relevance? Look cool? I'm sure it "could" be a mix of any of those elements, but after seeing many acquisition's get shut down, users flee, and talent jump ship from these soon to be irrelevant, investment saturated startups--I'm always looking for the other motivations beyond why these corporate giants are trying to look alll pretty in their startup jewelry. To me, the motivations behind startup acquisitions are more about what isn't said, than it is ever what is said (jewelry is a distraction). Its about posturing in the space where you dominate (or want to). It is about steering the conversation where you want it to go, and if you don't want things to change, the conversation will go nowhere. It is about sending the right signals to your competition, and the market--all while prancing around wearing your pretty startup jewelry. Ok, so why do I give a shit? Well, when the majority of companies I profile, track on, have conversations, take money from, and in some cases, advocate their products, services, and tooling, are playing in this game, and I have to consider the bigger picture of how shit flows upstream.

			<p>As I look through API portals, profiling the building blocks of successful API platform, I'm always looking for bite-size stories for my readers. I was working to complete my Instagram API definition, as part of my photo API research, and their getting started graphic caught my attention.
This three step getting started visual for Instagram is prominently available on the home page, providing a very distilled down version of what I recommend API providers usually accomplish with a dedicated getting started page.

The featured getting started area provides you with the link to register your application, and overview on authentication and authorization, and a link to all the endpoints, so you can start making requests. I am a big fan of there always being a dedicated getting started page for APIs that I am on-boarding with, but I am always a bigger fan when someone distills these building blocks into something that is way easier to understand, and execute--without all the blah blah blah.
I'm going to consider adding a feature getting started building block, in addition to having the dedicated page. When done right, I think they can accomplsh the same thing, but with one less click--reducing any friction we possibly can in the on-boarding process.

			<p>I have had several conversations with API providers lately who are somewhat frustrated with the way their API operations are going. While their APIs have brought in many new conversations, and supported some interesting integration, they haven't been the business driver that they had hoped when they kicked off their API efforts.&nbsp; There are many reasons why API efforts may not live up to the hype, mostly its because I think we raise the bar too high in Silicon Valley. We raise up the Amazon's and Twilio's up in our mind as models we want follow, and talk about API success in terms of number of users, and in billions of API calls--as just a couple of examples. I will be the first to admit that many of us pundits have over hyped, and is something I've been working to filter out of my storytelling over the last couple of years. The people I am having conversations with admit that an API is necessary, and wouldn't dream of getting rid of their API effort, but are just wrestling with the fact that the API just didn't end up be the business driver like they expected. In most of these conversations, APIs are just having to play second fiddle to traditional business elements like sales, marketing, education, support, and many of the other more mundane, fundamental aspects of business operations. While I can talk through these companies API strategy, to see where I can make suggestions, but in the end, an API is just one of the tools in your business toolbox. Your next customer most likely will not be making their way through your sales funnel simply because you have an API. It may be one important consideration, and almost certainly will come up down the road, but most likely will not be the conversation starter everyone hopes it will be.&nbsp; I do not want to throw a wet blanket on your API enthusiasm.

			<p>
The NextWeb had a great story today that&nbsp;Google has redesigned its developer policies with clearer language and visual examples, and normally I don't jsut parrot what the tech blogosphere publishes, but it's an important enough API message, I think it warrants repeating. In my experience, API providers just emulate what they hear in the space, and stories like this need amplifcation.
What Google did isn't rocket surgery, they just simplified the legalize around what they expect of developers. What better way to actually help ensure these best practices around the platform actual happen, then by actually providing simple titles, summary description, images, and other relevant links, on a developer policy page. In most scenarios developers aren't malicious, they are just usually ignorant of the best practices that often exist in the platforms legalize we agree to, but seldom ever read.
My friend Tyler Singletary (@harmophone)&nbsp;stated that, "the organization here for policy is fun, mostly clear, and interactive. A company the size of Google distilling the deep TOS policy into such a user and developer friendly front end is pretty astounding.&rdquo;&nbsp;-- I agree. Simple like this, when you operate at Google scale can be pretty hard, and is somthing I'd love see standardized across Google offerings.&nbsp;
I will be adding any of the elements from the simplified Google Play developer policy that are missing in my API terms of service, privacy, licensing, and branding research. I will also add the concept of having visuals for each area, or building block, and add the common them of "keep it simple", helping API providers remember that they actually want developers reading and understanding this stuff, not having it buried in the legaleze that nobody will give shit about.

			<p><em>29 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I've been moving forward with my efforts to better on-board folks with the sometimes overwhelming amounts of research available via API Evangelist. I have several groups looking for guidance on where to start with their strategy, as well as develop some lower level tactical approaches to propelling themselves forward in their API journey. I recently posted a master list of my essential building blocks across, 20+ areas of my research, and now I'm distilling these into a single project to help me move forward as one potential operational API strategy for a small businesses. First i took the almost 1000 building blocks I've organized across my areas of API research, and added a question for each, which simply asks where things are with each of these potential considerations along the API life cycle. For this particular small business API strategy, I've opted to include discovery, definitions, design, hypermedia, DNS, deployment, virtualization, containers, management, documentation, SDK, embeddable, real time, webhooks, support, monitoring, testing, road map, authentication, security, terms of service, privacy, licensing, branding, monetization, plans, partners, and evangelism, covering 28 areas of the API life cycle that would be relevant to a small business. The result is a pretty comprehensive API strategy that might help a small business adopt a more coherent framework for their own efforts--the problem is this can still be very high level thinking, and difficult to know where to get going on day one, what to do when you launch a new API, and other more tactical aspects of API operations. &nbsp;To help me bring such a large, lofty API strategy down into the tactical weeds, I'm going to be applying it to my own, existing operations, and deriving a handful of tactical implementations: Day One - Where do we begin, even with a legacy mess of systems, services, web services, and APIs? New Portal - We need to launch our first portal, or possibly a new product, service, or group portal...[<a href="/2016/02/29/a-small-business-api-strategy/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I need some help with APIs! Ok, where can I help you? Well, I have multiple systems, that we use to operate our business on a daily basis, and when we do things in one system, we need the other system to know about it, and when certain events occur we need to trigger pushes or pulls between all systems--this is how many conversations begin as the API Evangelist. While many people think they are looking for an API solution, they are really looking for an API journey, with a little assistance from me along the way. Sure they want an API to make their world more integrated, inter-operable, automated, and real time, but in reality, they are needing to get to work unwinding a mess of legacy technical, business, and political business decisions that have been over years--this takes a journey. Ok, so where do we get started (another common theme lately) in helping quantify the problem set, and what a journey will look like to get us closer to a solution? This post is designed to help you self assess, answer a handful of key questions, and put yourself on a path forward. Internal Systems InventoryWhat systems are involved? If this is a company-wide effort, this might be a more involved task, but if it is a single project, or objective, it will hopefully be much smaller. Regardless of scope, having a well defined inventory of the internal systems that you depend on, is pretty important stuff. Let's get to list making a list of what systems are involved in the API driven solution we are looking for. -------Copy / Repeat Below for Each System------------- What is the system name?&nbsp; What is the public URL of the website for the system?

			<p><em>26 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I often push back against API consumers when they complain about the deprecation of API platform, focusing on the fact that we cannot depend on APIs to be around forever. I also push back against API providers when they express concern around having to support developers forever, for fear of revolt in the community. I think the rational folks in the space understand that a balance is needed in these situations, but alas, there are always new incidents that make us go WTF?? I was reading about Venmo halting new developer access to its API from Techcrunch today, which left me shaking my head, saying damn, damn, damn. I know a lot of you are invested in the startup game, and in all honesty, I am too. A lot of my income comes from startsup, who have taken VC money. I want to believe there can be an ethical path forward in all of this, and it is not all just gambling by a bunch rich white dudes who don't give a shit, but it is getting harder and harder to do. Venmo gained a lot of traction with the support of its API and its developer community, and to just turn off the spigot after riding on the backs of its API and community is just exploitation. I'm not saying they can't shut down their program--I am saying the are obligated to communicate better.&nbsp; In several conversations with folks today, the topic of a ranking system for API providers came up again, with some sort of rating for good and providers, as well as some sort of warning system to alert developers ahead of time, that an API is stumbling. This is something I've been working on for a while, and will keeping working on, with my partners. While I think such a system could help us identify some bad actors early, and incentivize others to think through their approach to API operations, and...[<a href="/2016/02/26/extracting-as-much-value-from-your-api-developers-as-you-can-then-screwing-them-over-in-the-end/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>25 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>As part of a renewed focus on the API discovery definition format APIs.json, I wanted to revisit the propsed machine readable API discovery specification, and see what is going on. First, what is APIs.json? It is a machine readable JSON specification, that anyone can use to define their API operations. APIs.json does not describe your APIs like OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint do, it describes your surrounding API operations, with entries that can reference your Open API Spec, API Blueprint, or any other format that you desire. APIs.json Is An Index For API OperationsAPIs.json provides a machine readable approach that API providers can put work in describing their API operations, similar to how web site providers describe their websites using sitemap.xml. Here are the APIs, who are describing their APIs using APIs.json: APIStrat Austin API API Evangelist Acuity Scheduling BreezoMeter CheckMarket Clarify Data Validation DNS Check Email Hunter FeedbackHub Fitbit Gavagai Kin Lane Link Creation Studio OneMusicAPI Pandorabots API Qalendra RiteTag Singlewire SiteCapt Social Searcher API Super Monitoring Timekit Trade.gov Twitch Bot Directory EnClout frAPI Section.io Spoonacular APIs.json Indexes Can Be Created By 3rd PartiesOne important thing to add, is that these APIs.json files can also be crafted, and published by external parties. An example of this is with the Trade.gov APIs. I originally created that APIs.json file, and coordinated with them to eventually it get published under their own domain, making it an authoritative APIs.json file. Many APIs.json files will be born outside of the API operations they describe, something you can see in my API stack project: The API Stack - Provides almost 1000 APIs.json files, that describe the API operations of many leading public API platforms. There is also around 300 OpenAPI specifications, for some of the platforms described APIs.json Can Be Used To Describe API CollectionsBeyond describing a single API, within a single domain, APIs.json can also be used to describe entire collections of APIs, providing a machine readable way to...[<a href="/2016/02/25/what-is-apis-json-and-what-is-next-for-the-api-discovery-format/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>24 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>In the last six months I was fortunate enough to be able to push forward one of my side projects, with the help of a prototype grant from the Knight Foundation. The mission of the project, is to help move forward existing open federal government data projects, by adopting them, and helping clean up the data, publish simple APIs, generate more meta data, while also telling stories around the project. Something I originally called&nbsp;Federal Agency Dataset Adoption, but then shortened to simply Adopta.Agency. When I was doing my final presentation in Pittsburgh last month, for the Knight Foundation, someone from the University of Miami was present, and when they got home, contacted me about helping move forward the database available at ClinicalTrials.gov. I do not know much about the data present in the collection, but immediately recognized it as a viable Adopta.Agency project. To summarize their request, it went something like this :-) I am working on a project that uses data from https://clinicaltrials.gov/ . Their API is crap to say the least. I was wondering if you could help me out. Is there a tool I could use to get better access to the data? If we download the entire thing is an 850MB zipped file in XML. I only need a fraction of the trials in the db. I guess I am looking for advice on how to proceed.&nbsp; I get questions like this a lot, something that contributed to me pushing forward my Adopta.Agency work. The Knight Foundation prototype grant was just that, the prototype funding, something I intend to keep pushing forward, targeting new data sets, and looking for more open data activists to assist in doing the heavy lifting. The ClinicalTrials.gov database seemed like an excellent candidate because it is a high value data sets, and is something that is pretty poorly presented via the download and API (?) page available at&nbsp;ClinicalTrials.gov.

			<p><em>23 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I had the pleasure of hanging out with Wade Foster (@wadefoster), co-founder and CEO of Zapier (How do you pronounce Zapier? It rhymes with happier :-) recently. As I travel less, I'm looking at doing more of these Google Hangouts, to fill my need for hanging out with super smart people, doing really cool things with APIs.
I am a big fan of what Wade, and the Zapier team are up to. His perspective on helping us define "the process", is extremely empowering for EVERYONE and ANYONE, especially non-developers.



What Zapier enables, is very much aligned with how I would like the API economy end up operating. Where system to system, website, mobile, and device based API integration is important, but platform interoperability for the masses I feel is much more critical. Zapier is how the average person will take control over their digital self, and move the growing amount of data and content we are generating, across across the growing number of service we depend on daily.
Thanks to Wade, and the Zapier team for hanging out with the API Evangelist, and doing such important, and cool work with APIs.

			<p><em>23 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>As I listen to my hangout with Wade Foster of Zapier, I'm considering the overlap between my API reciprocity, bots, virtualization, containerization, webhooks, and even voice research. At the same time I'm thinking about how APIs are being used to inject valuable data, content, and other valuable API driven resources to the stream of existing applications we use every day.&nbsp; Some of this thinking is derived from my bot research, where they impersonate Twitter users, or respond to specific key words, phrases, or keyboard shortcuts in Slack. Some of this thinking comes from learning more about the ability to inject "code steps" into multi-step workflows with Zapier. Then as I continue doing my curation of news I read about Uber allowing developers to create trip experiences, opening up another window for potential API driven injection into the Uber "experience".&nbsp; It got me thinking, where else is this happening? I would say Twitter Cards is a form of this, but is an example that is more media focused, rather than bots (although it could be bot driven behavior). Then I started looking across the 50 areas of the API life cycle I'm monitoring, and voice stood out, as another area of potential overlap. Amazon is allowing developers to inject API driven content, data, and other resources into the conversational stream occurring Alexa users. I don't see this being much different that bots injecting responses into the messaging stream of Slack and Twitter users. I'm just getting going with these thoughts. Something I'm thinking containers, and serverless approaches to API deployment are going to impact this line of thought as well. I'm considering pulling together a research project around this overlap, something I will call API injection. Essentially, how are people injecting API driven data, content, and other resources, into the streams of other applications, using APIs. I could see a whole new breed of API provider emerge, just to satisfy the appetite of bots, and other...[<a href="/2016/02/23/exploring-my-thoughts-around-api-injection-into-messaging-voice-and-other-online-experiences/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>When I talk about companies using APIs to be more transparent, one of the immediate comments I receive from folks is that "not everyone can be public by default". I agree with this situation, but I always counter with an introduction to the concept that transparency can be applied in strictly internal or partner situations as well--public is not the only type of transparency out there. I am a big proponent of the public version of API driven transparency, but I also feel it can be applied within the firewall, as well as on the open web. Simple developer portals, with a quality selection of valuable APIs, up to date interactive documentation, and other resources, available at a known, yet secured location, can go a long way to stimulate integration--both human (team) and system. Self-service access to API design, definitions, deployment, management, testing, and other life cycle strategies, as well as the API resources can go a long way to establish a rich environment for collaboration, reuse, and consistency in API strategy across an organization. The benefits of internal and partner layers approaches to transparency, as well as public transparency helps break down silos. Think about the separations between some of the other groups in your organization, and possibly with your leadership up the ladder. Would it help if the road map for your team was out in the open for anyone within your company to follow? Would conversations around outages and system stability be more productive if they included a wider group--maybe preventing some of the micro aggression that occur behind closed doors?&nbsp; There are many, many ways API can bring transparency to your organization, way before you ever consider doing it publicly. When I say API, this starts with the technical endpoints, but a modern API conversation ALWAYS involves documentation, code, communications, and feedback loops. The Amazon Web Services family of APIs isn't just purely about the compute and storage endpoints.

			<p><em>16 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I have been working for a month or so on what some of the common tasks that developer advocates and evangelists would like to see occur around their API operations. These are small little tasks that evangelists should be doing themselves, but if they can encourage their own API community, or the wider developer and tech community to help out, they might achieve a greater reach. Getting your community to help out with tasks on your platform is nothing new. This is a core premise of modern web API operations, something that can work well in some ecosystems, but has historically been abused by other ecosystems. Some API providers enjoy vibrant communities where developers are more than happy to step up and build things for free, generate a buzz, and show up to events. The reality for most is that it can be very hard to stimulate developers to help in any way, and resort to the exploration of other ways they can stimulate this activity. As I was exploring these concepts with fellow evangelist, soliciting ideas for what some of the common tasks evangelist might need, someone brought up how sleezy this sounds. Are you going to give away swag, gift cards, or money for these tasks? Are you going to do it for points? I agree, on the surface, when you describe it like that, it does sound cheezy, if not sleezy. Then I got thinking about the micro transactions and tasks people ask of me on a regular basis--things like: Writing Blog Posts Retweeting a Link Voting Up Something on &nbsp;Hacker News Voting Up Something on Product Hunt Write a Code Sample Build a Prototype Integration Comment On a Discussion Create a Visualization Participate in a Webinar Keynote a Conference Participate In Discussion Write a White Paper Provide a Quote Talk To Reporter Talk To Analyst These are some of the common requests I get.

			<p><em>16 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I was going through the SendGrid API and profiling their available plans and pricing, using my new API plan tracking format, and I just have to stop and say--I wish everyone would present their pricing pages as simply as SendGrid does. I cannot speak to whether their pricing is good, fair, or otherwise, but the layout, and the way they explain it, is very simple straightforward and easy to make sense of.
In addition to having the pricing for their email API broke down into six coherent plan tiers, they also have a compare plan details table which shows all six plans, side by side, with each core feature, and other elements of API access available to browse. As an API analyst, it make the data entry for my API tracking much easier, but as an API consumer it make it much easier for me to budget for the API driven resources I will need as part of my API operations.

The state of your pricing page tells a lot about how baked your overall API strategy. I will be the first to admit my own API plans and pricing are half-baked at best. I'm still trying to figure out what I want to be, the value of my resources, and what the market will bear--my pricing page reflects and amplifies this dilemma. This is something I am determined to get into order, as I continue to push forward my API plan research.

			<p><em>16 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I like my API service providers like I like my APIs, doing one thing and doing it well. Sure services can work together (using APIs), and companies can launch multiple services, but I prefer selecting the services that I use as part of my API operations, as small, modular pieces of API infrastructure. In my opinion, API service providers are just another class of API provider, they just happen to be selling services to businesses that are operating APIs. You can see this in action with API Docs, part of the StopLight.io platform. API Docs does one thing well--API documentation! Although for me, it touches on two important areas of the API lifecycle, both documentation and definitions, but also illustrates the maturation of these stops along the API life cycle, since Tony first launched Swagger UI. The StopLight team is taking API definitions to the next level, but they are also helping us better deliver the documentation portion of our API life cycle(s)--all driven by API definitions. (meta) If you are looking for another example of this in action, take a look at API transformer, from the APIMATIC team. APIMATIC alone fits my definition of a modular API service provider, doing SDKs, and doing the well, but then you factor in their API translation tooling. #winning Again, APIMATIC is focusing on modular services, that are API definition driven--very similar to what StopLight is up to with their strategy.&nbsp; In 2016 you will hear me hammer on three key concepts when it comes to delivering services in the API space, and selling to indivivdual API providers. 1) do one thing and do it well, 2) speak in API definition formats, and 3) do it with APIs!! It isn't rocket surgery that API service providers should be practicng what they preach, but in 2016 I am finding that these three characteristics are proving to be a reliable way for me to differentiate the API service providers who...[<a href="/2016/02/16/i-am-liking-the-modular-services-that-are-delivering-in-specific-areas-of-api-life-cycle-like-apidocs-io/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>Stoplight.io is a very cool new API modeling and proxy tool. I just wrote a post about the overall features of the platform, but I wanted to zoom in on a specific benefit that Stoplight.io brings to the table--the auto generation of OpenAPI Specs, for the mobile apps you depend on, as you use them. To understand the process in detail, I recommend watching the how was this created video on the Peach API documentation generated by Stoplight.io. When you download the Stoplight API designer for Mac (available on the account dashboard), you get the Prism API Proxy, which allows you to easily route all the traffic from your Macbook, as well as iPhone and IPad, through the platform. Once you create a new API, add the base URL for the API you are profiling, StoplLight does the rest, automatically generating an OpenAPI Spec, and attractive API documentation in the application, in real time as you watch--it is pretty cool to watch once you have turned on. Why do I want to do this? Well first of all, I am someone who has spent five years traveling around the world wearing the same t-shirt evangelizing APIs to everyone who will listen--obviously I have a number of problems. Beyond that, I'm fascinated by the API design practices of the leading "dark APIs" I use everyday, but rather than doing so via a public API program, it is via a mobile device. I'm fascinated by this layer of the API sector, one that is fueling all of the API growth we are seeing, but getting a much smaller portion of the conversation that is dominated by leading public APIs.&nbsp; To help me learn about what is possible with StopLight, I profiled the APIs that LinkedIn and Instagram mobile applications used. It took me about 15 minutes to go through each application, and hit publish on the documentation you see published to API Docs. I feel that there...[<a href="/2016/02/16/generating-openapi-specs-for-the-mobile-apps-you-depend-on-just-by-using-them/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>After I've talked about my mapping of the public, and mobile APIs with various folks over the last couple of months, I can usually put folks into one of three camps 1) they do not understand what the hell I am talking about and could care less, wishing the geek dude would shut up 2) thinks its a really interesting idea and worth exploring and discussing, or 3) they express concern, and liken it to scraping, and even hacking. I can understand folks not caring because they don't grasp it technically, but I do not fully yet grasp why people express concern, and think its wrong that I am mapping out, and wanting to discuss this layer of our digital world(s). As I was working with the new features in Stoplight.io last night, profiling some of the applications on my mobile phone's desktop, I spent some more time thinking about this topic. I find it fascinating that companies do not consider the APIs they use to drive mobile applications as public infrastructure, when I can sit in my living room, and engage with them over the public Internet. i find it even more fascinating that some folks consider what I do as contributing to securing problems, when I map these APIs out, share and discuss them on the open Internet.&nbsp; I am not intercepting anyone's traffic, or hacking anyone's systems. I am simply using a publicly available mobile application I found in the app store, and I am interested in understanding how leading companies are designing their APIs. Next I'm interested in discussing how these APIs compare with the same companies public API infrastructure, or possibly why a company does not have a publicly available API program. After that, I am also looking for a better understanding around which of my life bits (and others) are being transported as part of my daily mobile app usage.&nbsp; I've heard many arguments on why this public infrastructure...[<a href="/2016/02/16/concern-around-mapping-and-discussing-shadow-mobile-apis-shows-signs-of-an-imbalance/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I stayed up way too late playing with some of the new features in Stoplight.io. If you aren't familiar with what the Stoplight team has been cooking up--they have been hard at work crafting a pretty slick set of API modeling tools. I feel the platform provides me with a new way to look at the API life cycle--a perspective that spans multiple dimensions, including design, definition, virtualization, documentation, testing, discovery, orchestration, and client.&nbsp; Stoplight.io gives me a pretty powerful platform for managing, interfacing, sharing, collaborating, publishing, understanding, and evolving my API designs and definitions. You can begin modeling your APIs by importing an existing OpenAPI Spec, RAML, or Postman collection, or get to work modeling a new or existing API via the Stoplight client interface, which is just one tool in the Stoplight modeling toolbox. Additionally, I am able to create separate work spaces and import the OpenAPI Spec for all my own APIs, as well as the&nbsp;APIs that I depend on in the API space&nbsp;&lt; this organization is very important to me. Stoplight.io provides me with a new way to approach the organization of my API design and definitions, but the biggest impact for me, is when it comes to modeling the existing APIs out there. I've been working on automating the generation of OpenAPI Spec definitons of the APIs I use, as I use them--something that is two separate tasks at the moment. Stoplight.io does this, but does it waaaay better than what I have been doing, quietly crafting the OpenAPI Spec for any API I am using, in the background when you have Stoplight API discovery mode turned on, and the Prism API Proxy on. I am enjoying the view of the API space that Stoplight.io is giving me. I got completely lost last night improving on my API designs, profiling other APIs in the space that were already in my work queue, and mapping out the dark APIs behind the...[<a href="/2016/02/16/automagically-defining-your-api-infrastructure-as-you-work-using-stoplight-io/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I have had multiple conversations with folks in the space who are building services and tooling for the API sector lately, where I was asked whether or not they should only be using existing API definition formats, or create their own API definition format that better represents what they are delivering. The reasoning is usually that they feel their own format would offer a more comprehensive approach than any single, existing API definition could--yet they fully understand the potential for adoption when they use existing formats like OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint. My answer to them, is you deliver d) All The Above. I fully get that you will have your own unique view of the API space, and of what your tools and services will deliver, so you should be defining your own schema, but that you also can't ignore what is happening with OpenAPI Spec annd API Blueprint either. There is a groundswell of services, tooling, and savvy API architects and developers using these existing API definition formats, and you do not want to be an island in this very connected sea. Some examples of this already in motion can be found with APIMATIC and Runscope. Both of these providers fluently speak multiple existing API definition formats, but they also have their own, custom format for describing what their service(s) brings to the table. I'd say the one difference is that Runscope is more focused on their own format, emphasizing the import / export in the Runscope version, while APIMATIC is holding their version behind the scenes and emphasizing the use the existing API definition format of their own. I think it is important that service providers flex both their own spec, as well as supporting existing formats like these providers do, even if it is just by using the API Transformer service. However, there is also an opportunity at the intersection of these two worlds with the x- extension for OpenAPI Spec....[<a href="/2016/02/16/as-an-api-service-provider-should-i-craft-my-own-api-definition-format-or-just-reuse-what-is-already-available/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I'm spending some time going through v2 docs for the Zapier API, following the release of multi steps work flows, and code steps for calculating, converting, and manipulating data and content, last week. While IFTTT gets a significant amount of the attention of the API reciprocity platforms I track on, I feel like Zapier is the most successful, and reflects most of what I'd lie to see in an API driven integration, and automation platform--specifically, the fact they have an API. Along with keeping track of what Zapier is up to, I'm spending more time thinking about the increasing number of API driven bot platforms I'm seeing emerge, and API enabled voice platforms like Alexa Voice Service. As I was reading Zapier's platform documentation, I couldn't help but see what I'd consider to be the essential building blocks for any integration, automation, and reciprocity platform emerge: Authentication - Providing the mechanisms for the most common approaches to API authentication, including basic auth, digest auth, session based, oAuth. Triggers - Provide the framework to use verbs and nouns, with help text, and webhook infrastructure to trigger anything users will desire. Actions - Provide the framework to use verbs and nouns, with help text, and webhook infrastructure to accomplish an action users will desire. Searches -Allowing for simple questions to be asked, and provide a framework to allow APIs to e employed in answering any question asked. Webhooks - Putting the automation in API integration, allowing for webhooks that can be triggered, and used as part of actions. Notification - Using notifications throughout the process to keep the platform, developers, and end-users informed about anything that is relevant. Scripting - Allowing for code integration for calculating, converting, and manipulating data as part of any step of the process. Multi-step - Going beyond just just triggers and actions, and allowing for multi-step workflows that put multiple APIs to use.

			<p><em>15 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I just finished looking through the documentation for the Zapier API, and for the Alex Voice Service, trying to understand the approach these platforms are taking to incorporate API driven resources into their services. How do you translate a single API call into a Zapier trigger or action? How do you build a rich index of resources for Alexa to search via voice commands? Learning how APIs are being consumed, or can be consume, is an infinitely fascinating journey for me, and something I enjoy researching.&nbsp;
All of my research into reciprocity, bots, and voice enablement via APIs, makes me think more about experience based API design, trumping much of the resource based dogma that has domnated much of the conversation. How will my APIs enable meaningful interoperability via Zapier, voice searches via Alexa, and stimulate interesting bot interactions? I am not just focusing on how my resources are defined, I am now also forced to think about how they will be searched, consumed, and put to use in these new client experiences.&nbsp;
Just like mobile significantly shaped how we craft our APis, automation, voice, bots, and increasingly Internet connected devices will continue to define our API strategies. Users, and developers will increasingly small, meaningful resources that they can use to orchestrate their personal and business lives, that will respond to simple voice commands at home, in the car, and via our mobile devices. When we are designing our APIs, are we thinking about these bite-size resources that will be needed in this emerging bot and voice driven evolution in the API space.

			<p><em>15 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I shared a list of just the essential building blocks from across only 21 areas of my API areas of the API life cycle with a company I'm helping craft an API strategy for, and I got some very common feedback--all this information is great, but where do I start with my API strategy? This is excellent feedback, as that particular overview is void of any specific 101, or on-boarding elements for each of the areas of the API life cycle that I cover.&nbsp; This is on purpose for this particular document, providing me with a generic outline that I can use in many different scenarios, but the feedback rings loud in my ears, and is something I get constantly. I receive a constant barrage of emails, tweets, and voice mails asking me where they should get started with their API strategy, spanning both the provider, and consumer side of the API coin.&nbsp; The problem for me in all of this is that what "API" means, where someone is at in their journey, and what their overall goals are, can be radically different depending on who you talk to. What API design means to you, may not be what it means to the next. What API deployment might be about gateway solutions in your organizations, for others it means cloud based, or possibly specifically with a Java API framework like Restlet. My goal in my research is to to map out each area, distill down the common building blocks, then yes, build as many introductions (101), and on-boarding doorways as I can, targeting both API provider and consumers, across a wide variety of business sectors, and the public sphere. To help illustrate my point, I get regular requests from folks around how do they pull all the data on Twitter via the API, and how do publish a video to all the leading video platforms via APIs.

			<p><em>13 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>A couple of weeks ago I started playing with a machine readable way to describe the pricing, and plans available for an API. I spent a couple of days looking through over 50 APIs, and how they handled the pricing, and their API access plans, and gathered the details in a master list, which I am using for my master definition. I picked up this work, and moved it forward over the last two days, further solidifying the schema, as well as launching an API, and set of admin tools for me to use. While my primary objective is to help me establish a machine readable definition that I can use to describe the plans of the APIs I provide, as well as the ones that I monitor as part of my regular work in the space--I needed an easier way to help me track the details of each API's plan. So I got to work creating an simple, yet robust admin tool that allows me to add one or many plans, for each API that I track on.&nbsp; To help me drive this administrative interface I needed an API (of course), that would allow me to add, edit, and delete the details for each plan, using my API plan schema as a guide. I got to work designing, developing, and launched the first beta version of my API plans API, to help me gather, and organize the details for any API I want, whether its mine, or one of the many public APIs I track on. Now that I have an API, and an administrative interface, I'm going to get to work adding the data I gathered from my previous research. I have almost 60 APIs to enter, then I hope to be able to step back, and see the API plan data Ive gathered in a new light. Once I get to this stage, I'm looking to craft a simple embeddable page for...[<a href="/2016/02/13/my-tooling-and-api-for-gathering-and-organizing-the-details-of-the-plans-and-pricing-for-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Evaluating exactly what is the "right" API can be very difficult. This is what I do full time, and its hard for me to understand the differences--I cannot image what it is like for people who have real jobs. I've used both the Crunchbase API, and the AngelList API for some time now, to help me better profile the companies that I am paying attention to as part of my research. I use both the website, and API for both of these business data platforms on a regular basis.&nbsp; As I read about the recent investment in Crunchbase, and their changes in pricing, I'm reminded of my half finished work, incorporating the OpenCorporates API, and taking another look at all of my business data sources. I won't be able to afford Crunchbase after the changes, which will suck, but honestly I'm not a big fan of their overall operations, and approach, and happy to see the data source leave the stack of APis that I depend on.&nbsp; This leaves me assessing what is next, as any major API plan changes will do to consumers. In addition to needing the data behind each company I monitor in the API space, I need a public page to reference across my storytelling. It is unfortunate that I've used Crunchbase for this historically. In an effort to keep my readers informed, I've also been supporting the very closed (and increasingly so) platform. When I pick up my business API integration work, I will switch off Crunchbase, keep my AngelList feed, and turn on OpenCorporates, but I will also start using the public OpenCorporates page as the URL reference I use in my storytelling.&nbsp; For me, it is important to find the resources I need to run my business, but it is also important to support services that have healthy practices.

			<p><em>10 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>
One reason for having a well thought out, comprehensive API strategy, is that you are thinking about all the moving parts, and at ever turn you can weave things together, and potentially amplify the forward motion of your API operations. With every new release you should be considering all other areas of your API strategy, how you can include your API consumers, your partners, and where all of the opportunities lie when it comes to evangelism, and storytelling.
This approach was present in the latest release from Postman, with the release of their Run in Postman, embeddable button. As part of the release of the new embeddable button for their API client tooling, Postman also made a call for partners. It was a savvy marketing technique to reach out to partners like this, something that will not just generate implementations in the wild, but will also establish new partnerships, strengthen existing ones, while also generating new blog posts, and press releases around API platform operations.
When it comes to the API Evangelist operations, the approach by Postman is gold--when I consider across many areas of my own strategy. Postman is showcased as part of my API client research, their product release exists within my embeddable API research, and also lives within my API evangelism and API partners research. The moral of this story is Postman thought across their strategy when crafting the release strategy for their new feature, and I also put in similiar thoughts across my own strategy while reading their blog post, giving us both an opportunity for establishing biggest bang possible, around a single API platform release.

			<p>I was in Philadelphia last week, hanging out with educational technology practitioners, and at one of the dinners I found myself talking to a young lady who was a digital learning assistant at a university. She spent her days, helping administrators, and faculty, when it came to understanding what digital resources and tooling were available, and assisting them to better understand how they can put them to use in their daily work.&nbsp; This conversation left me thinking about the role I play in the API space. I long ago elevated myself above evangelizing any single APIs, a position I enjoy because of my partners 3Scale, Cloud Element, Restlet, and WSO2. I elevated myself into this role because I saw nobody else doing it across the space, and saw an opportunity to make a wider impact, beyond just peddling a single product or service. My conversation in Philly made me realize how much general API assistant I am in my daily operations.&nbsp; The role of an API assistant, helping others understand that APIs exist, and how they can be applied in our everyday personal and business lives is an increasingly critical role in our society. How do you teach people they can pull corporate data from OpenCorporates, or Tweets from a specific #hashtag into a Google Spreadsheet? How do you help people understand that APIs make the everyday exhaust from your world organize-able", accessible, and more "orchestrate-able", via APIs--without knowing how to code! I've talked about my work as an API broker, where I help organize coherent stacks of APIs, for potential use in specific business verticals, and web, mobile, or even device based applications. I'm adding API assistance to this spectrum now, because an API broker addresses the professional business side of the API equation, but an API assistance addresses the individual side of the API equation.

			<p><em>08 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I look at a lot of APIs, and one characteristic I judge them by, is their ability to simply explain what their API does. The most import aspect to any individual or company when doing APIs, is the process can potentially bring you out of your bubble, and make you think a little bit more externally.&nbsp;
One of the most common things I see from API providers, is they think it terms of, and present their API in the context of the language they program in. It is a ".NET Web API", or a Python API. When in reality it is a web API, and if it employs enough HTTP, it should be able to be consumed in any language.
Another regular mistake made by API providers, is they describe their API in terms of their own platform, and never actually tell you what it does. Here is an example of this from PushBullet:
Pushbullet's API enables developers to build on the Pushbullet infrastructure. Our goal is to provide a full API that enables anything to tap into the Pushbullet network.
While I appreciate the short description of what the API does, I'm left still not knowing what it does. You see, I do not know about Pushbullet like you do, and chances are neither will many of your other potential API consumers. Knowing about your company shouldn't get in the way of me learning about what your API does.
To me, this is classic walled silo-itis, where programmers are operating within their little company or tech silo, and don't look much further. That is ok, this is why we do APis, to help break you free of these cycles.&nbsp;

			<p><em>07 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I am continuing to push forward my API plans research, where I look closely at the common building blocks of the service composition, pricing, and plans available for some of the leading API providers out there. I have no less than ten separate stories derived from Algolia, the search API provider's, pricing page--I will be using Algolia as a reference for how to plan your API, along with elder API pioneers like Amazon, and Twilio, for some time now. On area of Algolia's approach I think is worth noting, is the enterprise level of their operations. They provide the most detail regarding what you get as part of the enterprise tier, being very public about their operations, in a way you just do not see with many API providers. When it comes down to it, the Algolia enterprise search plans are all about no limitations--I think their description says it well: Your own dedicated infrastructure. Don't like limits? Meet our dedicated clusters. Optimal for high volumes of data, they scale to thousands of queries per second. Search performance and indexing times have never been so good. The basic building blocks of how Algolia is monetizing their search API, records and operation API calls, melt away at the enterprise level. The lower four plans for Algolia API access meter the number of record, and operation API calls you make, and charge consumers, using four separate pricing levels. If you are an enterprise customer, the need for this metering melts away, eliminating the default limitations applied to lower levels of API consumption. I support more transparency in enterprise API plans, as well as other partner tiers of access. I do not think Algolia's approach to delivering enterprise services is unique, but their straightforward, simple, and transparent approach to doing it is. In an API driven world, the enterprise levels of access do not always have to be that age old mating dance, that involves smoke and mirrors,...[<a href="/2016/02/07/it-is-all-about-no-limitations-with-the-enterprise-api-plans/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>06 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>
The popular API client tool Postman just launched an embeddable "run in Postman" button, that you can use to fast track integration with your API(s). Shortly after I wrote a post about the importance of API definition driven embeddable tools for API service providers, Postman contacted me and said, "hey! we are already working on that!" ;-)
With the latest update, when you use your Postman Client, you can generate some embeddable JavaScript, which you can then post alongside your API documentation, throughout your developer portal, or possibly anywhere on the open web. Something that could trim minutes, or even hours off the time it takes for new developers to go from discovery to integration.
Embeddable tooling for APIs is nothing new, something we've seen leading providers like Twitter and Facebook employ successfully, but it is something that is fairly new for API service providers. Having a robust embeddable strategy like this one from Postman, and last week's example from SDK provider APIMATIC, is something all API service providers should be considering in 2016.

			<p><em>05 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>One of the approaches to API plans I was studying recently is from the data provider Factual, who provides access to places, products, and other valuable data-sets. I felt Factual had a pretty straightforward approach to the free tier of access for their platform, that was worthy of sharing. When you visit the page for the Factual data services, they offer two distinct levels of free access to data resources: Free (unverified) -&nbsp;Up to 100 read requests per day. No access to resolve or write APIs. Free (verified) -&nbsp;Up to 10,000 requests per day for most tables. When I look at the plans for many APIs, they almost always have free tiers of access, but normally there is just one dimension to it. You get a certain amount of API calls per second, day, or month, for free. What is unique about the approach from Factual is they offer another free level, which gives you more API calls if you verify yourself--this is a pretty interesting approach, that other providers should consider. You want free access, but don't want to verify yourself, and you get 100 red requests per day, but if you go through the verification process, you get 10,000 requests per day--a pretty significant difference. I am talking with a number of providers lately about how they are tightening up the free tiers of API access, and working to incentivize users to become paying customers, which made me take another look at Factual's approach. I think free access to APIs is essential to operations, but I think providers need to be more thoughtful about just how much of their resources they give away at this tier. It is OK if you want to get to know your consumers, before you give away too much of the farm. There can be a lot of bad behavior from API consumers at the free tier level, and developer verification is one way you can minimize the...[<a href="/2016/02/05/different-api-rate-limits-for-verified-and-unverified-free-tiers-of-access/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>05 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I have been working hard for about a year now trying to craft machine readable API definitions for the leading APIs out there. I've written before about my use of Charles Proxy to generate OpenAPI Spec files, something I'm evolving over the last couple days, making it more automated, and hopefully making my mapping of the API universe much more efficient. Hand crafting even the base API definition for any API is time consuming, which is something that swells quickly to being hours when you consider the finish work that required, so I was desperately looking how I could automate this aspect of my operations more. I have two modes when looking at an API, review mode where I'm documenting the API and its surrounding operations, with the second being about actually using the API. While I will still be reviewing APIs, my goal is to immediately begin actually using an API, where I feel most of the value is at, while also kicking off the documentation process in the same motion. Logging All Of My Traffic Using Charles Proxy On MachineUsing Charles Proxy, I route all of my network traffic on my Macbook Pro through a single proxy which I am in control of, allowing me to log every Internet location my computer visits throughout the day. It is something I cannot leave running 100% of the time, as it breaks certificates, sets of security warnings from a number of destinations, but is something I can run about 75% of my world through--establishing a pretty interesting map of the resources I consume, and produce on each day.&nbsp; Auto Saving Charles Proxy Session Files Every 30 MinutesWhile running running Charles Proxy, I have it setup to auto save a session XML every 30 minutes, giving me bite size snapshots of transaction throughout my day.

			<p><em>04 Feb 2016</em></p>
			<p>I am continuing to work through notes from a recent push forward of my API monetization, and API plan research. Something that yielded a number of valuable nuggets &nbsp;that I think API providers should be considering when crafting their own strategy. One of the pricing pages I was looking at as part of my research, was from authentication provider Auth0, which provided a nice way for allowing their customers to toggle between monthly or annual pricing.

I organize small elements like this, into my lists of common API building blocks, which help API providers, and API service providers, with a list of things they can consider applying in their own strategies. I like the approach from Auth0 especially, because the toggle actually changes the plan pricing on the page, reflecting the shorter, or longer term costs associated with their authentication services.
Whether your intent is to offer price breaks for longer term relationships, or helping your customers better understand and manage their costs, a simple thing like a time-frame toggle, that adjusts pricing, could make a positive impact. Anyhoo, I just wanted to share this nugget with you, as I was adding it as a building block to my API plan research.

While I will still be my usual self and call out the worst behavior in the space, I am also going to try and be a little more friendlier around my views, and try and help bring more options to the table. This is a serious problem, nobody is talking about, and one that has many dimensions and nuances--if you want my raw stance on API patents, you can read it here.&nbsp; One area I wanted to try and cover, in response to my friends trying to convince me their aren't bad people, in having patents. I know you aren't, and it isn't my goal to make you look bad in this, it is only to shine light on the entire process, how broken it is, and call out the worst offenders. If you truly believe in patents, protecting the work you've done, and that your intentions are good, share your patent portfolio with the world, and showcase it like you do the other aspects of the work you do. You will craft a press release about everything else you do, do the same for your patents.&nbsp; I do not think patents are bad. I think ill-conceived patent ideas, that haven't been properly vetted by the under resourced USPTO, that are used in back door dealings as leverage, and litigated in a court of law are bad. I'll take your word that your patents are good, and you aren't operating in any of these areas, if you are public, transparent, and openly proud of them, as you state in private conversations.

			<p><em>29 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>The mobile backend as a service (MBaaS) platform Parse is shutting down. I started tracking on Parse as part of my BaaS research a couple years back, something that resulted in having all of the BaaS providers, including Ilya Sukhar (@) of Parse, on stage at @APIStrat NYC in early 2013--this conversation was just a couple months before Parse was acquired by Facebook.&nbsp; Parse was widely consider to be the top BaaS platform, which resulted in wide adoption, something that I'm sure grew expoentitally after the purchase by Facebook. Parse is giving everyone a year to migrate, providing a database migration tool, as well as open sourcing a version of the platform. Which I think is a pretty fair deprecation strategy for customers, even with the unexpected news. Despite the tec highway is littered with these types of acquisitions, and deprecations, the tech blogosphere, and social bookmarkosphere (is that a word?), loves to sqawk when these happen. Competitors like AWS, Google, and others love to invite you to come use their platform, and the technorati love to point out how you cannot depend on any platform--which is the truth.&nbsp; Personally, I enjoy taking these moments to explore why the space think technology is such an asbsolute, where these ways of thought rarely exist in other sectors.&nbsp;I think there are a couple distinct things at play: Promises Of Tech Providers - In an effort to get new users, tech solution providers make some pretty wild promises of how they'll make your life easier, do all the hard work for you, all you have to do is just believe in them. Never mentioning you aren't really their true target customer, an acquisition by big tech company is their true customer.

			<p><em>29 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>If you caught my keynotes at @Defrag and @APIStrat last year, you know I'm working on using the subway map as a method for visualizing, understand, and eventually exploration of the API life cycle. I feel like the subway map concept, has helped us find a globally universal way of understanding the transport of humans, via some very complex transportation systems, in cities around the globe--something I feel can be applied to world of APIs. I was giving a version of my API life cycle talk to a group in Finland the other evening (their morning), and someone in the audience sent me a link to the real-time subway map for Helsinki. If you watch it closely, it updates based upon where the trains are, sharing times and locations.&nbsp; Click To See Real Interactive Map This is what I'm working for across the API space. I see the subway map analogy being key to understanding our API life cycle, across the 40+ areas I track on in my research, as well as a potential real-time window to understanding how each API is being used by employing modern API management infrastructure like 3Scale. API providers (which ALL companies will be shortly) should have real-time windows into where each of their vital API resources are in the life cycle, whether they are being designed, developed, managed or deprecated. We should also be able to experience real-time views of how are APIs are being consumed, which apps are currently making calls, and potentially even security threats against our API infrastructure. The subway map is also providing me a way to educate new, and existing API folks in the space, providing them with an interactive journey within the design, definition, deployment, management, monitoring, and 40+ other areas of the API life cycle I keep an eye on. I'm optimistic for what is possible, when it comes to applying the subway map concept to the world of APIs, but like...[<a href="/2016/01/29/my-vision-for-one-possible-future-of-the-api-life-cycle-present-in-a-realtime-subway-map-for-helsinki/">Read More</a>]</p>

Supporting your community is not unique to the API space, but supporting API operations does have some unique needs, and approaches that are proven by leading platforms. Like other areas of my research, I'm pulling out API support into its own area, so I can start shining a light on successful patterns I find in the area of API support.
Two things pushed me to spin out this research area. One, I was tagging more blog posts, and other resources as support, and without a dedicated research area, this information would rarely float to the surface for me. Two, my partners over at Cloud Elements have an API hub dedicated to "Help Desk". While their aggregate API solution is targeting beyond the API community, it is API driven, and can also be applied to providing an aggregate support solution for API communities.
As with most of the areas of the API space, there are several dimensions to how APIs are being applied to support customers, and online communities. With my research, I will focus on tracking on approaches to community support for API providers, and API service providers. There will also be that layer of tracking on help desk and support platforms who employ APIs, as well as API aggregate and API interoperability solutions from leaders (and my partners) in the space like Cloud Elements.
You can visit my API support research via its Github repository, and I will try to make sure and continue linking to it from my API management research, where it was born out of.

In a collective response to these conversations, I wanted to share my stance on patents, when it comes to the world of APIs. Let's start closer to the median, and talk about patents, and the world that "exists today", and explore the common responses when you look to discuss API patents in the current climate. I Do Not Want To Do Patents, I Only Do Them As a Defensive Response!C'mon Kin! You do not understand why we have to do patents. We only do them to protect our space, against the worst, of the worst in the tech space--you know SAP, Sun, Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, and the other evil that lurk (the ones with most patents).

			<p>I'm seeing a resurgence in my embeddable API research lately, based upon signals I'm seeing across the space, and conversations I'm having with folks. The interesting part for me is that this wave isn't about API providers like Twitter and Faceobok using JavaScript to create buttons, badges, and widgets. This latest round is about API service providers making their services more accessible to both API providers, and API consumers, using embeddable tooling, and most importantly, API definitions. API driven embeddable tools comes in many shapes and sizes, but is something I work hard to understand, and track on in the space. I have several new embeddable stories to talk about this week, but today's is from my friends over at APIMATIC, as well as Apiary. The two service providers now offer the ability to embed your APIMATIC driven SDKs, into your Apiary driven API documentation. All you do, is plug in the URL of your Apiary portal page for your API, into your APIMATC account, and you are returned embeddable markdown you can paste into your Apiary API documentation--Apiary addresses your API design, documentation, testing and virtualization needs, and APIMATIC comes is with the API SDK assist.&nbsp; I like API service providers working together like this, it is something that makes API provider's and API consumer's lives easier. This approach to API service interoperability is what it will take to weave together the patchwork of API services that will be needed across the API life cycle. As more API service providers emerge to fill gaps in the life cycle, the ability to stitch these stops will grow more critical, something embeddability will contribute to. Depending on a single provider in 2016, is just not a reality, and I need the services that I depend on to work together. As I will work to showcase in future stories, embedability comes in many shapes and sizes.

			<p>I held a hangout with API Evangelist this morning, with Steve Willmot (@njyx) of @3scale, &amp; Jakub Nesetril (@jakubnesetril) of @apiaryio&nbsp;today, where we discussed API definitions. Both Steve and Jakub are CEOs of leading tech companies, who are taking frontline positions when it comes to the whole API definition conversation. My role in this hangout, was just bringing together these two API leaders, to discuss the most important topic facing us in the world of APIs. API definitions are touching on every aspect of the API life cycle, and as Steve and Jakub discuss, playing a central role in their businesses, and their customer's businesses. We published the hour and half conversation on Youtube, so you can join in, even if you couldn't make the hangout. &nbsp; &nbsp; The focus on API definitions being the contract, was the most important part of today's hangout for me. This wasn't a conversation about just Swagger, or API Blueprint, it was a discussion about the role API definitions play in the API life cycle, from the latest wave of API description formats like Swagger and Blueprint, to API discovery formats like APIs.json, and even media types, and schemas. These are the contracts we are using to communicate our ideas, generate code, setup tests, drive documentation, and make the API economy go roudn. This hangout was scheduled to be an hour, but there was so much to cover, we took it an extra 30 minutes. The conversation left me feeling like I need to do this more often, expanding on the API definition discussion, but also push into other important areas like API deployment, virtualization, discovery, monitoring, and the other almost 40 areas of the API lifecycle I track on. We'll see how much time i have to do these, but more importantly my ability to bring smart people like Steve and Jakub together--something I hope I can make it work.

			<p>As I work to complete more API definitions, with all API endpoints defined as an OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, and Postman Collection, with everything wrapped in a complete APIs.json index--I can't help but consider the importance of these definitions in helping others reverse engineer these APIs, to help apply in their own API design, development, and management processes. Whether or not you are learning about an API for consumption purposes, or learning about it from a providers perspective, there is a lot to learn from APIs that are defined using&nbsp;OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, and Postman Collection, and is something I'm working to push APIs.json to deliver on more. Right now I'm struggling to just get the basics of each API, its individual methods, parameters, and underlying schemas. I am also working to index their overall operations using APIs.json. Soon though, I will reach the point where I will have a nice collection of existing APIs defined, I will be able to do much, much more--this is what I'm planning for now. Now that I am closing in on having a couple hundred, complete (enough) API definitions for leading platforms, I think I will take another look through the stack, and evaluate how I can position them better to help potential API consumers, as well as API providers. API consumers are going to care about learning only what they need to get at the valuable resources made available via the API, while providers are going to want to better understand the API design, schemas, business models, and other aspects of the operations. I'm thinking more deeply the API provider and API consumer sides of the same coin, so when you land on the home page of any API service provider, there is personalized, easy to use, visual elements that draw you in to learn more about an existing API you already know about. Want to learn how to connect to APIs using Postman, here is a...[<a href="/2016/01/25/reverse-engineering-apis-from-the-common-apis-models-we-know/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>25 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>There are many inconsistencies I struggle with in the API space, and the lack of meaningful icons to express myself is one of them. I was meeting with my friend Jerome Louvel of Restlet this last week, and he also articulated (again), the lack of imagery that represents APIs. To understand what we are talking about simple icons, like what RSS has, but to represent an API, instead of an XML feed. When I need an image to represent an API, I always borrow the simple icon from the API Commons. Like my API Evangelist logo, it is a pretty simple, black and white, minimum viable representation of "API". The folks over at Restlet also have their own, image, that they use across the platform, and suggested it as one potential design that could be used. This is a concept that I would like to push forward. I think branding, and iconography is very important, and is something long overdue for the API space. I would like to see a single universal, community driven icon to represent the concept of a web API. I would also like to see similar icons for formats used across the space, as well as vendor specific icons. If you look at my personal API stack, as well as my overall stack, you see me using a mix of format, and vendor icons to document a pretty complex assortment of API driven resources, and information. I'd like to step this up a bit, be able to standardize across not just my network of sites, but the overall API community.&nbsp; I am guessing this is something I will have to slowly push forward, like the numerous other areas of my API industry research, but would love to hear your input, and see what else we could do to establish a common set of API industry icons.

			<p><em>25 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>
Join me, Steve Willmott(@njyx) of 3Scale, and Jakub Nesetril(@jakubnesetril) of Apiary, for a hangout on API definitions this week. I wanted to explore&nbsp; doing more hangouts under the APIStrat, as well as API Evangelist brand(s)--for this one I wanted to bring together some experts to talk about the fast moving world of API definitions, as a Hangout with API Evangelist.
This Wednesday, January 27th, at 11:00 AM PST, the three of us will jump on a Google Hangout, and you are welcome to join in the conversation. We will be doing the gathering as a Hangout on Air, so that you can ask questions if you want, joining in the live conversation, or you can wait until after we are done, I will make sure and publish the video to Youtube.

Its a pretty important time for API definitions with the Swagger specification reborn as the OpenAPISpec, and Apiary, the creator of API Blueprint and MSON, also adopting OpenAPI Spec this last week, allowing you to design and mock your API in both formats. 3Scale was an earlier adopter of Swagger, and has taken a leadership position in shepherding it to into the Linux Foundation, and is a member of the governance working group.
I figured that it is a pretty good time to check-in with Steve and Jakub, on the current state of API definitions, and how they see them impacting their own platforms, as well as the overall API space. If you have any specific questions you'd like me to ask, or have any specific topics you'd like to see discussed, feel free to tweet at me. I'll tweet out the link for the event, but all you need to do is visit hangoutwith.apievangelist.com, this Wednesday at 11:00 PST, and join in the conversation.

			<p><em>25 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I am happy to be showcasing a new open source, OpenAPI Spec driven, interactive API documentation, from the LucyBot team. The API definition driven documentation solution is one of the best implementations I've seen to date, and reflects the future of where API documentation should be going in my opinion. While the Swagger UI has significantly moved the API documentation conversation forward, it has never been the most attractive solution, pushing some API providers to use a more attractive, less interactive, open source solution from Slate.
The LucyBot API Console is both! It is API definition driven, using the OpenAPI Spec as its engine, but also provides a conversion tool for RAML, WADL, or API Blueprint. The LucyBot API Console is also very attractive, responsive, and flows much like Slate does, but goes much further by being an actual interactive API console, not just good looking, static docs. You can see Lucy Console in action over at AnyAPI, or as a small set that demonstrates different CSS variations.&nbsp;
I have forked, and started playing with the LucyBot API Console more--I encourage you to do the same. There are a number of features I'd like to see in there, like more embeddability, and templability of the UI, as well as some APIs.json support, and D3.js visualization integration--so I wil be getting more knowledgeable of the code base, and in tune with the road map. I know the LucyBot team is open sourcing the code to encourage contributions, and are looking for investment in dev and business resources to move the project forward--so get involved!
It is good to see the API definition driven API documentation conversation moving forward in 2016!

			<p><em>23 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was on the road last week, so I didn't maintain my usual barrage of API analysis. As I go through my monitoring for the week, I'd say the biggest news of the week was Apiary's support of the OpenAPI Spec. I got a test drive of the support for the API definition format over the holidays, and was impressed with how smoothly Apiary integrated the OpenAPI Spec into their API design, virtualization, and management platform.&nbsp; Another very interesting dimension of the Apiary release for me, was how they seamlessly integrated the new API definition into their road map. This wasn't a switch to the OpenAPI Spec from API Blueprint, it was about opening up, embracing, and abstracting away of multiple API definition formats across their platform operations. As an API service provider, it is just smart business to support as many possible API definition formats as you possibly can. The 2016 road map for Apiary acknowledges the value of using the OpenAPI Spec, but still reflects the strengths that API Blueprint + MSON bring to the table.&nbsp; Last September, I walked around San Francisco with Jakub Nesetril (@jakubnesetril), the CEO of Apiary, talking about the need for an open abstraction layer to help us better define our API, across all stops of the API life cycle. This wee's OpenAPI Spec support at Apiary is Jakub's vision playing out, making sure the process of defining your APIs across the design, virtualization, and management areas of your API life cycle is as robust, and agile as it possibly can be. For me, this makes this weeks news much more than about Apiary abstracting away the complexity of switching between leading API definitions, than it is about their support for the OpenAPI Spec. I had beers with Emmanuel Paraskakis(@manp) and Jakub at the Toronado on Haight Street in San Francisco this week, and had another conversation with them about their abstraction layer, which helps them efficiently switch...[<a href="/2016/01/23/the-new-api-definition-abstraction-layer-over-at-apiary/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>18 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>My API industry research is constantly moving forward, shifting, and being added to--much like the space itself. As I work to update each of my research areas each week, my process involves adding any news I've curated, and changes to the companies who are doing things in the space, as well as add or remove any common building blocks I've identified. These building blocks are the common patterns I've identified by studying how API providers are operating, and what features API service providers are bringing to the table, for API providers to put to work. This last fall, in preparation for my keynotes at Defrag and APIStrat, I pushed forward much of my research, flushing out more of the building blocks across 20+ of my research areas. As I was preparing for another big push forward with my research, I wanted to stop and take a snapshot of just what I'd consider to be the essential building blocks across the most mature areas of my API monitoring research. I track almost 1000 stops along the modern API life cycle, but this snapshot represents what I'd consider to be a master list that API providers, and service providers should be considering as they design, develop, manage, and execute on almost 20 other areas of a modern API lifecycle. This snapshot is meant to be a guide to what I'm seeing in the space, which can be used as a checklist, in your own API strategy. I do not recommend every company do every thing listed in this document, but they are elements that you should be considering, and hopefully have a better understanding of. Like my other guides, this one is in beta. I'm adding a couple new areas to my research in January that will impact this work, and I will also be exposing links to other companies, services, and resources that support each building block.

			<p><em>13 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I just finished spending an hour talking with&nbsp;Brent Baker (@norcaljhawk), head of product for Dwolla, and Jordan Lampe (@JsLampe), about the vision behind the developer experience for their new developer portal. I will be able to craft many stories from the notes I generated during our conversation, but there was one aspect of how they view consumers of their ACH transfer API, I wanted to quickly share.
This portion part of our conversation came up when they mentioned how they broke up their API users, as they were rethinking the overall developer experience. They put API consumers into four distinct categories:

seeker - individual looking for a solution
implementer - individual implementing solution
maintainer - individual maintaining solution
hacker - individual playing with their solution

I think this is a great way to look at your API consumers. I've heard many different approaches to labeling your API consumer buckets, but I'd say this is the first time that I've heard it put so elegantly. A moment I couldn't help but ruin, by selfishly adding:

analyst - individual looking to understand role solution plays in big picture

You can't forget about us analyst types who will just talk about your APIs, and rarely actually do any "real work". ;-) Anyways, I just wanted to share this small part of our conversation. The Dwolla developer portal experience is rich with API management examples, that other API providers should be looking to emulate. I will keep processing the notes from our conversation, and share any other nuggets I collected during my walk through the API journey the Dwolla team has crafted within their new&nbsp;API portal.

			<p><em>13 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>One of the benefits of doing an API, is so that you can take advantage of the potential for a community feedback loop, driven by internal groups, external partners, and even in some cases the pubic. Under my API management research, you can find a number of building blocks I recommend for helping power your feedback loop, but sometimes I like to just showcase examples of this in the wild, to show how it all can work. I was reading the&nbsp;Letter from our co-founder: 2016 Product vision, from Electronic Health Record (EHR) provider Practice Fusion, and I thought the heart of the blog post, represented a well functioning feedback loop. As Practice Fusion looked back over 2015, they noted the following activity: 798&nbsp;product ideas submitted&nbsp;with over 3,000 comments. 64&nbsp;community ideas already delivered&nbsp;as product features. 45&nbsp;new ideas currently being worked on. Acknowledging that this feedback "powers everything we do". They continue listing some of the major customer requests that were fulfilled in 2015, and close the letter with an "eye towards the future". It is a simple, but nice example of how a platform's community can drive the platform road map. Sure a lot of this comes from the SaaS side of the Practice Fusion operations, but it works in sync with the Practice Fusion developer community as well.&nbsp; The lesson from this one, to include in my overall research, is to always have a way to collect feedback from the community, tag ideas for discussion as potential additions to the road map, and carefully track on which ideas get delivered, and which ones end up being included in the road map. This is something that is pretty easy to do with Github Issue Management, which I use for my own personal projects, to drive both my road maps, and resulting change logs. This post also pushed me to begin tagging these types of stories, organizing them into a simple API playbook, full of API platform...[<a href="/2016/01/13/the-api-feedback-loop-your-feedback-powers-everything-we-do/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I was just talking API documentation with&nbsp;Brent Baker (@norcaljhawk), and Jordan Lampe (@JsLampe) from&nbsp;Dwolla. As we were going through their API documentation, they mentioned how they were using Slate for the version 1.0 of their API documentation, but for this round they took what they felt were just the best parts of Slate, and were looking to craft a new experience.&nbsp; Interestingly I had written about their use of Slate for API docs back in 2014, so it makes sense for me to keep tracking on, but more importantly I think the move reflects the wider evolution of API documentation. If you aren't familiar with Slate, it is a very attractive way to document your APIs, that many API providers and consumers have latched on to. Slate, in contrast to the very utilitarian style of Swagger UI, has certain elements developer prefer--something I can see why, after looking at a lot of API docs. Dwolla's evolution from their old static API docs to Slate, and then to their current version&nbsp;highlighted two important aspects of the modern API documentation evolution for me. First, the feedback to the Dwolla team revealed that the three column format which Slate used for documentation, made the documentation seem like it was not part of the overall Dwolla experience--it was separate. Which is one unique thing Swagger UI did, is that allowed it to be embedded within any API portal, even though the look was not as attractive as Slate is. As they evolve overall their portal experience, Dwolla was sure they wanted to keep the code sample viewer, which allows for inline viewing of raw, PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript samples for each API. In rethinking their API docs, the Dwolla team wanted to decouple the three-pane experience, but keep the attractiveness, flowing navigation, and inline language sample experience that Slate delivered--keeping just the best parts of the increasingly ubiquitous API documentation format. For me this highlights some of the...[<a href="/2016/01/13/just-the-best-parts-of-the-api-documentation-please/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I got an email in my inbox, about a new API modeling language from Elastic Path earlier today. The product is called Helix, and is sold as being "the first enterprise-class API modeling language designed specifically for REST Level 3". &nbsp; The Elastic Path team is where I first learned about the concept of hypermedia, I believe back in 2011--honestly, I had heard the concept before, but never fully grasped what it was, and the potential until 2011 (I know I am slow). However it has been an awareness that has grown rapidly, the more I learn about hypermedia, study how people are practicing hypermedia, and even dabble in it myself with my curation, and building block APIs. Elastic Path is an expert in the area of hypermedia, so it makes sense they would step up with some hypermedia focused API tooling, and even a modeling language. No surprises here, but where I was a little surprised, was when I read the "Why Helix": Elastic Path built Helix because existing API modeling languages, such as RAML, Swagger, and API Blueprint, while good for describing standard APIs, are not well suited to designing hypermedia APIs. Elastic Path Cortex, our patented API technology, utilizes Helix definitions and a Helix-compatible implementation, allowing our partners and customers to extend existing APIs and quickly create new ones. After reading, I wanted to explore the portion of their description that states, "Elastic Path Cortex, our patented API technology, utilizes Helix definitions and a Helix-compatible implementation, allowing our partners and customers to extend existing APIs and quickly create new ones.", but specifically the "patented API technology".

			<p><em>12 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>I was emailed by someone working in government, asking some pretty interesting questions around using an application showcase, to make trusted applications available to an ecosystem of partners. I'm not going to talk specifically about the agency, as I have not gotten approval to talk publicly, but I think the question is an interesting mix of several areas I am researching, that I wanted to explore a little further, in an anonymous fashion. &nbsp; This is a a heavily edited, summarized version of what was asked, but it essentially went like this: There are 400 apps that want to get data from an organization but only some portion of them meet or exceed the governance criteria to be deemed &ldquo;trustworthy&rdquo;. &nbsp;This usually involves certain legal commitments are followed and other privacy requirements are satisfied--these 400 apps that will be evaluated, and if they qualify, they will be put into the an application registry. Another aspect of it is that rather than each of the 400 apps having to go to each of the partners to get authorized and access the partners API that it would be more efficient to rely on the application registry to determine if they can expose their APIs to that apps request(s) as well. Application showcases, that share approved applications with an ecosystem is common, but what I found interesting about this agencies question is that they want to also use the application approval process, as a sign of trust for other partners, when it comes to accessing their own API resources. As I said, this conversation spans three key areas of what I'm seeing occur modern API ecosystems: 3rd Party Applications (ie. approval, showcase, case studies, etc.) Partner Programs (i.e. certification, access tiers, etc.) Service Composition (ie. plans, monetization, rate limiting, etc.) Modern approaches to API planning, and well thought-out API driven partner programs, provide the approaches you need to approve partners (ie. companies), and the applications they build.

			<p>API Evangelist has long been dedicated to helping the average business user understand all that is API. I saw early on in 2010, the potential of APIs, when used to empower the IT, or even shadow IT of the average business user. I think I've done well in this mission, except for one thing, the API Evangelist network is heavily focused on providing APIs, and much more lighter on topics and information around consuming APIs--something I will be working hard to shift over the next five years. To help me tackle this, is my new partner Cloud Elements. I do not partner with organizations, unless they help fuel my research, and Cloud Elements is helping me pushing forward several areas including API aggregation, API reciprocity, as well as pushing me to profile 50 of the top business sectors. While these areas of my research will have lots of information for API providers, many of the companies, services, and tooling I profile in these areas will be about empowering API consumers, and even more importantly--all types of API consumers, not just developers. Services like IFTTT and Zapier, make APIs accessible to the average business user because they allow them to move things around in the cloud using APIs. API service providers like Cloud Elements are allowing the average user to not just move things around in a way that protects their interest, and the interest of platforms (aka reciprocity), but they also all for aggregation, automation, and orchestration, of critical business "life bits" like documents, contacts, and images. This is why I seek out partners like them, to work in concert to better understand the space, but also tell stories that help average business user solve their actual problems. #winwin You will hear me talk a lot about what Cloud Elements is doing in 2016.

			<p>I struggle a lot with how I separate out my research areas--there are a lot of reasons why I will break off, or group information in a certain way. Really it all comes down to some layer of separation in my head, or possibly what I perceive will be in my readers head. For example, I broke off hypermedia into its own research project, but now I'm considering just weaving it into my API design research.&nbsp; This is one of the reasons I conduct my research the way I do, is that it lets me spin out research, if I feel necessary, but I can easily combine projects, when I want as well. As I move API aggregation and reciprocity out of my "trends" category, and into my primary bucket of research, I'm consideration an addition of a 3rd area dedicated to just orchestration. Right now I'm considering aggregation staying focused on providing APIs that bring together multiple APIs into a single interface, and reciprocity is about moving things between two API driven services--I'm thinking orchestration will be more about the bigger picture that will involve automation, scheduling, events, jobs, logging, and much more.&nbsp; I enjoy my research being like my APIs, and keeping them the smallest possible units as possible. When they start getting too big, I can carve off a piece into its own area. I can also easily daisy chain them together, like API design, definitions, and hypermedia are. Some companies I track on will only enable API reciprocity at the consumer level, like IFTTT, where others like Cloud Elements will live in aggregation, reciprocity, and orchestration. I also think orchestration will always deal with business or industrial grade API usage, where my individual users can look to some of the lighter weight, more focused solutions, available in reciprocity. Who knows? I might change my tune in the future, but for now I have enough curated stories, and companies who are focused...[<a href="/2016/01/12/api-aggregation-reciprocity-and-orchestration/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>09 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>I feel pretty strongly that for the next wave of growth in the API sector, we need the majority of public APIs in use today, to have well crafted, as complete as possible, API definitions in either OpenAPI Spec or API Blueprint. Yes I know, we actually need all of these APIs to be crafted using hypermedia approaches, but until then we need them all to possess machine readable API definitions, making them discoverable, learnable, and consumable. It is easy to get hung up on this being about API discovery, but API definitions are enabling almost every step along the 35 areas of the API life cycle I am mapping out. Historically API definitions have bee used for interactive API documentation, but more recently are additionally being used to light up other aspects of API integration, such as setting up your API monitoring, loading into the API client of your choosing, or lighting up a mock server for use in development.&nbsp; In addition enabling services and tooling throughout the life cycle, well crafted, complete API definitions is driving API design literacy. Many API developers and architects learn by reverse engineering the APIs they know, and a well crafted OpenAPI Spec or API Blueprint provides a detail blueprint for enabling this experience. API definitions make it easier to learn about good, and bad API design, in terms of the APIs you actually care about--equaling a much more open mind. I've been working to define API definitions as part of my API Stack work, for over a year now. You can access all the APIs.json + OpenAPI Specs + API Blueprint + Postman collections under the /data folder for the project repository. Additionally, this repo is one of the sources of APIs.io which is an APIs.json driven open source API search engine, which provides an API for you to register and search for API definitions.

			<p><em>08 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>Another story I wanted to tell from my work to expose an API yesterday, so I could get help with it, was focused around the service composition that I used. I feel like this is a powerful story, that should be told, and retold among API evangelists, across conversations with folks who are new to the API space, and the concept of putting APIs to work in their daily business worlds. The largest concern I hear from people who don't fully understand API, is the perceived loss of control, from putting things up on the open Internet. When you don't understand modern API management infrastructure, and the nuance of API service composition, what an API does can seem pretty scary. The first lesson around me exposing of an API, from the @APIStrat speaker database, was about soliciting help from Nicolas Greni&eacute; (@picsoung), and the second lesson is centered around how I used a combination of public / private endpoints to make this work. The first two endpoints or methods I published from my speaker databases, were simple GETs: http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/ http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/aO6zItrUhKEUexi7zNiUjOzzJ1230Rfno9P123DJRHNEuh4117/ All 351 speakers in our database are already public, on the schedules for each of the six @APIStrat events, so there really is no reason why I would lock up the APIs to get this information--I am just returning JSON representations, in addition to the HTML I already do on the websites. However, for the collaboration part with @picsoung the POST, PUT, DELETE (aka Add, Update, Delete), I'm going to need to secure things a little more. Using my already in place, 3Scale API management infrastructure, I have an access tier specifically for my partners like 3Scale, WSO2, and @picsoung already has a set of API keys at this API plan level. I simply put the three endpoints / methods for POST, PUT, and DELETE for the URLs above, into my "partner" level, and they require an appID and appKey for each API call--secured.

			<p><em>08 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>I see a lot of APIs, and honestly I'm not excited about all of them. Some are public. Some are private. I am feeling that I could put the APIs I see into 3 different buckets: valuable, some value, and no value. Obviously there is going to be much more nuance to it that that, but this post is about the APIs that generate no value. First, let me clarify--I am speaking value to everyone involved. This is my own personal measurement. Examples of APIs that offer no value, are usually about the exploitation of developers and/or end-users, while giving the lion share of value to the platform. I put a lot of Internet of Things APIs into this bucket, and other leading APIs from companies like Snapchat or LinkedIn. I'd also put APIs like facial recognition technology, some machine learning APIs, and APIs that may seemingly offer a lot of value to everyone involved, because of the opportunities for abuse, any value that has generated is cancelled out. I' not going to point fingers at the specific API that triggered this post. I will just say that after reviewing an API, the opportunity for abuse is pretty huge, by the platform, as well as with 3rd party developers. It reminded me that I need to work to provide more ethical best practices as part of my API design research, reminding API architects to step back early on in the process, and consider the big picture--asking themselves should we be doing building this API in the first place. We have what it takes to do almost anything we want, but I don't think we ask ourselves: "should we be doing this" enough. We aren't look at the big picture, and considering privacy, security, surveillance, and what the overall potential for abuse might be. When I am considering the potential for API abuse, I ask myself "what would Keith Casey (@CaseySoftware) be able to do?"

			<p><em>07 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>I pulled the title for this post directly from understanding the impact of cross-border routing of data during an era of emerging geographic restrictions, from Dyn. I'm writing about this to add it to my list of numerous concerns for API providers, when it comes to internationalizing their APIs, for the global API economy--such as establishing&nbsp;successful patterns for multi-lingual APIs and documentation, or providing API access that is replicated into multiple regions around the globe. Dyn's perspective comes from a more regulatory level, which I think coming from a DNS provider is something that makes the story even more compelling. At any rate, I feel with the big data / surveillance culture that is thriving right now, regulatory concerns, when it comes to data and privacy will continue to be a natural response, and will increase, and continue to be more heavy handed.&nbsp; I am not a fan of regulation, I understand its purpose, but historically I have not been an advocate for. However there has to be a counterbalance to the bad big data behavior from tech companies, surveillance by tech companies and the government, and the increasing cyberbullshittery that is going on. I'd prefer this counter-balance be a human and people driven response, but I'm guessing it will end up being a wave of very emotional government regulatory responses, like we seen with Safe Harbor, and beyond. Its my opinion that extensive logging, software defined networking, and APIs coupled with OAuth controls is how we are going to orchestrate our operations in this new, extremely volatile, land-mine ridden regulatory environment that is unfolding. This is why I keep an eye on global DNS infrastructure providers like Dyn, as part of my DNS research, so that I can map out all of their API operations, and include alongside logging, SDN, and other relevant APIs--the automation of cross-border data flows using APIs, so that you can mitigate regulatory uncertainty.

			<p><em>07 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>I have been working to clean up the the web presence for the API Strategy &amp; Practice conference. We concluded the 6th edition of @APIStrat in Austin this last november (check out the videos), and in addition to this events website, I have five other sites to maintain, and make sure remain accessible. The first three sites have a custom database back-end, the next two had a WordPress + MySQL back-end, and the last edition uses Jekyll + YAML as its back-end(?).&nbsp; As part of this round of housecleaning I aggregated the schedule of speakers from all six events into a single spreadsheet, which ended up on my desktop as a CSV file. As I was talking this morning with the rest of the @APIStrat team about the 2016 schedule, I shared the CSV in Slack, as I also uploaded to a MySQL database (yeah I'm new / old school like that). I was talking with my partner in crime Nicolas Greni&eacute; (@picsoung) shortly after, and he wanted to help me push forward the list of speakers, expand the speaker and company info, as well as connect it up with sponsor info. I then responded, as Steve Willmott (@njyx) points out on Twitter (is nothing private these days!!!): APIer's at work @kinlane "I may take you up on that sir. loaded into DB. Let me expose an API on it I&rsquo;ll ping you for some help" @picsoung &mdash; Steven Willmott (@njyx) January 7, 2016 I went ahead and exposed an API of all of the 351 speakers who have participated in @APIStrat since the first edition in New York in February 2013--you can access the endpoints, publicly at: http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/ I also added the ability to pull a single speaker as well: http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/aO6zItrUhKEUexi7zNiUjOzzJ1230Rfno9P123DJRHNEuh4117/ All you have to do is put in the speaker_id for each of the speakers.

			<p><em>06 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>
I came across the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, while conducting a search that turned up the chronology of data breaches, which provides details on&nbsp;4,725 data breaches that have been made public since 2005. The website allows you to search for data breaches by type of breach, type of organization, and the year in which it occurred--some very valuable information.
In 2016, as breaches continue to be common place across almost all industries, we are going to need to take the chronology of data breaches up a notch. I would like to see an API be made available for the valuable database. As I do, I write stories about what I'd like to see in the space, and forward the link to key actors, and tell the story to the public at large, in hopes of inciting something to happen.
Making the data breach information available via API, would encourage more storytelling around the events, which could include much more meaningful visualizations using solutions like D3.js. Information about companies, could be included into other business search and discovery tooling, and more push notification networks could be setup that could keep industry experts more informed about what is happening across the sector.
Now that I am on the subject, it would make sense if all the privacy topics, and other resources available via the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse accessible through a simple API interface. If you work with the&nbsp;Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, and would like to talk about making this happen, feel free to reach out. If you are someone who would like to help work on this project, or possibly fund this work, also please let me know.
The type of information the&nbsp;Privacy Rights Clearinghouse is aggregating is only going to become more important in the insecure cyber world we have created, and making it accessible for reading and writing via a simple API, would significantly help the organization make a bigger impact, and educate a larger audiences.

			<p><em>05 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>I am finding all sorts of interesting examples as I push forward my API plans research, where I study the API planning approaches employed by over 50 of the leading APIs. One of the items, on my API plan story list, comes from Algolia, the search API, who I think has one of the more sophisticated API plans of all of the APIs I looked at this round.&nbsp; One of the cool aspects I found was a "world-wide replicator" option on the pricing page for Algolia. The feature is interesting to me because of the UX / UI approach employed, as well as the concept of offering API replication to different regions as a dimension of API plans. You have to admit the separate section, as part of API pricing, is pretty forward leaning, and not something you see often. What is even cooler, is that when you move the slider, increasing the number of regions the API is available in, your price per package is adjusted to include the replication. I believe they apply just a flat rate increase for each plan level, but I could see this be something that has unique cost per region (ie. US being more expensive than EU). As the debate about in-country data storage and compute evolves, I think this will become pretty significant. The goal for the Algolia world-wide replication, is to decrease latency for end-users, when searches are made. Providing up to five separate regions around the globe, where your API can be deployed, as part of your Algolia API plan. While not something that could be accomplished by every API, the approach is in alignment with wholesale API movements I've talked about before. Using API infrastructure like 3Scale offers, you could establish this type of variability in plan levels, that are tailored for containerized-enabled, world-wide replication similar to what Algolia offers. I have added world-wide or regional replication as one of the API plan building...[<a href="/2016/01/05/your-api-access-replicated-into-multiple-regions-around-the-globe-for-additional-charge/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>05 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>As I look through the business models of leading API providers I am profiling, I'm increasingly seeing security as a selling point. When API providers break down their pricing into tiers, they are usually very good at breakdown down the elements of what goes into each plan--this is what I have been studying for last couple weeks.&nbsp; When I come across security leveraged as part of API plans, it is rarely a part of the free or entry levels, and is something you usually see in the higher level paid plans, and enterprise tiers. Here is an example of this, in a screen shot from the Box pricing page. These plans are part of the SaaS side of the Box operations, but Box are pretty unique in that they have separate pricing tiers for the SaaS side of their operations, and a related, but addition set of pricing for the API side of their platforms. However, Box's approach provide the best example of this in action, with add-ons beyond the plan based pricing, that were also very security focused. Box is a document platform that services the enterprise, which includes numerous, very heavily regulated industries. It makes sense that they are emphasizing security. My focus is that security is leveraged as specific feature of individual plans, with an emphasis on it being present in the upper tiers, and with add-ons. This really isn't news. It makes sense that an emotionally charged element like security is used as a component of planning and pricing. I'm just looking to document security as a component of API planning for my research, educate other platforms about the potential for this type of use, but I am also looking to better understand how different companies, in different industries are wielding it (or not). I predict that security will increasingly be used as a component like this in SaaS and API planning.
