I wrote about <a href="https://apimatic.io/">Apimatic</a> a few months back and how they are focused on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/07/evolving-how-we-approach-the-api-lifecycle-with-apimatic/">generating high quality SDKs</a> from machine readable API formats like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>.</p>
<p>This last week I was introduced to another provider, <a href="https://magnet.com/">Magnet</a>, and their <a href="https://developer.magnet.com/">rest2mobile service</a> which will &ldquo;generate mobile native code for REST services&rdquo;.  Magnet has chosen to focus exclusively on mobile SDKs, where Apimatic is focused on web and mobile SDKs. I consider web SDKs one building block, and mobile SDKs another building block, and companies should evaluate their need for them side-by-side, something service providers like <a href="https://apimatic.io/">Apimatic</a> and <a href="https://magnet.com/">Magnet</a> are looking to assist with.</p>
<p>As the API universe continues its expansion we will see more API services like these emerge who are focused on helping API providers better deliver the building blocks of their API platforms. I will keep tracking on the common building blocks of API design, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a> and <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>, and continue to showcase interesting companies stepping up to provide services that deliver the valuable building blocks the space needs to operate.</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)
