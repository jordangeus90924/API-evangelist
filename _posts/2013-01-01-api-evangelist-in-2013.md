{% include JB/setup %}<p>After looking back at 2012, I wanted a January 1, 2013 blog post for my blogs.My first blog post of 2012 was my tour schedule for January, 2012.While it was a pretty busy time for evangelizing and hackathons, I wanted something a little deeper.I’m not sure what, but I will play with the format year to year, until I find what I’m looking for.Every year I rewrite my bio, based upon where I am in my life.</p>
