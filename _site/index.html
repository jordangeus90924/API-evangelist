		<p>API Evangelist is about making sense of the world of application programming interfaces, or simple APIs. APIs have become part of every layer of our Internet connected world over the last 20 years, and this is my research project into understanding what is happening. As of 2019 I am also the Chief Evangelist for Postman, but I still use this site in the same way I have since 2010, as a workbench for what I am working on each day. Providing me with a very public way to work through my projects, while helping others see the world of APIs in different ways, and hopefully learn more about how APIs are being applied across our world</p>
		<p>This isn't meant to be a blog in the traditional sense of the word, and you should think of it as Kin Lane's personal notebook that he is fine with others reading. Once you spend time reading my work you will better understand that this is my souning board, helping me work through my ideas, and I am not doing this for page views, audience size, or other metric. However, after over ten years of doing this I tend to have a regular group of folks who are tuning in and providing commentary via Twitter, GitHub, and other channels.</p>

				<p><em>30 Jan 2021</em></p>
				<p>I have to admit something. I don&rsquo;t fully grasp the entire landscape of API testing. I mean, I have a pretty decent awareness and experience in testing APIs, but I can&rsquo;t close my eyes and coherently break down each layer or type of testing, let alone competently navigate the many different types of services and tooling available on the market for API testing. Like most other dimensions of the API universe the content and guidance on the subject of API testing is all over the place. After a couple of hours Googling and making my way through my bookmarks, I uncovered a pretty expansive dictionary for what I&rsquo;d consider to be under the umbrella of API testing. First off, I have to talk about API testing in the most general sense before I get into the more and less formal API testing approaches. It was a dimension of API testing I hadn&rsquo;t considered before I began working at Postman, but API testing meaning that I am just kicking the tires on a API, learning what it is all about, and how you use it. This is what the majority of Postman&rsquo;s 13 million users are doing when they say they are testing an API with the Postman platform. THis experimental and curious approach to API testing provides a great onramp to the world of API publishing and consumption, but does little to help us articulate what API testing is or isn&rsquo;t. Beyond just &ldquo;testing out&rdquo; an API, from what I can gather across about 25 separate API testing articles, there are 25 different layers to the API testing onion: Validation Testing - I am guessing a general type of validation &mdash; seems pretty broad. Functional Testing - Adopted as part of code testing practices, applied to unit of code. Component Testing - Similar to functional, but testing based upon small unit of compute. User Interface Testing - Testing of the API in the context of...[<a href="/2021/01/30/making-sense-of-the-different-types-of-api-testing/">Read More</a>]</p>

				<p><em>30 Jan 2021</em></p>
				<p>I love the word entropy. It means so many things to so many different people. In means different things in the physical realm versus the informational or virtual realms. It is one of those big words you can say to confuse people, or actually get yourself in trouble being able to actually defend your position on what entropy means when around smart people. It is said that famed mathematician John Von Neumann had told fellow mathematician and creator of Information Theory that he should use the word entropy instead of information because that no one understands entropy and then you can win arguments about your theory. I also read that Shannon and Norbert Weiner also dueled over the meaning, seeing it in very opposite ways. I like the word for all of these reasons, but mostly because of its relationship to uncertainty.&nbsp; In the realm of physics entropy means, a thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of disorder or randomness in the system In the more virtual realm of information theory, the entropy of a random variable is the average level of information, surprise, or uncertainty inherent in the variable's possible outcomes. While I could easily use entropy as a metaphor for APIs in the physical sense, it is really the appropriation of it for information theory that really brings it home for me. Entropy in Shannon&rsquo;s time was centered around noise or static in communication, but when you look at how APIs enable communication between systems, and allowing web, mobile, device, and network applications to communicate, this static or noise reveals itself as friction, errors, outages, instability, unreliability, and misaligned business and political priorities.&nbsp; &nbsp;Think about the level of information one encounters when it comes to putting APIs to work these days. Consider the surprise one encounters when seemingly similar API resources speak entirely different dialects or behave inconsistently.

				<p><em>29 Jan 2021</em></p>
				<p>I am preparing for the next version of APIs.json and I am taking another pass over what the specification is, but also taking a fresh look at why the specification exists. Part of this fresh look involves assessing what I consider to be the low bar for an APIs.json index, as well as what the entire scope might look like. To help me (and you) understand the scope of what APIs.json or APIs.yaml can do when it comes to indexing our API operations and making them discoverable in a machine readable way. The most important thing to remember about APIs.json is that it is all about indexing API operations in a way that acknowledges that there are two sides of this API integration game which need to be indexed and made discoverable across an organization. Human Readable - Providing URL references for the aspects of API Operations that human stakeholders will need to understand what is happening with APIs and how to put them to work in applications. Machine Readable - Providing URL references for aspects of API Operations that are system and applications can use to make sense of API Operations, accessing as a machine readable definition. APIs.json is about indexing all of these human and machine readable aspects of our API Operations with an emphasis on evolving human readable elements to also be machine readable so that as much of the surface area of our API operations is indexable by other systems and applications as possible. There is another dimension of APIs.json as a specification that is helpful to understand beyond the human and machine readable elements, by providing a vocabulary for describing two separate scopes of API operations, helping define the scope of information provided. API Specific Properties - References to details about a specific API, providing human and machine readable details about an API, so that consumers understand everything that is possible. Common Properties - References to details that support all...[<a href="/2021/01/29/examples-of-minimum-viable-and-complete-landscape-apis-json-index-files/">Read More</a>]</p>

				<p><em>23 Jan 2021</em></p>
				<p>I am giving some much needed love to my APIs.yaml and API.json API discovery format while using the work to also just think about the wider API landscape. This is the original intent behind APIs.json&hellip;to help me make sense of the API landscape.&nbsp; Most folks are thinking about APIs as a producer, or as a consumer&mdash;hopefully both. However, there are fewer people who also pay attention to the entire API landscape, and APIs.json emerged out of this need for me in 2014. In 2020 I find myself totally immersed in the API landscape as part of my API Specification Toolbox project which grew out of Postman becoming a member of the OpenAPI Initiative, and I wanted toht spend why Saturday afternoon (I know I have a problem) thinking about the API landscape at the 250K.&nbsp; APIs.json API Property Types Using APIs.json or APIs.yaml you can define the properties of one or many APIs for a variety of purposes. Each API you describe can have an array of properties which can be common human readable elements like documentation or sign up, as well as machine readable properties like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, or JSON Schema. APIs.json property types are intentionally human or machine readable with the intent on evolving every human readable element to have a machine readable element&mdash;think the relationship between documentation (Human) and OpenAPI (Machine) when understand the objective. I have several thousand API Providers and API service providers in my API Evangelist database. I track on the properties of all of these companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies that I come across. When I group the property types across the thousands of APIs I have indexed, I end up with this default set of building blocks for API providers, grouped by different areas of the API lifecycle. Onboarding These are the properties of any API operation that help consumers, or any other party onboard with the concept of an API, begin using the API, as...[<a href="/2021/01/23/evaluating-apis-json-api-property-types-alongside-openapi-extensions/">Read More</a>]</p>

				<p><em>11 Jan 2021</em></p>
				<p>The word &ldquo;open&rdquo; gets thrown around so much in the API space I find myself needing to regularly ground myself in what it actually means. It gets thrown around in so many different ways that I find eventually I start to believe the bullshit and regularly have to pause and recalibrate. It is one of those words that has been captured and used by people looking to manipulate the space so often it often means the exact opposite of what we all think it means, but it is also such an important word that I think we have to fight to keep it in our vocabulary. I feel like I am perpetually fighting with some invisible force over one of the front doors to the house we all live in, and I am determined for the door to not get completely shut, and I have to make sure the door actually ends up go where someone expects when they do open the door. Let&rsquo;s begin by actually taking inventory regarding the many different ways people use the word &ldquo;open&rdquo; to describe the world of APIs. Gathering all the ways it gets wielded in service of publishing and consuming APIs. Some of the ways in which it gets wielded are good, and some of them are bad. At this point I am just looking to be able to see the spectrum of use, and I am not looking to entirely pass judgement on anyone who uses it in specific ways. Here is the laundry list of ways &ldquo;open&rdquo; is wielded that impact the landscape I pay attention to on a daily basis, and have been helping shape for the last decade.&nbsp; &nbsp;Publicly Available - Open means something is available to anyone in the public, allowing them to use an API, and any resources around them. &nbsp;Access - An API or supporting resource is open for access by the public or the developer community in general, making...[<a href="/2021/01/11/what-does-open-mean-in-the-world-of-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

				<p><em>27 Dec 2020</em></p>
				<p>It has been a while since I looked at the 250K view of what is going on with APIs across federal government agencies in the United States. Since working for the Obama administration in 2013 I am perpetually on a quest to map out what is happening across federal agencies, helping drive the conversation forward. I belieive APIs can make the most impact when our federal government helps lead the way, and I am looking to help push things forward in the following ways. Keep mapping out the Federal Government API Landscape - I am determined to produce a map of the APIs that exist across federal agencies and keep the list alive and active. Establish Public API Workspaces for Federal Agencies - I am looking to establish public API workspaces for agencies who are implementing APIs--helping do some work from the outside-in. Refresh My Memory of What is Happening - I thrive on knowing what is going on across federal agencies, and doing these reviews pushes me to refresh my awarenss of APIs at this level. Fire Up new Conversations - These sotries always rise up in the SEO game and bring in new conversations with folks who are doing interesting things with APIs in government. I always learn a lot looking through the different government agencies. I learn even more wading through the different datasets, databases, and various incarnations of APIs. There is way too much work here than one person can handle, and much of what I come across labeled as an API really isn't an API, but could be with a little work. While doing these roundups I always reach a point where I feel like I am not doing enough, but ultimately I have to strike a balance between being comprehensive and just scratching the surface. Providing just enough information to allow me to plant seeds that might grow into new conversations down the road, while not spend all of...[<a href="/2020/12/27/taking-a-fresh-look-at-apis-across-all-the-united-states-federal-agencies/">Read More</a>]</p>

				<h3><a href="/2020/12/17/a-postman-collection-for-capitalizing-folders-requests-in-collections/">A Postman Collection For Capitalizing Folders & Requests In Collections</a></h3>
				<p><em>17 Dec 2020</em></p>
				<p>Sometimes I need to do bulk updates to Postman collections and there is no better way to automate this than to use a Postman Collection that uses the Postman API&mdash;inception level stuff, so be careful ;-). I have setup a dedicated public workspace where I am building out these utility type operational level collections&nbsp;that help me manage the API lifecycle out ahead of what the Postman GUI is capable of doing. Some of the things I am doing will eventually make its way to the Postman UI, but some of them will not. Either way, I am too impatient to wait, and one of the things I love about Postman is that I can hack my way forward through just about any situation using the Postman API. Building on my base collection for pulling and updating collections, I added two differents requests that will help me capitalize the first letter of each word in a folder or request name of a collection. Apply Title Case to All Folder Names in a Collection Apply Title Case to All Request Names in a Collection To run, all you have to do is make sure you&rsquo;ve entered a collection ID (pulled from URL or info tab), and hit run&mdash;it will loop through each folder and request and capitalize the words, and then save the collection using the Postman API. So you can immediately put to use the same collection with the changes you desired. If you have any questions on the collection for pulling a collection and making changes using the Postman API, feel free to submit a comment for the collection as part of the collection workspace. I&rsquo;ll be centralizing the evolution of this collection, as well as other collection related collections within this workspace. You can also fork the collection and use in your workspaces, and submit back any enhancements you&rsquo;d like to see as a pull request. If you have any questions that you don&rsquo;t...[<a href="/2020/12/17/a-postman-collection-for-capitalizing-folders-requests-in-collections/">Read More</a>]</p>
