<p>I am working through a project for a client, helping them deliver a portal for their API. As I do with any of my recommendations with my clients, I take my existing API research, and refine it to help craft a strategy to meets their specific needs. Each time I do this it gives me a chance to rethink some of my recommendations I’ve already gathered, as well as learn from new types of projects. I’ve taken the building blocks from my <a href="http://portal.apievangelist.com">API portal</a>, as well as my <a href="http://portal.apievangelist.com">API management</a> research, and have taken a crack at organizing them into an outline that I can use to guide my current project.

<p>Here is a walk through of the outline I’m recommending as part of a basic API portal implementation, to support a simple public API:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Overview</strong> - / - Everything starts with a landing page, with a simple overview of what an API does.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then you need some basics to help make on-boarding as frictionless as possible, providing everything an API consumer needs to get going:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Getting Started</strong> - /getting-started/ - Handful of steps with exactly what is needed to get started.</li>
  <li><strong>Authentication</strong> - /authentication/ - An overview of what type of authentication is used.</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation</strong> - /documentation/ - Documentation for the APIs that are available.</li>
  <li><strong>FAQ</strong> - /faq/ - Answer the most common questions.</li>
  <li><strong>Code</strong> - /code/ - Provide code samples, libraries, and SDKs to get going.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then get API consumers signed up, or able to login and get at their API keys as quickly as you possibly can:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sign Up</strong> - /developer/ - Provide a simple sign up for a developer account.</li>
  <li><strong>Login</strong> - /developer/ - Allow users to quickly log back in after they have account.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, provide a wealth of communication and support mechanisms, helping make sure developers are aware of what is going on:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blog</strong> - /blog/ - A simple blog dedicated to sharing stories about the API.</li>
  <li><strong>Support</strong> - /support/ - Offer up a handful of support channels like email and tickets.</li>
  <li><strong>Road Map</strong> - /road-map/ - Provide a road map of what the future will hold for the API.</li>
  <li><strong>Issues</strong> - /issues/ - Share what the known issues are for the API platform.</li>
  <li><strong>Change Log</strong> - /change-log/ - Publish a log of everything that has changed with the platform.</li>
  <li><strong>Status</strong> - /status/ - Provide a status page showing the availability of API services.</li>
  <li><strong>Security</strong> - /security/ - Publish an overview of what security practices are in place.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure your consumers know how to get involved at the right level, making plans, pricing, and partnership opportunities easy to find:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Plans</strong> - /plans/ - Offer a single page with API access plans and pricing information.</li>
  <li><strong>Partners</strong> - /partners/ - Share what the partnership opportunities are, as well as existing partners.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then let’s take care of the legal side of things, making sure API consumers are fully aware of the TOS, and other aspects of operations:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Terms of Service</strong> - /terms-of-service/ - Make the terms of service easy to find.</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy</strong> - /Privacy/ - Publish a privacy statement for all API consumers.</li>
  <li><strong>Licensing</strong> - /Licensing/ - Share the licensing for API, code, data, and other assets.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also wanted to make sure I took care of the basics for the developer accounts, flushing out the common building blocks developers will need to be successful:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dashboard</strong> - /developer/dashboard/ - Provide a simple, comprehensive dashboard for developers.</li>
  <li><strong>Account</strong> - /developer/account/ - Allow API consumers to change their account information.</li>
  <li><strong>Applications</strong> - /developer/applications/ - Allow API consumers to add multiple applications, and receive API keys for each application.</li>
  <li><strong>Plans</strong> - /developer/plans/ - If there are multiple plans, allow developers to change plans.</li>
  <li><strong>Usage</strong> - /developer/usage/ - Show history of all API usage for API consumers.</li>
  <li><strong>Billing</strong> - /developer/billing/ - Allow API consumers to add, update, and remove billing information.</li>
  <li><strong>Invoices</strong> - /developer/invoices/ - Share a listing, as well as detail of all invoices for use.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then I had a handful of other looser items that I wanted to make sure were here. Some of these will be for the second phase of developoment, but I want to make sure is on the list:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Branding</strong> - /branding/ - Providing a logo, branding guidelines, and requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Embeddable</strong> - /embeddable/ - Share a handful of butts and widgets for use by consumers.</li>
  <li><strong>Webhooks</strong> - /Webhooks/ - Publish details on how to setup and manage webhook notifications.</li>
  <li><strong>iPaaS</strong> - /ipaas/ - Information on Zapier, and other iPaaS integration solutions that are available.</li>
  <li><strong>Spreadsheets</strong> - /spreadsheets/ - Share any spreadsheet plugins or connectors that are available for integration.</li>
</ul>

<p>That concludes what I’d consider to be the essential building blocks for an API. Sure, there are some more minor APIs that can operate on a bare bones version of this list, but for any API looking to conduct business at scale, I’d recommend considering everything on this list. It reflects what I find across the leading providers like Stripe and Twilio, and reflect what I like to see from an API provider when I am getting up and running using any API.

<p>I have Jekyll templates for each of these building blocks, which use the Bootstrap UI for the layout. I am updating it for this project, then I will publish again as a set of forkable tools that anyone can implement. I’m going to publish a new API portal that runs as an interactive outline of essential building blocks, then creates new Github repository for a user, and publishes each of the selected components to the repo. Providing a buffet of API developer portal tools anyone can put to work for their API without much work.
