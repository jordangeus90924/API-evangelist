{% include JB/setup %}<p>One of the ways I develop content for this site is by talking through my day to day experiences as an API Evangelist.I feel that talking through what Iâ€™m learning in real-time, is the best way to make it stick, while also sharing with the public.There is a lot of value that comes out of my daily learning, and it would be wrong to not share this.I had someone approach me on LinkedIn today and ask: Im trying to convince my colleagues and managers on the importance of having internal API, not just as a prologue to public API, but also as a way to have cleaner, better-understood interfaces internally for our developers.Do you have any thoughts or tips on the subject?</p>
