{% include JB/setup %}<p>Photo Credits I took a walk through what I am calling the locations and places API landscape today.Most of these APIs I’m familiar with, but as the CityGrid API Evangelist, I’m getting an opportunity to immerse myself into this new local, social mobile world.As I immerse myself in this semi-new world I want to share my findings with everyone else. If you have any suggestions make sure and let me know in comments below.First I started with CityGrid APIs, which provide several key location and places APIs: The Places API - Provides functionality for information on local businesses, including search, detail, user content submission, and predictive text The Offers API - Provides coupons and special offers from businesses based on geography and category The Reviews API - Provides access to customer reviews for businesses selected by id or by geography or category Then I wanted to see what Google was doing, and of course started with the Google Maps APIs: Maps JavaScript API - The Google Maps Javascript API lets you embed Google Maps in your own web pages Maps Image API - The Google Maps Image APIs make it easy to embed a static Google Maps image or Street View panorama into your web page, with no need for JavaScript Along with Google Maps they offer a set of Geo Web Services that contain several location and places based APIs: Directions API - The Google Directions API is a service that calculates directions between locations Distance Matrix API - The Google Distance Matrix API is a service that provides travel distance and time for a matrix of origins and destinations.</p>
