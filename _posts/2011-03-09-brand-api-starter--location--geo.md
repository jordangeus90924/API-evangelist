He's right. The pace of[API development skyrocketed in 2010][4], and will continue in 2011.

Brands that don't have an API will be left behind.

I suggested companies get their feet wet in the API space by starting with a basic [RESTful][5] API that servers up data about their products. Then once a company is confident in supporting their API they can consider delivering more supporting product information.

Whats a good next move? Location and Geographic Data. Where can your products be found? Retail and Wholesale. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/SimpleGeo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /> Provide quality, up to date information about who sells your products. Provide as much detail as you can, names, addresses, specific products and even geographic coordinates.

There are plenty of [geo and mapping API][6] resources to provide additional data that enriches your retail and wholesale store information.

Providing rich, real-time location data about products, retails, wholesalers, and partners through an API will enable web and mobile developers to build applications around your company and its products.
