        <span class="post-date">25 May 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/Facebook-Games.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />Tomorrow I'm participating in a session at <a title="Gluecon called Finishing School for Potential API Providers" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/?page_id=16">Gluecon called Finishing School for Potential API Providers</a>.
<p></p><a title="Justin Tormey" href="http://twitter.com/#!/justintormey">Justin Tormey</a> of Alcatel-Lucent will be talking some about segmentation of API developers to focus on the different types personalities wtihin an API ecosystem.
<p></p>Focusing outside of Gluecon for a moment, Facebook has been doing a good job of this type of platform segmentation. Yesterday they launched <a title="facebook + Games" href="http://www.facebook.com/fbandgames">Facebook + Games</a>, a page created for the the Facebook games partner and business community. The Facebook Page will focus on social gaming innovation, directly from the Facebook Games Partnerships Team.
<p></p>I wrote about the the <a title="Journalist on Facebook" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/17/beyond-partners-and-developers-with-your-api/">Journalist on Facebook</a> page last month, and how Facebook is targeting media and journalist with a similar Facebook Partner Platform page. This was another example of their API platform segmentation.
<p></p>This type of segmentation is key to success within a growing developer ecosystem, not all developers are created equal. Make sure you identify the differences within your community, and provide resources targeted to these gorups.

        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/gluecon.jpg" alt="" align="right" />I'm preparing for another talk tomorrow at the <a title="Glue Conference" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/">Glue conference</a> in Colorado. Glue is a conference that assists architects, developers, administrators and integrators in solving problems around web application integration.
<p></p>Glue is about all of bits and pieces, APIs and meta-data, standards and connectors that will help us to glue together the varying applications of the new platform.
<p></p>I'm on a panel at Glue called, <a title="Whats Next for APIs" href="http://gluecon.com/2011/?page_id=16">Whats Next for APIs</a>?. I'm stoked to be invited along with some major players in the API space:

        <span class="post-date">24 May 2011</span>
        <a title="Querly's aggregation of social media profiles" href="http://qwerly.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Qwerly-A-Data-API-for-the-Social-Web.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>The modern Web API got its start in CRM with <a title="Salesforce" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">Salesforce</a>, and in E-commerce with <a title="Ebay" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">Ebay</a> and <a title="Amazon" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a>, but it really found traction with social platforms like <a title="Flickr" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/02/09/history-of-apis-flickr-api/">Flickr</a>, <a title="Twitter" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-twitter/">Twitter</a>, and <a title="Facebook" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-facebook-development-platform/">Facebook</a>.
<p></p>If we want a glimpse of whats next for APIs we need to look at the areas where web APIs have been applied for the longest. We need to look at examples like<a title="Amazon's integration of their affiliate program with their Product API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/06/amazon-affiliate-is-integrated-with-product-api/">Amazon's integration of their affiliate program with their Product API</a>, and <a title="Querly's aggregation of social media profiles" href="http://qwerly.com/">Qwerly's aggregation of social media profiles</a> into a single API.
<p></p>The social space is an area where the future of APIs is being played out right now. Since the social arena has reached a critical mass in the number of platforms, users, mobile apps, and available Web APIs, the sector has matured beyond other industries, and offers great insight into what the future holds.
<p></p>I've talked about <a title="unified APIs that allow you to work with multiple APIs through a single interface" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/02/unified-apis-or-api-standards-the-race-is-on/">unified APIs that allow you to work with multiple APIs through a single interface</a>, and the <a title="potential of API discovery services for industry or common API areas" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/discovery-services-for-common-apis/">potential of API discovery services for industry or common API areas</a>, but Qwerly's approach offers another view.
<p></p><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/qwerly.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /><a title="Qwerly" href="http://qwerly.com/">Qwerly</a> aggregates social profiles across many networks into a single dead-simple data API for the social web.
<p></p>With Qwerly you can get data about a user by querying the API with an email address or a social identifier, like a Twitter handle, a Facebook username or a Facebook ID, and the Qwerly API returns:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>the person's name
     </li>
     <li>their location
     </li>
     <li>a short description, like a Twitter bio
     </li>
     <li>their social networking profiles and usernames across the web, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social networks
     </li>
     <li>a score of their online influence among their peers, like <a title="Kout" href="http://beta.klout.com/home">Klout</a>
     </li>
</ul>Qwerly API responses are delivered in JSON, and you only pay for what you use. The API combines information from web crawling, public web directories, other APIs with powerful heuristics and spam-detection algorithms, delivering high quality results.
<p></p>Other industries and sectors can benefit from such data and service discovery APIs, deployed in a RESTful way, using a pay for what you use API pricing model.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/open-source-api-billing-and-traffic-control/">Open Source API Billing and Traffic Control</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">21 May 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Console-1.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />I was writing a story for <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> tonight on the enhancements Google made recently to its API console.<p></p>
I hadn't properly covered the <a title="API Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/">API Console</a>, <a title="API Explorer" href="http://code.google.com/apis/explorer/">API Explorer</a> here on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, so I took the time, played with more, and wrote up overviews for each.<p></p>
I noticed something while reviewing Google's recent efforts to organize their family of <a title="88 APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?company=Google">88 APIs</a>, and make it easier to discover, integrate, and manage for developers.<p></p>
Google is taking a similar approach to managing their APIs, as <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, and <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3Scale.net">3Scale</a> does for other API providers.<p></p>
<a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/mashery-api-services/">Mashery</a>, and <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/3scale-api-services/">3Scale</a> provide a wealth of knowledge when it comes to API deployment that very few companies can touch.<p></p>
Beyond expertise, they provide a set of <a title="common building blocks every API should offer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks every API should offer</a>.  These are tools like forums and blogs you can find elsewhere, but these API service providers deliver in a neat bundle ready to go for your API.<p></p>
But the real value they bring to the table, that you can't really find anywhere else is:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>API Billing</li>
	<li>API Traffic Controls</li>
	<li>API Metrics &amp; Analytics</li>
</ul>
And Apigee has one other piece that Mashery and 3Scale do not.  They have an <a title="API Explorer" href="http://apigee.com/about/products_togo.html">API Explorer</a>.<p></p>
<a title="Google provides an API explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">Google provides an API Explorer</a>, and they have open sourced the code, and <a title="made it available at Google Code" href="http://code.google.com/p/google-apis-explorer/">made it available at Google Code</a>.<p></p>
Next the <a title="Google API Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google API Console</a> delivers billing and traffic controls, if this set of tools were made open source, this would be huge for the API community.<p></p>
I've been a big proponent of the need for <a title="open source building blocks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/04/open-building-blocks-for-an-api/">open source API building blocks</a>.  I say this not to devalue what Apigee, Mashery, and 3Scale bring to the table.  Their stuff rocks.  However there are many other API owners out there who aren't ready for a service like theirs, or can't afford, and a set of open source building blocks is needed.<p></p>
That leaves metrics and analytics.  I think an open source set of API analytics would be the biggest benefit to the industry.   Some APIs don't need billing tools, but everyone needs to measure and control traffic.    I have talked about the need for an <a title="open source set of aPI metrics and analytics" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/31/api-metrics-and-analytics/">open source set of API metrics and analytics</a> before.<p></p>
So I guess I'm saying to Google, Please open source your API Console, like you did the API explorer.  It will benefit the community a great deal, we will deal with API analytics next.

        <span class="post-date">21 May 2011</span>
        The <a title="Google APIs Explorer" href="http://code.google.com/apis/explorer/" target="_blank">Google APIs Explorer</a> is is a tool that helps you explore various <a title="Google APIs" href="http://code.google.com/more/" target="_blank">Google APIs</a> in a web interface without writing any code.<p></p>
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Explorer.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Google APIs Explorer allows you to:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Browse quickly through available APIs and versions</li>
	<li>See methods available for each API and available parameters</li>
	<li>Execute API requests for any method and see actual responses in real time.</li>
	<li>Make pubic or authenticated API calls</li>
</ul>
The GoogleAPIs Explorer currently supports only JSON for responses and request payloads, even though some APIs support other data formats like XML and AtomPub.<p></p>
The Google APIsExplorer provides an quick access tool for developers to discover what APIs Google offers, and enables users to immediately start using.<p></p>
This type of discovery and instant visualization can be the difference between API adoption or choosing to go with an alternative.<p></p>
Google APIs Explorer supports the following APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Google Buzz API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/buzz/" target="_blank">Buzz</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google Custom Search API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/customsearch/" target="_blank">Custom Search</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google Diacritize API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/language/diacritize/overview.html" target="_blank">Diacritize</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google Moderator API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/moderator/" target="_blank">Moderator</a></li>
	<li><a title="Google Search API for Shopping" href="http://code.google.com/apis/shopping/search/" target="_blank">Search API for Shopping</a></li>

        <span class="post-date">21 May 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-apis-discovery-filing-cabinet.png" alt="" align="right" />The<a title="Google APIs Discovery Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/index.html">Google APIs Discovery Service</a> provides a set of web APIs for discovering metadata across Google APIs.<p></p>
The discovery service delivers a JSON-based API that provides a directory of supported Google APIs, and a machine-readable discovery document"for each of the supported APIs that includes:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>List of API resource schemas based on JSON Schema</li>
	<li>List of API methods and available parameters for each method</li>
	<li>Available OAuth 2.0 scopes for each API</li>
	<li>Inline documentation of methods, parameters and available parameter values</li>
</ul>
Developers can use the Google APIs Discovery Service to build client libraries, IDE plugins and other tools that interact with supported Google APIs.<p></p>
The Google APIs Discovery Service delivers two things for each supported API:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>APIs Directory Resource</strong>
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Identification and description information, including name, version, title, and description.</li>
	<li>Documentation information, including icons and a documentation link.</li>
	<li>Status information, including status labels, and an indication as to whether or not this is the preferred version of the API.</li>
	<li>Discovery document link, the URI of the discovery document for this API</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Discovery Document Resource</strong>
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Schemas, which is a list of API resource schemas that describe the data you have access to in each API</li>
	<li>Methods, including a list of API methods and available parameters for each method.</li>
	<li>OAuth scopes, which identifies the list of OAuth scopes available for this API.</li>
	<li>Inline documentation, which provides brief descriptions of schemas, methods, parameters and available parameter values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
The Google APIs Discovery Service is part of a larger effort by Google to get a handle on their growing number of APIs.  Developers find themselves potentially using multiple Google APIs across many application or client projects.<p></p>
The Google APIs Discovery Service allows developers to find new APIs available in the directory and programmatically discover how the API authenticates, what methods, and parameters are available.<p></p>
Not many companies have the number of APIs that Google has, and would need an API discovery service.  But with the recent growth in web APIs there will be more of a need for API discovery services within specific areas or industries.

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google_apis_box_sdk.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />The <a title="Google APIs Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/#project:111046942866">Google APIs Console</a> is an interface for developers to manage and view traffic data, authentication, and billing information for up to 15 Google APIs, and more coming soon.<p></p>
Developers can bundle a collection of APIs into a project, and manage the following project information:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Activated APIs</strong> - APIs can be activated to enable traffic monitoring, filtering, and billing, and API-specific project pages.</li>
	<li><strong>Traffic information </strong>- Console reports show traffic information for each activated API, and allow for capping or filtering of usage for each API.</li>
	<li><strong>Billing information </strong>- APIs now can have billing activated, allowing them to exceed the courtesy usage quota. Usage fees are billed using Google Checkout and charges are invoiced monthly.</li>
	<li><strong>Project keys</strong> - Each project can be identified by either an API key or an OAuth 2.0 token. Using this key/token in API requests will identify the project, and enable the recording of usage data, filtering restrictions, and bill usage to the proper project. Within the Console developers can  generate or revoke API keys or OAuth 2.0 certificates for specific application.</li>
	<li><strong>Team members </strong>- Team members can be established with read, write, or ownership access to each project's Console page.</li>
</ul>
The Google APIs Console supports fifteen separate Google APIs:

</ul>
The Google APIs Console provides a pretty comprehensive set of tools for developers and companies to manage their projects that integrate with various Google APIs.<p></p>
The traffic control and billing tools provide a peek into the future of how billing and monetization will occur for APIs as they become more of a utility in our every day lives.

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Discovery-Service.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />I just wrote about the potential of<a title="open source billing and traffic control" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/open-source-api-billing-and-traffic-control/">open source API billing and traffic control</a> building blocks, if Google would open source their <a title="API Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google API Console</a>, like they did with the <a title="Google API Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-explorer/">Google API Explorer</a>.<p></p>
I started bundling in thoughts on <a title="Google APIs Discovery Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/index.html">Google APIs Discovery Service</a> into that post, but then realized it is a separate issue, needing its own blog post.<p></p>
First, Google isn't about to open source Google API Discovery Service.  They issue developers of the Google APIs Discovery Service a <a title="patent license" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/patent-license.html">patent license</a>.  I couldn't find any more details tonight, but I'm assuming it puts this service in a different category than the rest.<p></p>
I wrote an <a title="overview of the Google APIs Discovery Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">overview of Google APIs Discovery Service</a>, but essentially it is a way to discover and describe Google APIs using an API.  Think <a title="Web Application Discovery Language (WADL)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">Web Application Description Language (WADL)</a>, with a API to access, and focused only on supported Google APIs.<p></p>
As the number of web APIs grow, the need for a discovery APIs and a standard description language will only grow.  We wil see services like Google APIs Discovery Service popup within specific industries and API areas.<p></p>
You see potential for this with <a title="Mashery's API Netowrk" href="http://developer.mashery.com/apis">Mashsery's API Network,</a> and even more evidence with <a title="Mashape's Marketplace" href="http://www.mashape.com/index">Mashape's Marketplace</a>.<p></p>
There aren't many companies with the number of APIs that Google has, so you won't see any single company building an API discovery service like that.<p></p>
However, I'd like to see API discovery services for cloud computing, social media, location-based, and telcommunication APIs appear making it easier for developers to discover, build code libraries, and integrate with common APIs.

<p>Of course this is virtual warehouse space, but it has a lot of the same characteristics of warehousing for physical products.</p>
<p>Google provides a <a title="3D Warehouse" href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/">3D Warehouse</a> for users of its <a title="SketchUp" href="http://sketchup.google.com/">SketchUp</a> softare, and <a title="Shapeways" href="http://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a> provides a marketplace and warehouse in the form a <a title="Gallery" href="http://www.shapeways.com/gallery">gallery</a> for its creators.</p>
<p>Cloud Storage will definitely have a role to play in warehousing the growing number of 3D modeling files using platforms like <a title="Google Docs" href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a>, <a title="Box.net" href="http://Box.net">Box.net</a>, and <a title="Dropbox" href="/admin/blog/www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>.</p>
<p>3D Warehouses need to provide search-able, sharable and collaborative spaces that are affordable for designers to store and retrieve their work.</p>
<p>As 3D printing becomes a larger part of the global manufacturing supply chain, virtual warehousing across the globe will also become necessary to provide localized storage solutions.</p>
<p>3D printing offers significant advantages over traditional manufacturing when it comes to warehousing, but it still will be a critical part of the <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.</p>

Someones idea to recreate an existing object, or a vision of an object they hold in their head.<p></p>
The evolution of 3D modeling software and 3D printers is creating a whole new generation of designers and creators.<p></p>
These 3D creators come from many walks of life; architects, product designers, graphic designers, artists. and beyond.<p></p>
Creators can build entire finished products, ranging from dinnerware to architectural components.<p></p>
Creators can also build parts and pieces of finished projects from nuts and bolts to replacement parts.<p></p>
3D designers and creators are often independent hobbyists and freelancers, but there are also a growing number of agencies and larger shops that are evolving along with 3D printing.<p></p>
Creators are just the first link in an evolving <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.

<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering">Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)</a></strong> - SLS is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass that has a desired 3-dimensional shape.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography">Stereolithography (SLA)</a> </strong>- Stereolithography is an additive manufacturing process using a vat of liquid UV-curable photopolymer resin and a UV laser to build parts a layer at a time. On each layer, the laser beam traces a part cross-section pattern on the surface of the liquid resin.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_deposition_modeling">Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)</a></strong> - FDM works on an additive principle by laying down material in layers. A plastic filament or metal wire is unwound from a coil and supplies material to an extrusion nozzle which can turn on and off the flow.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminated_object_manufacturing">Laminate Object Manufacturing (LOM)</a></strong> - LOM is a rapid prototyping system that layers adhesive-coated paper, plastic, or metal laminates are successively glued together and cut to shape with a knife or laser cutter.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are four of the common 3D printing methodologies and since the introduction of metal, 3D printing has moved past prototyping and art and has become a viable manufacturing technology.</p>
<p>3D printing processes and materials are the link that  allows virtual to become physical in the <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D print and manufacturing supply chain</a>.</p>

<p>Marketplaces will also go beyond showcasing 3D models, and actually act as marketplaces where items can be bid upon, creating virtual economies around 3D manufacturing.</p>
<p>These 3D economies will allow consumers to buy individual or bulk printed versions of 3D models.</p>
<p>3D marketplaces will provide competitive arenas, that creators and designers can find success by offering cheaper, unique and innovative 3D print products.</p>

<p>File formats often depend on the type of 3D modeling software used, but there are many common formats:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>.<strong>stl</strong> - STL is a file format native to the stereolithography CAD software created by 3D Systems.</li>
<li>.<strong>iges</strong> - The Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) (pronounced eye-jess) defines a neutral data format that allows the digital exchange of information among Computer-aided design (CAD) systems.</li>
<li>.<strong>obj</strong> - OBJ (or .OBJ) is a geometry definition file format first developed by Wavefront Technologies for its Advanced Visualizer animation package. The file format is open and has been adopted by other 3D graphics application vendors. For the most part it is a universally accepted format.</li>
<li>.<strong>3ds</strong> - 3DS is one of the file formats used by the Autodesk 3ds Max 3D modeling, animation and rendering software.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many things to consider when selecting a 3D modeling file format for 3D printing.</p>

<p>A 3D scanner is a device that analyzes a real-world object to collect data on its shape and possibly its appearance. The resulting data can then be used to construct 3D models.</p>
<p>3D scanning is no replacement for a human designer, but can offer a good start creating a 3D representation.</p>
<p>Each 3D scanner has its benefits and limitations, and resulting data will always need much work before it can be used in 3D printing.</p>
<p>3D scanners can offer a lot of benefit in rapid prototyping, and reverse engineering of existing objects.</p>
<p>Just like 3D printers you will find a wide range of 3D scanners, in both functionality and price.</p>
<p>You can also find innovative hobbyists employing tools like the Xbox Kinect for generating 3D scans.</p>

Apigee, Salesforce,  Google, Microsoft, and Infochimps have all deployed REST API Explorers to support developer integration.<p></p>
Facebook has now joined in....well a sort of.  Facebook employee Simon Cross developed a <a title="Facebook Graph API Explorer" href="https://www.simoncross.com/fb/graph/">Facebook Graph API explorer</a> for developers to use when working with the <a title="Facebook Graph API" href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/">Facebook Graph API</a>.<p></p>
The explorer lets developers specify and endpoint, and generate a JSON response, with or without an user login access token.<p></p>
Developers can also use the <a title="Facebook Graph API Explorer" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/16/the-semi-unofficial-facebook-graph-api-explorer/">Facebook Graph API explorer</a> for working FQL, which is the Facebook Query Language.<p></p>
Interesting that a Facebook employee was the one to develop and deploy the explorer, I'm sure its something Facebook will officially integrate into the Facebook developer area soon enough.

        Canada's <a title="Yellow Pages Group" href="http://www.ypg.com/en/">Yellow Pages Group (YPG)</a> launched a new developer ecosystem to support their local search and location based services (LBS) API, <a title="YellowAPI.com" href="http://www.yellowapi.com/">YellowAPI.com</a>.
<p></p><a title="YellowAPI.com" href="http://www.yellowapi.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/yellowAPI/yellow-api.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>YPG sees their developer ecosystem much differently than many other companies, they view the YellowAPI as a direct extension of its core business model, and the API dramatically extends the reach of its business network.
<p></p>Within many API communities, the API owners can often seem distant from developers, or even view the development community as a problem.
<p></p>As a developer I've experienced the limitations imposed by Twitter and Facebook, and I often feel ignored by Google when using their APIs.
<p></p>I see YellowAPI's strategy as the future of API ecosystem management.
<p></p>Developers can <a title="apply to be part of the YPG developer community" href="http://www.yellowapi.com/member/register">apply to be part of the YellowAPI.com developer community</a>, once approved they gain access to a wealth of resources, including consultation on application design, quality assurance, legal guidance, technical assistance and can receive funding assistance to take their applications live.
<p></p>In addition to these resources, YellowAPI.com provides opportunities for developers to monetize applications in the following ways:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Paid Search</strong> - Paying for volumes of high quality traffic from applications
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Wigets</strong> - Group buying solutions in Canada and "Deal of the Day" widgets
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Advertising</strong> - Platform specific digital ad network provided by Mediative
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Placement</strong> - Premium paid search using mobile placement products
     </li>
</ul>These aren't side opportunities invented just for the API, they represent YPG's core business.
<p></p><a title="Yellow Pages Group" href="http://www.ypg.com/en/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/yellowAPI/yellow-pages-group.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>Since YPG sees the API and its ecosystem as an extension of their core business, they are opening up revenue sharing opportunities for approved developers within its community.
<p></p>If the YellowAPI community is successful in building sustainable business applications, YPG benefits. And because of the forward thinking API ecosystem strategy, when YPG makes money, the API developer community shares in this revenue.
<p></p>How do you monetize your API, and where do your developers fit in?

Pearson's Plug &amp; Play Platform claims to unlock the company's large content bank which ranges from <a title="Dorling Kindersley (DK) Publishing" href="http://us.dk.com/">Dorling Kindersley (DK) Publishing's</a> illustrated guides to Pearson Education textbooks.<p></p>
The new API platform will allow developers to mash up Pearson content with other content and data to derive entirely to types of web, mobile and tablet products.<p></p>
Pearson's Future Technologies Group Product Manager, <a title="Diane Stepner" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/dianas">Diana Stepner</a>, says:
<blockquote><em>We recognise the world has changed and our content needs to be available for innovative uses outside Pearson. Plug &amp; Play opens up opportunities for DK and Pearson to connect with developers who are seeking the rich content we can share.</em></blockquote>
Pearson will be running initial platform tests using DK's Eyewitness Travel Guide material, then moving on to a wider range of subjects from science and natural history to gardening, parenting and early learning.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/publishing/dk-publishing.gif" alt="" width="175" align="right" /><p></p>
While it sounds promising that the world's largest education technology company is opening up its content via an API platform, Pearson doesn't reveal much information about just what this will entail.  What sorts of content will developers have access to?  What will access cost?  How will developers be able to monetize and license their projects that are based on the API?<p></p>
More details will be forthcoming, as Pearson says the Plug &amp; Play Platform is slated for launch in early 2012.

Affiliate members can earn up to 15% in commission for referrals to the site that result in a purchase.<p></p>
Amazon also provides a <a title="Product Advertising API" href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html?ie=UTF8&amp;pf_rd_t=501&amp;ref_=amb_link_84018271_9&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_p=&amp;pf_rd_s=assoc-right-1&amp;pf_rd_r=&amp;pf_rd_i=assoc_join_menu">Product Advertising API</a> for its more tech savvy affiliates to take advantage of.<p></p>

In addition to having access to the millions of products in its catalog, the Product Advertising API lets developers leverage Amazon's other features such as customer reviews, similar products, accessories, and listmania lists.<p></p>
The most important aspect of Amazons approach to its affiliate and API offerings is that it automatically formats the URLs returned by the API to include the associate tag, which is the piece that links a referral and purchase to a developers affiliate account.<p></p>
Amazon has been doing this a while, and they obviously have a solid vision of how an API and affiliate program can work together.

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/mimeo_connect_logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I'm working to make it easier to get up and running using the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.<p></p>
One concept that is tough to understand at first, is that all printing starts with a Mimeo document.<p></p>
Then using the API you can either order that document as is, or merge one or many PDF documents with it, generate a dynamic document, then order this new document.<p></p>
As part of our API, we have a Document Listing Service, except it only pulls documents from a central account I have control of.<p></p>
So if you want to pull one of the documents you created, you have to actually pull the Document ID from your My Mimeo account.<p></p>
Sounds easy right?  Well its available in the URL, and in a properties screen for the document.<p></p>
The Document ID is a GUID, for those of you who don't know what a GUID is:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A globally unique identifier or GUID (pronounced /??u??d/ or /??w?d/) is a unique reference number used as an identifier in computer software</em>
<em>So a Document ID looks like this:</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>3F2504E0-4F89-11D3-9A0C-0305E82C3301</em>
Except for some reason the one that shows in My Mimeo is missing the dashes, and doesn't work when you pass through the API.<p></p>
So I ask my API developer, where is the easiest place to get the Document ID?<p></p>
He says, "In the URL or as property of document".<p></p>
I explain it doesn't work without dashes.<p></p>
His response is, Developers will understand, and know to put dashes back in.<p></p>
And that is a hazard of putting developers as the public face of your API.<p></p>
They make a lot of assumptions based upon what they know.<p></p>
API Evangelists and developer advocates should definitely have programming skills, but ideally they should have a balance of proramming, business and marketing skills.

        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/shapeways/shapeways-widget.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />Embeddable widgets come in many formats, from JavaScript to iFrames, and are quickly becoming commonplace, especially within e-commerce platforms.</p>
<p>Embeddable objects allow users, especially non-developers to copy and paste content from web sites and embed within other sites, blogs, and social networks.</p>
<p>3D printing and manufacturing platform <a title="Shapeways" href="http://www.shapeways.com">Shapeways</a>, provides a <a title="marketplace for designers" href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops">marketplace for their designers</a> to sell their products, and also <a title="provides a set of widgets" href="http://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/830-Promoting-Your-Shop-With-The-Shapeways-Widget.html">provides a set of widgets</a> for users to promote the products they've created and published to their Shapeways shop.</p>
<p>The Shapeways widgets is a classic example of why RESTful APIs are so powerful.</p>
<p>Shapeway employs an iFrame widget where users can enter their shop name, and customize the number of rows and columns, and the height and width of the widget.</p>
<p>These embeddable widgets allow Shapeways shop owners to extend their presence beyond the Shapeways marketplace across the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>Does our e-commerce marketplace have an embed strategy?</p>

As an API Evangelist I look for other APIs that enhance the <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>, and try to figure out how I can leverage this, or at least tell the story.<p></p>
<a title="Google Cloud Print Services Interface" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/google-cloud-print-proxy-cloud-printer/">Google Cloud Print Services Interface</a> and the <a title="Box.net" href="http://www.box.net">Box.net</a> API have been two of my favorites so far. I also just finished a blog post about <a title="creating classroom and training materials with Crocodoc and Mimeo Connect" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=99">creating classroom training materials with Crocodoc and Mimeo Connect</a>.<p></p>
Today I saw that<a href="http://rdio.com">Rdio</a>, the social music service <a title="announce their partnership" href="http://blog.rdio.com/post/5161479190/announcing-rdios-partnership-with-the-echo-nest">announce their partnership</a> with <a title="The Echo Nest" href="http://the.echonest.com/">The Echo Nest</a>, a music intelligence platform.<p></p>
They are partnering behind the scenes, but I'm sure the API is the driving force behind this relationship.<a title="The Echo Nest" href="http://the.echonest.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/the-echo-nest.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a><p></p>
APIs enable new types of partnerships, and even allow API providers to work together and offer a more collective value.<p></p>
What other APIs do you think compliment each other, and should consider partnering?

        <span class="post-date">03 May 2011</span>
        In 2006, Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake coined the phrase <a title="Biz Dev 2.0" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">Biz Dev 2.0</a> in a blog post explaining how several small companies had approached Flickr wanting to provide services that the photo-sharing site didn't feature.<p></p>
She noted that Flickr executives had little time in their schedules to arrange meetings to hash out these partnerships, and instead encouraged companies to feel free to apply for a Commercial API key and build something off the API.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/flickr.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /><p></p>
<a title="Biz Dev 2.0" href="http://caterina.net/archive/000996.html">Biz Dev 2.0</a>, she called it.<p></p>
Fast forward to 2011, APIs are a common part of the technology and business landscape.<p></p>
Some API providers have evolved their API offerings into platforms, and introduced self-service application development environments.<p></p>
From the pubic side, these are seen as service or application marketplaces where users can find add-ons they can use as part of the core web application.<p></p>
Think <a title="Google Marketplace" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Marketplace</a>, <a title="Facebook App Directory" href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/directory.php">Facebook App Directory</a>, and <a title="Box.net OpenBox" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net OpenBox</a>.<p></p>
From the developers point of view these offer environments where they can easily build applications that integrate with an existing platform and user base.<p></p>
From the business perspective this is <a title="Biz Dev 2.5" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/bizdev-2-5-with-apis-and-self-service-platforms/">Biz Dev 2.5</a>.  Let me give you an example.<p></p>
When I started as API Evangelist for <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a> a project that was already in the works was commercial print integration with <a title="Scribd.com" href="http://www.scribd.com">Scribd.com</a>.   After serveral months of negotiations Mimeo was able to get a button within Scribd, Print to Mimeo.<p></p>
This happened before I was around, but right before I was hired Scribd updated their application to HTML5 and the Print to Mimeo disappeared.<p></p>
To get back on Scribd's development radar would take another round of outreach, discussion and integration into their development schedule.<p></p>
Next on my list of cloud storage provider integration after Scribd, was Box.net.<p></p>
Box.net has an API and a self-service application development environment called <a title="OpenBox" href="http://www.box.net/developers/actions">OpenBox</a>.  I can add my application and integrate it into Box.net without coordinating with Box.net staff.<p></p>
Once ready I can submit for approval in the OpenBox directory, or keep private and just send invites out to users with a link directly to my OpenBox application.<p></p>
I have someone I can email at Box.net and discuss business development opportunities, but I don't have to.  I can do all the work myself.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Box.net/box-net-250x161.jpg" alt="" align="right" /><p></p>
I'm able to build an application that uses the APIs of a leading web application provider, launch that application integrated into the platform, and access the existing user-base.   When users choose to use my application it adds actions or navigation options for them that are linked to my service.<p></p>
<a title="APIs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/api-listing.php">APIs</a> + <a title="self-service application development environments" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">self-service application development environments</a> allow for entirely new business opportunities without the overhead of traditional business development, and with deeper integration into partner platforms.

        <p><img style="margin: 25px; border: 1px solid #000;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/business-of-apis/Business-of-APIs-Front-Cover-Cropped.png" alt="" width="125" align="left" />With the recent <a title="explosion in the number ad usage of APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/programmable-web-3000-apis-and-growing/">explosion in the number and usage of APIs</a>, the Internet technology industry is well aware of the value of the application programming interface.  It recognizes that APIs drive much of the Internet from social media and cloud computing to mobile applications.</p>
<p>But while there is plenty of information to get the developer community up and running with APIs, there is a shortage of information that can serve to educate the <em>business</em> community about the business of APIs.</p>
<p>The necessity of having that sort of outreach is one reason why I use the term API Evangelist instead of Developer Advocate.  While yes, developers do still need advocates, I also feel that there needs to be more evangelism to the business community about APIs and their benefits as well.</p>
<p>So I've partnered with my girlfriend <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a> to develop a series of guides targeting the business community.  These aim to educate businesspeople about the coming <a title="API economy" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/19/the-new-api-economy/">API economy</a>.</p>
<p>We have just published our first guide:  <a title="Business of APIs" href="/business-of-apis.php">The Business of APIs</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the table of contents:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>What is an API?</li>
<li>Who uses APIs?</li>
<li>What type of technologies go into an API?</li>
<li>History of modern Web APIs</li>
<li>Where some APIs stumble</li>
<li>Building blocks for a successful API</li>
<li>Fostering an API ecosystem</li>
<li>BizDev 2.5</li>
</ol>
<p>An introduction to APIs, the book is aimed at a business audience, not the developer audience.  I believe that there are a lot of business owners, executives and decision makers out there considering APIs -- they've heard that it's "the thing to do" -- who need to be educated about how APIs work.&nbsp;<a title="Business of APIs" href="/business_of_apis.php">The Business of APIs</a> is a primer for just that sort of person.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/cloud-storage/Box-logo-new.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /> As the <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a> API Evangelist one of my jobs is to find other platforms, services and technology that goes well with the <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="../../">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>.<p></p>
One such platform that I've identified as a Mimeo.com partner platform is <a title="Box.net" href="http://www.box.net">Box.net</a>.<p></p>
Box.net provides a complete cloud storage platform, with a powerful developer platform and application directory called OpenBox.<p></p>
Mimeo.com provides commercial web to print services, and with Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API you can integrate print file management from Box.net<p></p>
<em>*** Heads up!! This requires basic understanding of box.net and programming with PHP ***</em><p></p>
To do this I sign up for a <a title="Box.net Developer Account" href="http://www.box.net/developers">Box.net developers account</a> and add new OpenBox application:
<ul class="blue">
	<li>Give Application Name and Description</li>
	<li>Assign a description page for the application that tells about my printer.</li>
</ul>
An important part of this application is a callback URL for when users first add the Box.net application. This has to be a page you host that handles the Box.net oAuth, which gives this print file manager access to a users account.<p></p>
Another important part of each application are whats called <em>service actions</em>.  Service actions which will show up for any user who adds this application to their Box.net account from OpenBox.<p></p>
For my Open Box Application I create a new service action:  <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Box.net/Open-Box.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="blue">
	<li>Give Application Service Action a title like, <strong><em>Send Print File toMimeo</em></strong></li>
	<li>Choose which document extensions my print file manager supports, PDF for now</li>
	<li>Enter a callback function which Box.net will send user when printing document</li>
	<li>Enter callback parameters such as URL, Title, Extension of Box.net file to be printed.</li>
</ul>
Save your service action, fill out any other relevant parts of your application and hit save as well.<p></p>
This creates your application at Box.net.<p></p>
Now you need put together the code that integrates Box.net with your Mimeo.com account using the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.<p></p>
First you need the OAuth piece of code described above, you can <a title="download at Github" href="https://github.com/mimeoconnect/Mimeo-Box.net">download this at Github</a>.  It requires the following files:
<ul class="blue">
	<li>box_config.php</li>
	<li>boxlibphp5.php</li>
	<li>class.curl.php</li>
	<li>index.php</li>
</ul>
This will allow your print file manager to OAuth with Box.net.<p></p>
Now you need the actual code that lets you pull the file being passed by Box.net and print uses Mimeo.com.<p></p>
Here is a sample code file for doing this:<p></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/950096.js?file=Box.net%20-%20Mimeo%20Connect%20Print%20File%20Manager"></script><p></p>

Recently they made a huge effort in turning this around, with a campaign called <a title="Operation Developer Love" href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/495">Operation Developer Love</a>.<p></p>
Each week they recap whats happened within the development community and provide some other nuggets of information:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Code Samples</li>
	<li>Forum Activity</li>
	<li>Bugzilla Activity</li>
</ul>
This week they also provided an overview of how they are improving their documentation.<p></p>
They also provide some insight into some developer site latency, and how they've move the site to some new servers and show a graph of significantly improved performance.

This creates your application at Box.net.<p></p>
Now you need put together the code that integrates Box.net with your Mimeo.com account using the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.<p></p>
First you need the OAuth piece of code described above, you can <a title="download at Github" href="https://github.com/mimeoconnect/Mimeo-Box.net">download this at Github</a>.  It requires the following files:
<ul class="blue">
	<li>box_config.php</li>
	<li>boxlibphp5.php</li>
	<li>class.curl.php</li>
	<li>index.php</li>
</ul>
This will allow your bound document printer to OAuth with Box.net.<p></p>
Now you need the actual code that lets you pull the file being passed by Box.net and print uses Mimeo.com.<p></p>
Here is a sample code file for doing this:<p></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/950054.js?file=Box.net%20-%20Mimeo%20Connect%20Bound%20Document%20Printer"></script><p></p>
The above code sample demonstrates how to build a <a title="bound" href="../../blog/blog_detail.php?ID=90">bound document printer using Box.net cloud storage and Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>.<p></p>
With this bound document printer you can public books, magazines, newsletters, reports and many other types of bound documents.<p></p>
You can build any custom bound document with your Mimeo.com account, with specific binding, paper, folds, covers, and much more.  Then merge this document with any multi-page document from Box..net<p></p>
Any company can build a Box.net Cloud Printer and publish to the OpenBox directory, to allow commercial printing using<p></p>
Mimeo.com  You can dowload a complete library of <a title="PHP code samples for integrating Box.net with Mimeo.com" href="https://github.com/mimeoconnect/Mimeo-Box.net">PHP code samples for integrating Box.net with Mimeo.com</a> at Github.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/internal-business-users.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />When it comes to APIs, and who uses them, we often think about partners. Sharing data and resources with partners has long been the number one reason for deploying APIs.
<p></p>With the increased popularity of web APIs, many companies are opening up their APIs to the general public and freelance developers as well.
<p></p>In addition to partner and public developers, there has been a recent trend in APIs being adopted internally, within a company. Many companies are finding success in eating their own dog food and building web and mobile applications using the same API infrastructure offered externally.
<p></p>As an API evangelist, there can be a lot of value in encouraging API adoption by internal users.
<p></p>Internal usage of APIs can increase efficiencies by sharing data and resources between departments and separate company locations.
<p></p>However you can also increase overall company support and resources available to API efforts through internal adoption.
<p></p>With increased internal usage, decision makers within a company see the value first hand and are more willing to approve budgets needed to develop more APIs, tools and resources that can be used by partners, public developers, as well as within the company.
<p></p>Lack of budget and business resources are the number one reason API efforts fail or find limited success.
<p></p>Remember to evangelize internally within your company, not just to partners and the public.

        <a title="DeltaCloud API" href="http://incubator.apache.org/deltacloud/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/deltacloud-logo.PNG" alt="" align="right" /></a>Not all <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com">APIs</a> are the same. Even with <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/api-technology-rest/">RESTful</a> approaches to delivering APIs they can be quite different.
<p></p>As APIs grow and as we want to be able to connect apps to multiple inputs and endpoints, there's an increasing need to make the process easier, more streamlined, and interoperable.
<p></p>One example of this is within the <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/cloud-computing/">cloud computing</a> industry. When using AmazonEC2 and Rackspace, developers have to write separate code to integrate with each platform.
<p></p>Another example is with social networks, when pulling social streams from <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/facebook/">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/twitter/">Twitter</a>, developers have to develop separate code for each provider as well.
<p></p>An new approach to solving differences between APIs that deliver similar functionality, but use different approaches, is to build a unified API.
<p></p>Unified APIs bring together multiple APIs into a single interface. Two examples of this are:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="DeltaCloud API" href="http://incubator.apache.org/deltacloud/">DeltaCloud API</a> - With the Deltacloud API you can start an instance on an internal cloud, then with the same code start another on <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/amazon/amazon-ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> or Rackspace.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Windsoc" href="http://www.windsoc.co/">Windsoc API</a></strong> - Using Windsoc API developers can access Facebook, Twitter, GoogleBuzz and other social APIs using a single interface.
     </li>
</ul>Unified APIs do a lot of the work for developers, by providing a single interface to build against, as well as compensating for changes between APIs, and different versions of an API.<a title="Windsoc" href="http://www.windsoc.co/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/windsoc.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></a>
<p></p>Cloud computing APIs and social network APIs have been around for a few years now, it makes sense that there is a need for a unified interface.
<p></p>What other industries or types of APIs are in need of an unified API?

<p></p>API contestsand hackathons.
<p></p>API providers like <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a> and <a title="Netflix" href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> are using them to attract new users, and to generate buzz and innovation around their API.
<p></p>When I'm out at events, educating business users about APIs, I often get asked about the viability of contests and hackathons to generate free code and applications for an API community.
<p></p>I think there is a common misconception amongst the business community that API owners can get away with not paying developers to build code and applications, by just framing what they want in the form of a contest or hackathon, and developers will all rally, and work for free.
<p></p>While you can potentially develop usable code and applications in this environment, its not always the case, and definitely should not be the focus of an event.
<p></p>API contests and hackathons are purely a marketing vehicle for generating attention around an API. Sure there are some secondary effects, like innovative code, apps, ideas, and developer talent, but these aren't a given.
<p></p>Focus on a healthy, innovative reason for your API contest or hackathon. Apply the resources to make the sure event gets heard about across all relevant developer circles, and when the event happens, make sure it is all about the developers.
<p></p>Envision your API contest or hackathon as the marketing vehicle it is, and the rest take care of itself.

        <span class="post-date">26 Apr 2011</span>
        <p>I'm doing a lot of researching and thinking about the future of commercial printing, 3D printing, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was brainstorming on <a title="3D printing and manufacturing with Google" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/04/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-with-google/">3D printing and manufacturing with Google</a>.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-sketchup/Google-SketchUp.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Tonight I'm learning more about <a title="Google SketchUp" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/">Google SketchUp</a>,which <a title="Google added to Google Apps" href="http://googlesmb.blogspot.com/2010/12/now-available-with-google-apps-google_03.html">Google added toGoogle Apps</a> in December of 2010.</p>
<p>Google SketchUp allows anyone to build 3D models to the <a title="STL file format" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)">STL file format</a>, a standard for the 3D print industry.</p>
<p>3D printers like <a title="Shapeways" href="http://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a> lets you upload your STL files, print and order them in their physical form..</p>
<p>Google SketchUp provides a free and professional version of the modeling software.</p>
<p>They also provide a <a title="3D Warehouse" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/product/3dwh.html">3D Warehouse</a> where you can find a collection of 3D models that are free to use.</p>
<p>There is a <a title="community of resources" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/community/">community of resources</a> as well as <a title="training" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/training/">training</a> and <a title="education" href="http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/industries/education.html">education</a> materials to learn about the platform.</p>
<p>Everything is there to build models to be used in 3D printing and manufacturing.  The only missing link right now is integration with Google Cloud Print.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/shapeways_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Maybe Google will support STL file printing in the <a title="Google Cloud Print Services Interface" href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/google-cloud-print-services-interface/">Google Cloud Print  (GCP) Services Interface</a> soon.</p>
<p>3D printers like Shapeways could register their 3-D printers with GCP like I'm doing with <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a> for commercial printing.</p>
<p>Lots of possibilities for 3D printing and manufacturing with Google Sketchup, Google Cloud Print, and 3D printers like Shapeways.</p>

At the same time I'm involved with the rollout of <a title="Google Cloud Print Services Interface" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/google-cloud-print-proxy-cloud-printer/">Google Cloud Print Services Interface</a>, an API for managing printing to any printer over the Internet.<p></p>
I'm using <a title="Google Docs as a Publishing Platform" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/google-docs-as-a-publishing-platform/">Google Docs as a publishing platform</a>, integrating Google Cloud Print with the <a title="Mimeo Connect API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect API</a> and evolving whats possible with commercial cloud printing.<p></p>
Google has added <a title="Support for many more native file formats in Google Docs" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/google-docs-file-formats-viewer-web-and-api/">support for many more native file formats in Google Docs</a>.  Now all they need to do is add support for common 3D printing file formats:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>.<a title=".stl file format" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)">stl</a> - STL is a file format native to the stereolithography CAD software created by 3D Systems.</li>
	<li>.<a title=".iges file format" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGES">iges</a> - The Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) (pronounced eye-jess) defines a neutral data format that allows the digital exchange of information among Computer-aided design (CAD) systems.</li>
	<li>.<a title=".obj file format" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file">obj</a> - OBJ (or .OBJ) is a geometry definition file format first developed by Wavefront Technologies for its Advanced Visualizer animation package. The file format is open and has been adopted by other 3D graphics application vendors. For the most part it is a universally accepted format.</li>
	<li>.<a title=".3ds file format" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.3ds">3ds</a> - 3DS is one of the file formats used by the Autodesk 3ds Max 3D modeling, animation and rendering software.</li>
</ul>
To support 3D printing file formats I'm sure they will have to introduce a new app to the Google Apps suite or evolve Google Drawings.<p></p>
Google Drawings only supports importing of .wmf files and exporting of .jpg, .pdf, .png, and .svg formats.<p></p>
I'm working on some modifications to the Google Cloud Print capabilities definition via .ppd or .xps for commericial cloud printing, I think we could also bend this definition to support 3D printing and mnufacturing.<p></p>
We have a ways to go, but I see the future of cloud 3D printing and manufacturing unfold in front of us with 3-D printing and cloud printing.

<p></p>As I'm organizing these snippets of code into <a title="Snippely" href="http://code.google.com/p/snippely/">Snippely</a>, I'm thinking about all the effort I've put into getting content.
<p></p>I've harvested government data, craigslist posting, real estate listings, and a wide variety of news, products, and geo-data.
<p></p>If I need some data, I much prefer using an API, but if I have a need and there is data available on a web page...I just harvest it.
<p></p>If a content provider does not have an open API, I view them much differently than if they do. I see them as a source of content, there is no real relationship. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/harvesting.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> When a content provider has an open API, I will use their API. If the API offers enough value, I will pay to use it, and establish a relationship with the content provider.
<p></p>Content providers will have far more control over their content by providing an open API, even if the content is also available on their site. This control will allow owners to track usage and even monetize it.
<p></p>I would much prefer to pull data and other content from an API rather than scrape or harvest it.

<a title="Phaxio" href="http://www.phaxio.com/">Phaxio</a>, an API that allows developers to <a title="integrating faxing capabilities into application" href="http://www.phaxio.com/">integrate faxing capabilities into their applications</a>, has  email invitation as a main menu option in its API area.<p></p>
The Phaxio API is in private beta, but existing users can send off a Phaxio invitation code that allows other developers to discover and sign up for the faxing service.<p></p>
Application email invites are clearly not something new.  And with the growth of social media, it may be that sharing via Twitter or Facebook has become more associated with the steps necessary to make things "go viral."  Nevertheless, having the ability to send out invitations via email can still provide essential word-of-mouth marketing for your API and shouldn't be overlooked.

        <span class="post-date">21 Apr 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-popularity.png" alt="" width="375" align="right" />How do you measure the popularity of your API, or someone else's API?<p></p>
If its your API, hopefully you have metrics established for every part of your API and supporting API area.<p></p>
But how can we measure the API space as a whole?  I get asked a lot about, what are the top APIs out there.<p></p>
<a title="ProgrammableWeb Measures Popularity" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?sort=mashups">ProgrammableWeb measures popularity</a> by the number of mashups that are built on an API.  Using this metric, Google Maps, Twitter, Flickr and Youtube rise to the top.<p></p>
Not all APIs are suited for mashups, and we definitely need more ideas of how to measure popularity and usage of Open APIs.<p></p>
I would start by using <a title="Alexa" href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a>, <a title="Compete" href="http://www.compete.com/">Compete</a>, and <a title="Quantcast" href="http://www.quantcast.com/">Quantcast</a> who provide SEO related analytics and ranking for web sites.<p></p>
Next I would look at the number of partners an API has showcased in their developers area or web site.<p></p>
After partners I would look for the number of developers showcased as part of an API ecosystem.  Not all APIs provide tools for developers to have a public profile, but if they do, this can be an important measurement.<p></p>
After the number of partner and public users, I would take a close look at how many applications are developed on a platform.  Both internally and community developed applications.  These represent completed projects where developers have successfully integrated with an API.<p></p>
Then I think overall API community activity and resources would be a good thing to measure.  How many code samples, language kits, FAQ, forum posts, and other resources are provided. This reflects the amount of resources a company and community has put into an API.<p></p>
There is no perfect way to measure the success and popularity of an API on the open Internet, but these are a few ideas for variables the industry might consider when developing an algorithm for tracking the popularity of APIs in this fast growing space.

        <span class="post-date">21 Apr 2011</span>
        As an <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> I'm always grouping and targeting my API consumers, to better meet their needs and identify their role within my <a title="API Ecosystem" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem.php">API ecosystem</a>.
<p></p>The three main groups that I break my API users into, are:<img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=300x225&amp;cht=p3&amp;chd=s:SSMG&amp;chdl=Partner|Public|Inernal|Platform&amp;chdlp=b&amp;chma=1,1,1,1&amp;chtt=API+Ecosystem&amp;chts=000000,14" alt="API Ecosystem" width="300" height="225" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Partners Developers
     </li>
     <li>Public Developers
     </li>
     <li>Internal Developers
     </li>
</ul>When I first started working with APIs, I generally focused on API access for partners.
<p></p>With the introduction of Open APIs, I began paying attention to a wider audience of developers from different countries, industries, programming languages and platforms.
<p></p>Recently APIs are also being recognized for their use internally. API owners often target other departments or business locations when deploying or consuming APIs.
<p></p>As the API Evangelist for <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a>, I'm seeing a new target emerge, platform partners.
<p></p>Platform partners are tend to be other complimentary APIs and / or <a title="self-service application platforms" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/anatomy-of-a-self-service-application-platforms/">self-service application platforms</a> like <a title="Box.net" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/box-net-openbox/">Box.net</a> and <a title="Google Apps Marketplace" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/08/google-apps-marketplace/">Google Apps Marketplace</a>.
<p></p>Just like with my partners, public, and internal developers I'm developing specific strategies, code samples, documentation and other tools targeting my designated partner platforms.
<p></p>Partner platforms are quickly becoming an important part of my API ecosystem, we'll see where this trend goes.
