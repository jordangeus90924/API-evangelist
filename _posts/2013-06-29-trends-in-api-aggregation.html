<p>One trend in API usage I'm closely watching is the <a title="API Aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">aggregation of APIs by a new wave of startups</a>. As the world adopts more cloud services, the need to aggregate content across multiple APIs is growing.

<li>Invoicing</li>
<li>Messaging</li>

<p>The companies I'm watching on may provide other services, such as integration or automation between cloud services.  However I focus on the aggregation of content and data, and the creation of new, aggregated APIs across multiple services.

<p>In 2013 we will continue seeing API aggregation providers emerge, providing a new layer on top of the most popular API services that we are quickly growing dependent on.
