{% include JB/setup %}<p>I wrote about the need for more Transit APIs a couple weeks ago, and the opportunity for some company or organization to step up and coordinate transit APIs on a global, country, regional and local level.Also the opporunity for developers to provide local resources for building applications, acquiring of local data, understanding local constraints, and be the overall contact for a specific locale.To me, there appears to be a hunger for transit data, and there is a major gap in how this public data is being made available for developers to build websites, web and mobiles apps, that businesses and commuters can use.The opportunity is so big, that tech savvy commuters are stepping up, scraping data, and building transit APIs and applications themselves.I had a lot of people contact me after my post, but one clear player emerged, that appears to be just the company I was looking for.</p>
