{% include JB/setup %}<p>In my Google Reader I curate hundreds of articles pulled from 600+ blogs and 25+ real-time Google Alerts, on a daily basis.Everything I star in my Google Reader or Tweet about daily ends up in my Pinboard account.In addition to this curation, I bookmark every relevant site and post I come across in my daily surfing using the Pinboard bookmarklet.Using the Pinboard API I setup a news curation system at API Evangelist which pulls my latest pinboards every 15 minutes and adds them to a curation queue which I monitor every couple hours.My API Evangelist curation system allows me to add comments and tags, further adding meaning to what Iâ€™ve already read throughout the day.</p>
