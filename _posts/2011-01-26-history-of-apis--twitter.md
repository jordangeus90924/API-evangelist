[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/Twitter-Introducing-The-Twitter-API.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />][1]On September 20, 2006 [Twitter introduced the Twitter API to the world][1].

Much like the [release of the eBay API][2], Twitter's API release was in response to the growing usage of Twitter by those scraping the site or creating [rogue APIs][3].

Twitter exposed the [Twitter API][4] via a [Restful][5] interface using [JSON][6] and [XML][7].

In the beginning, Twitter used Basic Auth for API authentication, resulting the now infamous [Twitter OAuth Apocalypse][8] almost four years later, when Twitter forced all those using the API to switch to OAuth.

In four short years Twitters API has become the center of countless desktop clients, [mobile][9] applications, web apps, and businesses -- even by Twitter itself, in its IPhone, IPad, Android apps via its public website.
