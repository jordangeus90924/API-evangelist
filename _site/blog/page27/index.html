        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/08/08/access-to-satellite-imagery-via-a-web-api/">Access To Satellite Imagery Via A Web API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.astrodigital.com/api/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/landsat-api.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a>In 2006 Amazon introduced me to the idea that you could deploy global infrastructure using web APIs. This was when web APIs went from the hobby level (ie. photos, social, links) workbench, and became a tool I could actually use in my business toolbox. Web APIs weren't just used or fun and games anymore, opening up my eyes to the endless possibilities when you make the web programmable using APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016, I see a number of APIs show up on my monitoring radar, and honestly, most of them are not that notable--then you come across the solutions like the dead simple <a href="https://www.astrodigital.com/api/">satellite imagery API from Astro Digital</a>. I'm increasingly finding myself tracking on the collision APIs are having with our physical world, so I see a lot of interesting (and some not so) APIs, but I find the notion that you can get the latest picture of a specific place on earth is a pretty significant milestone for web APIs.</p>
<p>For me the Astro Digital satellite imagery API demonstrates for me the power of the&nbsp;Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)--I can get a snapshot of any location on earth, and manipulate my view of it using a single URI, from within any web or mobile application. This is just one of many APIs available to the average developer today, providing access to a wealth of high-value resources, that used to only be accessible to larger companies who could afford it.</p>
<p>I just wanted to pause for a moment, and take notice of some of the important resources that are being made available via APIs today, because I feel like the landscape is shifting pretty quickly with the introduction of these valuable resources. When companies small companies can work with the same resources as large enterprises and institutions, interesting things are possible.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-broken.png" alt="" width="32%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have done a lot of reading in the last week, catching up on my monitoring of the API space. I have read a couple of posts about the reliability of APIs, and the overall viability of building applications, and businesses based upon them. A couple of the posts were focusing on <a href="https://medium.com/@anildash/the-end-of-thinkup-e600bc46cc56#.9dhazj3vf">the shuttering of ThinkUp</a>, but a couple others were just part of the regular flow of these stories that question whether we can depend on APIs or not--nothing new, as this is a regular staple of bloggers and the wider tech blogosphere.</p>
<p>My official stance on this line of thinking is that I would not want to be building a business, and application that depends on leading API platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and others, but I will happily build a business, applications, and system integration on APIs. You see, this isn't an API issue, it is a business and vendor viability issue. As with other sectors, there are badly behaved business, and there are well-behaved businesses--I try to choose to do business with the well-behaved one's (can't always achieve this, but I try).</p>
<p>I find the ongoing desire of the startup culture to point out how unreliable APIs are, while simultaneously&nbsp;supporting the overall business tone set by venture capital investment, often delusionally blind levels of support, is just not reconcilable. I'm not saying all VC investment is bad, so don't even take this down that road. I am saying that the quest for VC investment, and the shift in priorities once VC investment is acquired, then further shift with each additional round, and the final exit is setting a tone that is completely at odds with API reliability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem really begins when APIs become the front-end for this blame. If I depend on vendors for my brick and mortar store, and the delivery trucks don't reliably bring my products, I don't talk about how you can't depend on trucks--I find new vendors. Of course, I can't find new vendors if they can't be replaced like Twitter and Facebook, but this is a whole other conversation, although it is also one that is a symptom of the tone being set by the VC currents (this is a business conversation). Blaming APIs instead of raising questions about the business ethics bar being set by venture capital shows the blinding power of greed, as the tech community refuses to blame VC $$, and shifts this to being about the viability of APIs, because I will get my VC $$ some day too bro!</p>
<p>I am not saying APIs are always good. I'm just saying they aren't bad. Hell, they aren't neutral. They are a simply a reflection of the business behind them, as well as being a reflection of the industry they operate in. Stop blaming them for businesses not giving a shit about developers, and the end-users. Maybe we could start changing the tone by admitting the #1 priority is always set by VC $$, and not by our API community, or even our end-users and customers, and all this shit is out of whack.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-footprint.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've seen quite a few&nbsp;incomplete&nbsp;API efforts in my time as the API Evangelist. It is why I aggregate the most common building blocks I see across successful API providers like Twilio and organize them into blueprints anyone can follow like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/my-minimum-viable-api-footprint-definition/">my minimum viable API footprint definition</a>. It doesn't take much effort to pull together a basic API presence like this&nbsp;and is something that can go a long ways to help onboard new API consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a number of interesting APIs out there like <a href="https://dl.ubnt.com/aircontrol/aircontrol-api-alpha.pdf">the AirControl API</a>, which gives you <a href="https://www.ubnt.com/products/">programmatic access to enterprise-grade wifi and wireless network solutions from Ubiquiti Networks</a>, but then quickly reduces a pretty robust API effort to being just a PDF document. I still keep an eye on these APIs like this because they offer value, and give a look at how ubiquitous web APIs are becoming. It also demonstrates how much more work I have ahead of me when it comes to educating the coming wave of device API providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing this demonstrates for me&nbsp;is that this wave of Internet-connected device APIs will also suffer from many of the same illnesses that API providers have had when deploying APIs for mobile applications. These APIs are often hastily designed and deployed, where documentation, authentication, and security are often an&nbsp;afterthought or not even a thought at all.</p>
<p>I am working on reworking some of my forkable Github templates for deploying API portals. I am going to c<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/my-minimum-viable-api-footprint-definition/">reate a minium viable API portal solution</a> that can be easily&nbsp;forked, helping API providers quickly launch a more coherent presence&nbsp;without much effort. I'm going to also create a complete API portal solution that takes into consideration <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/07/i-have-an-api-now-i-need-some-help-to-identify-what-is-needed-to-manage-my-api-presence/">the complete list of building blocks for an API presence</a> that I've gathered from across the API landscape.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-diff.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>As the number of available <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> out there grows, I am increasingly coming across variations of APIs that I already have included in my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a>. It can be tedious to try and sync these with existing copies, so I wanted to take a look and see if there was anything already available out there, that would help provide a diff for either OpenAPI Spec, RAML, or API Blueprint.</p>
<p>The most common one I found referenced was <a href="https://github.com/civisanalytics/swagger-diff">a Ruby one for OpenAPI Spe</a>c from&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/civisanalytics">Civis Analytics</a>. Next, I found a pretty <a href="https://zallek.github.io/swagger-diff/">interesting web tool</a>, which provides its <a href="https://github.com/zallek/swagger-diff/">Node.js source code on Github</a>, including a CLI edition. After these two solutions, I only found <a href="https://github.com/myexpr/raml-diff">one more for RAML</a>, but couldn't find anything for API Blueprint.</p>
<p>I wanted to think beyond just the common API definition formats&nbsp;and look for diff tools that would work just for JSON. I found <a href="https://github.com/andreyvit/json-diff">Diff</a> which was pretty interesting, as well as <a href="https://github.com/janmonschke/diffsync">DiffSync</a> which provided a real-time&nbsp;diff for JSON. I haven't tried any of them out, I am just trying to compile a list of what is out there&nbsp;before I dive into what their capabilities are.</p>
<p>I have a master database of API definitions where I can just import API definitions that I find, and it will add any new paths, parameters, and schemas it comes across. I would much rather have the ability to just run each version through a diff tool, and be able to select which elements I want to have merged. For now, I will just implement a custom layer to my API monitoring system, but I would like to see API diff move forward similar to we saw the conversation evolve with the introduction of&nbsp;<a href="https://apitransformer.com/">API Transformer</a>.</p>

<p>I first came across Airmap as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/02/direct-government-connection-into-internet-of-things-devices-like-we-are-seeing-with-drones/">I was learning about them acting as the middle man for DJI drone updates via the Department of Interior</a>. After this story, I added them to my database of companies that I track on. Then as I was monitoring my feeds I saw <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSFWN1AK0VL?type=companyNews">they were now working with IBM to get weather information</a> for use by drone manufacturers, operators, and those impacted by drone activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.airmap.com/">Airmap</a>&nbsp;positions themselves as "airspace Intelligence", offering low-altitude airspace management solution for unmanned aircraft. When you consider the drone as just one of many devices being connected to the Internet, the role intelligence providers like Airmap will play when it comes to system to system integrations, and web or mobile application development in each space--the company seems to be well-positioned for success in the drone industry.</p>
<p>Airmap is working hard to define the physical space, the constants, as well as some of the most ephemeral layers of our physical world like weather, forest fires, and events that are increasingly impacting our online reality via the web and our mobile phones. Airmap is aggregating valuable data, like the <a href="http://tfr.faa.gov/tfr2/list.html">updates they get from the Department of Interior (open data)</a> to the partner data like they will be ingesting like the weather data from IBM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Airmap provides access to their&nbsp;<a href="https://sdk.airmap.io/">flight conditions and other airspace data from Airspace via API(s)</a>, and has established&nbsp;some pretty significant manufacturer relationships, as well as open and partner data sources--providing the beginnings of a pretty interesting Internet of things business blueprint for what I'd consider to be a sort of API broker. When you consider the influence some of these API brokers have in the&nbsp;governance of airspace around nuclear power plants or even the Olympics, and govern an assortment of&nbsp;Internet-connected devices--the API opportunity appears to be pretty interesting.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.bbb.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bbb.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was happy to stumble across the <a href="https://developer.bbb.org">Better Business Bureau API</a> the other day. I was working on a piece about "the API economy", and looking for real world examples of how APIs could actually contribute positively (or negatively) to the actual economy, and found the useful API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Better Business Bureau&nbsp;provides five API endpoints for consumers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.bbb.org/documentation/endpoints/organization-search/">Organization Search</a></strong> - This endpoint will allow you to search for Organizations that are known to the BBB. &nbsp;Organizations may include businesses or charities.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.bbb.org/documentation/endpoints/organization-collections/">Organization Collections</a> -</strong> BBB Partners will need to be able to identify collections of Organizations that they care about and be able to manage those collections and receive Organization info and updates on them as needed.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.bbb.org/documentation/endpoints/bulk-retrieval/">Bulk Retrieval</a> -</strong> This section defines the message specification that will be sent back to the API partners who request a bulk data transfer. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.bbb.org/documentation/endpoints/push-notifications/">Push Notifications</a> - </strong>BBB Partners have the need to be notified when BBB data updates occur for the records or a collection of records they are currently subscribed to.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.bbb.org/documentation/endpoints/bbb-investigation-application-for-accreditation/">BBB Investigation/Application for Accreditation</a></strong> - This endpoint allows submission of organizations for BBB investigation and application for BBB accreditation.</li>
</ul>
<p>They provide&nbsp;a pretty valuable service, which is significantly amplified when there is an API present. Being able to find out which companies are accredited or have complaints against them in real time has endless potential for impacting real world decisions that may influence the economy one way or the other. Being able to automate this process for a digital age, convinced me that this should be in the list of APIs that reflect my thoughts on the wider API economy.</p>
<p>I will be including the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.bbb.org">Better Business Bureau API</a>&nbsp;in my overall API ranking research, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/31/how-are-we-going-to-create-the-standard-and-poors-and-moodys-for-the-api-economy/">which is something I've explored in the past</a>, but will be spending some more time thinking in the&nbsp;context of the API economy. I will also profile the BBB API, to contribute to the design patterns I will be considering when it comes to designing business and API ranking, investigation, and accreditation&nbsp;resources.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-shaming-api.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was reading some of the blog posts, Reddit&nbsp;and Hacker News threads about <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines">Microsoft's release of their API design guid</a>e. While many of the comments are technically correct, the tone in which they are delivered, and the intent behind their delivery is one of the biggest contributing factors to why we have such wild inconsistencies in API design across the landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>API Evangelist was born in 2010 out of frustration with the Restafarian pundit class. I made it my mission to help tell stories of the technical, business, and politics of APIs in an inclusive way, that didn't make people feel stupid for what they didn't understand. Even after six years of doing this, I am still learning things about APIs and being regularly reminded that there are few absolutes when it comes API design, definition, deployment, management, or any of <a href="http://apievangelist.com">the other 50+ stops along the API life cycle that I track on</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stopped sharing my blog posts to Hacker News, Reddit, and DZone (reversed after they invested in change) because of hostile responses to my thoughts. I cannot imagine what it is like to work hard on your API design strategy at a company, then share publicly, only to get flamed because it wasn't REST compliant. Many folks will never even attempt this for fear of being flamed, and those that do, will often never make the mistake twice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the opposite of what we want. We want EVERYONE organizing, publishing, and sharing their API design patterns so that we can all learn from each other. We don't want to make people feel stupid for what they do not know. We want to encourage everyone to learn, grow, evolve, and build on each other's design patterns and work from across the API sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's work to encourage more companies to craft, publish, and share their API design patterns. Let's please stop REST shaming folks, it didn't work in 2010, and it doesn't work in 2016. Making people feel dumb will never get us to a place where API developers and architects are truly HTTP&nbsp;literate, and well informed of existing patterns, let alone actually putting them to work across their organizations.&nbsp;</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/08/04/pushing-for-more-algorithmic-transparency-using-apis/">Pushing For More Algorithmic Transparency Using APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">04 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-algorithmic-transparency-2.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I saw the potential for collaboration when it came to using web APIs back around 2004 and 2005. I was seeing innovative companies opening up their digital assets to the world using low-cost, efficient Internet technology like HTTP, opening things up for potentially interesting approaches to collaboration around the development of web and mobile applications on top of valuable digital resources. This approach has brought us valuable platforms like Amazon Web Services and SalesForce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Common API discussions tend to focus on providing APIs to an ecosystem of developers&nbsp;and encouraging the development of&nbsp;web and mobile applications, widgets, visualizations, and other integrations that benefit the platform. In the course of these operations, it is also customary to gather feedback from the community&nbsp;and work to evolve the APIs design, available resources, and even the underlying data model--extending collaboration to also be about the APIs, and underlying resources, in addition to just building things on top of the API.</p>
<p>This approach to designing, defining, and deploying APIs, and then also web and mobile applications on top of these APIs is nothing new, and is something that I have been tracking on for over the last six years. The transparency that can be injected into the evolution of data, content, and potentially the "algorithms behind" with APIs is significant, which is how it became such a big part of my professional mission, and fueling my drive to spread the "gospel" whenever and wherever I can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, so how can APIs contribute to algorithmic transparency? To fully grasp where I am taking this, you need to understand that APIs can be used as an input and output for data, content, as well as algorithms. Let's use Twitter as an example. Using Twitter and the Twitter API I can read and write data about myself, or any user, using the /account and /users API endpoints--providing the content and data portion of what I am talking about.</p>
<p>When it comes to the algorithm portion, Twitter API has several methods, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/user_timeline">GET statuses/user_timeline</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/home_timeline">GET statuses/home_timeline</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/search/tweets">GET search/tweets</a>, which return a "timeline of Tweet data". In 2006 this timeline was just the latest Tweets from the users you follow, in sequential order. In 2016, you will get "content powered by a variety of signals". In short, <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/164083">the algorithm that drives the Twitter timeline is pretty complicated</a>, with a number of things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your home timeline displays a stream of Tweets from accounts you have chosen to follow on Twitter.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You may see suggested content powered by a variety of signals.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Tweets you are likely to care about most will show up first in your timeline.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You may see a summary of the most interesting Tweets you received since your last visit</li>
<li>You may also see content such as promoted Tweets or Retweets in your timeline.</li>
<li>Additionally, when we identify a Tweet, an account to follow, or other content that's popular or relevant, we may add it to your timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of considerations that would go into any one timeline response--this is Twitter's algorithm. While I technically have access to this algorithm via three separate API endpoints, there really isn't much algorithmic transparency present, <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/164083">beyond their overview in the support section</a>. Most companies are going to claim this is their secret sauce and their intellectual property. That is fine, I don't have a problem with y'all being secretive about this, even though I will always push you to be more open, as well as leave the API layer out of your patents you use to pretect your algorithms.</p>
<p>Algorithmic transparency with APIs is not something that should be applied to all APIs in my opinion, but for regulated industries, and truly open API solutions, transparency can go a long way, and bring a number of benefits. All Twitter (and any other API provider) has to do is add parameters, and corresponding that open up the variables of the underlying algorithm for each endpoint. What goes into considerations about "what I care about", constitutes "interesting", and what makes things "popular or relevant"? Twitter will never do this, but other API providers can.</p>
<p>It is up to each API provider to decide how transparent they are going to be with their algorithms. The ideal solution when it comes to transparency is that the algorithm is documented and shared along with supporting&nbsp;code on Github, like <a href="https://github.com/Chicago/food-inspections-evaluation">Chicago, did for their food inspection algorithm</a>. This opens up the algorithm, and the code behind for evaluation by 3rd parties, potentially improving upon it, as well as validating the logic behind--potentially opening up a conversation about the life of the algorithm.</p>
<p>There are a number of common reasons I have seen for companies and developers not opening up their algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>It truly is secret sauce, and too much was invested to just share with the world.</li>
<li>It is crap, and the creator doesn't want anyone to know there is nothing behind.</li>
<li>There are malicious things going on behind the scenes that they do not want to be public.</li>
<li>Insecurities about coding abilities, security practices and logic applied to the algorithms.</li>
<li>Exist in competitive space with lots of bad actors, and may want to limit this behavior.</li>
<li>What is accomplished isn't really that defensible, and the only advantage is to keep hidden.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have no problem making an argument for algorithmic transparency when it comes to regulated industries, like financial, healthcare, and education. I think it should be default in all civic, non-profit, and other similar scenarios where the whole stack should just be open sourced, and available on Github. You won't find me pushing back to hard on the startups unless I see some wild claims about the magic behind, or I see evidence of exploitation, then you will hear me rant about this some more.</p>
<p>Algorithmic transparency can help limit algorithmic exploitation&nbsp;and the other shady shit that is going on behind the scenes on a regular basis these days. <a href="http://apievangelist.com">I have added an algorithm section to my research</a>, and as I see more talk about the magic of algorithms, and how these amazing creations are changing our world--I am going to be poking around a bit, and probably asking to see more algorithmic transparency when I think it makes sense.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://terms-of-service.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-terms-of-use.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I find myself thinking about what the terms of service we agree to for online services are doing to our lives. Whether we see the effects or not, they are guiding almost everything we do in our personal and professional worlds. They are something that began on our desktop computers, migrated to our more mobile laptops, then deeper into our personal lives via our mobile smartphones.</p>
<p>We rarely understand what we are agreeing to when we check the box for these terms of service, which leaves me really surprised to see us accept the application of terms of service to everyday objects we depend on, as part of the Internet of Things movement. As physical objects in our lives get connected to the Internet, they begin to generate valuable data, requiring software to manage--all being directed by the terms of service set forth by the manufacturer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see this playing out as manufacturers like <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/203913-general-motors-john-deere-want-to-keep-tinkering-self-repair-illegal">GM and John Deer are limiting what you can do with their physically connected equipment</a>. These terms of service are changing the meaning of ownership, and evolving te physical things we purchase into subscriptions, instead of outright ownership. Following the tone of the conversation set by terms of service which is guiding software, this new breed of terms of service being applied to physical objects in a way that heavily benefits manufacturers, shifting as much the risk as possible to the consumers, leaving many of the benefits as possible for themselves.</p>
<p>In the rapidly expanding online and mobile worlds we (consumers) have almost no tools that help us manage the terms of service we are agreeing to, and almost no leverage when it comes to how these are crafted, changed, and applied. Why the hell would we keep this rapid pace continuing into the physical world, as well as our online worlds? It just doesn't pencil out? Especially when you consider how we give up so much of our privacy, security, and ownership as in agreeing to these terms of service.</p>
<p>How terms of service are applied to virtual and increasingly physical objects that are being connected to the Internet are much like algorithms, as they are often coded black boxes that we do not always understand. I will keep tracking on them the best I can, but as a community, we need a lot more resources if we are going to shift the balance of all of this more in the favor of the average consumer.</p>

<p>I am working on each portion of this and considering how I can add. I do not see any reason why this can't be applied to other areas of our information, like social, electricity, and beyond. I get that health care information has been granted a special place in our digital worlds, but I think we need to asking ourselves where else this might also apply.</p>
<p>It is tough to digest this in its full legal form. This is why I work to break them down as plain English building blocks that I can include alongside my research. If we can make turn this into an easy to read checklist that any data steward could use as best practices when crafting their own approach tot he disclosure of our information, maybe more companies will step up to the plate.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-science-api.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had heard about the <a href="http://labs.pathology.wisc.edu/oconnor/index.html">Zika virus research</a> that was going on at the&nbsp;University of Wisconsin listening to <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/03/08/469653715/scientists-report-in-real-time-on-challenging-zika-research">an NPR episode this last spring</a>. I finally had the time to dig into the topic a little more, and learn more about where the research is at, and some of the software behind the sharing and collaboration around the research.</p>
<p>The urgency in getting the raw data and results of the research out to the wider scientific community caught my attention and the potential for applying API related approaches seems pretty huge. When it comes to mission-critical&nbsp;research that could impact thousands or millions of people, it seems like there should be a whole suite of open tooling that people can employ to ensure sharing and collaboration are real time and frictionless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I dug into the <a href="https://zika.labkey.com/project/home/begin.view">Zika virus research</a>, I was happy to find the <a href="http://www.labkey.com/">LabKey technology</a> employed to publish the research. I do not know much about them yet, but I was happy to see the <a href="http://www.labkey.com/products-services/labkey-server/download-community-edition/">open source community solution</a>, <a href="https://www.labkey.org/home/Documentation/wiki-page.view?name=dev">developer resources</a> including a <a href="https://www.labkey.org/home/Documentation/wiki-page.view?name=dev">web API for integrating with research that is published using the platform</a>. There are plenty of improvements I'd like to see added to the API and developer efforts, but it is a damn good start when it comes to making important scientific research much more shareable and collaborative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll spend more time learning more about what LabKey currently offers, and then I'll work to establish some sort of next steps blueprint that would employ other modern API approaches to help ensure important research can be&nbsp;made more real-time, aggregated, interoperable, and shareable using technology like <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">definitions</a>, <a href="http://webhooks.apievangelist.com">Webhooks</a>, <a href="http://ipaas.apievangelist.com">iPaaS</a>, and other common areas of a modern API effort.</p>
<p>When it comes to research, scientists should&nbsp;have a wealth of open tooling and resources that make their work a collaborative and shareable process by default, but with as much control as they desire--something modern web API solutions excel at. I added LabKey to a new research area dedicated to science. I will spend more time going through space, and see what guides, blueprints, and other resources I can pull together to assist researchers in their API journey.</p>

<p>I've been <a href="https://integriography.wordpress.com/2016/07/11/doidoe-did-not-ban-dji-products-but/">reading a number of stories about concerns within the Department of Interior about the usage of DJI drones as part of their UAV operations</a>. Whether or not the federal agency actually issued a ban on using the drones is another story, regardless I wanted to extract this concept and apply to the wider world of Internet of Things, in which drones are definitely a poster child for.</p>
<p>In our race to connect devices to the Internet, at the consumer and industrial level, what considerations are being made regarding what data is collected, how this information is transmitted (via which networks), and ultimately where is data being stored (which country). Obviously, this is something the federal government is beginning to think about, but I'm guessing hasn't fully formed an approach to dealing with this problem consistently across agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People love to dismiss individual consumer right to know about their data at this level, as nobody cares enough, but at the corporate, institutional, and agency level we better be taking things a little more seriously. If you are uploading your organizational intelligence unknowingly to servers out of the country, or in jurisdictions where it might be easily shared with your competitors or rival factions--you might want to be thinking about switching providers. ;-)</p>
<p>As platform providers how will we be certifying the chain of custody for the Internet-connected devices we are manufacturing, and within the applications and system they employ? As device consumers, how will we ensure that ALL the devices we are employing are in sync with our organizational mission and governance?&nbsp;</p>
<p>So many interesting questions being asked right now, as we race to wire up our physical world to the Internet...</p>

<p>QuickFacts provides statistics for all states and counties, and for cities and towns with a population of 5,000 or more, and provides everything I think you need to make the case behind any facts and statistics you are presenting.</p>
<p>Using the tool you get a table, chart, map, data download, email results, and share via popular social networks as well as embeddable tooling. The QuickFacts experience should be a default for all storytelling around open data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Census team has clearly worked very hard to make a wealth of very complicated data much more accessible, usable, and easily understood through proven approaches to telling stories using open data.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-algorithmic-transparency.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>API Evangelist is focused on helping push for sensible API-driven transparency wherever I can get it. When done in sensible ways an API can crack open the often black box&nbsp;that is the algorithm,&nbsp;giving us access and more control over our online experience.</p>
<p>One of the most significant algorithmic bottlenecks that govern our daily lives is our mobile data plans. All of our mobile phones are governed at the data plan level--this is where the telecom companies make their money, throttling the bits and bytes we depend on each day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mobile data plan is a great place to discuss the algorithmic and data transparency that APIs can assist with, and one example of this in action is with the <a href="http://youtube-eng.blogspot.com/2016/04/announcing-mobile-data-plan-api.html">Google Mobile Data Plan API</a>. Google wants more access at this level to improve the quality of experience for end-users when using mobile applications like Youtube, which can be severely impacted by data plan limits, while also significantly impacting your data plan consumption if not optimized.</p>
<p>There is so much opportunity for discussion between mobile network operator, API providers, developers, consumers at the data plan level. I know mobile network operators would rather keep this a black box, so they can maximize their revenue, but when you crack the network layer open with a publicly available API, there will be a number of new revenue opportunities.</p>
<p>Data plans affect all of us, every single day. We need more transparency into the algorithms that meter, limit, and charge us at the mobile data plan layer. We need the platforms we depend on each day to have more tools to optimize how applications consume (or do not consume) this extremely (seemingly) finite, and valuable resource (thanks, telcos!).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've added an algorithms area to my research to keep an eye on this topic, curate stories I find, and share my own thoughts when it comes to algorithmic transparency using APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.airmap.com/wildfire-awareness-geofencing-drones/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Wildfire-Screenshot-Web-App-1.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have been spending a lot of time this summer thinking about how devices are being connected to the Internet, specifically when it comes to drones. As I was traveling around the countryside flying drones, I increasingly came across stories about drones being a nuisance, and most notably being a big huge problem for firefighting crews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am flying a DJI Phantom 3 Professional drone, so <a href="http://www.dji.com/newsroom/news/dji-and-airmap-deliver-real-time-wildfire-awareness-and-geofencing-capabilities-for-drones">I was interested to see DJI recently enable real-time geofencing capabilities for drone pilots</a>. If you are unfamiliar with how these drones work, your drone controller is simply an iPad enabled joystick&nbsp;and a mobile application which becomes your control center. Before you can fly the drone the application goes through a whole series of checks making sure all of the drones variety of systems are all in check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These drones are hyper aware of their location, maintaining a very detailed flight and activity log. The new DJI geofencing capabilities will now give you updates on wildfire, military, prison, nuclear power plants and other flight hazards via the DJI GO mobile application. DJI get's its information from <a href="https://www.airmap.com/wildfire-awareness-geofencing-drones/">airspace intelligence company Airmap</a>, who gets their information from <span>Federal Aviation Administration&nbsp;</span><a href="http://tfr.faa.gov/tfr2/list.html">Temporary Flight Restrictions</a><span>&nbsp;(TFR)</span>&nbsp;feed--all driving drone pilot(s) decision on whether it's safe to fly or not.</p>
<p><em>"GEO by default limits flights into or take-off within locations that raise safety or security concerns. If a flight within one of these locations has been authorized, GEO allows users with verified DJI accounts to temporarily unlock or self-authorize their flights. This </em>unlock<em> function is not available for sensitive national-security locations"</em>, according to the DJI Geo system overview. It is interesting to see how this update can be used as an advisory, or something that prevents the operation of a very geo-aware, and&nbsp;Internet-connected device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the part of drone activity I find intriguing. I thoroughly enjoy flying them, but the precedent being set for potentially the future of Internet-connected devices is what I find infinitely more interesting. There are a couple of things at play here that I think are important. The fact that an Internet-connected device has the advisory&nbsp;and kill-switch like this is interesting, but also the fact that a manufacturer (Chinese one) has opted to do this on their own (maybe there is another story behind), and that a federal agency data feed can play a real time role in how devices and their operators are making decisions out in the field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I envision this model being used even more when it comes to federal government regulation of Internet of Things devices, but also within the corporate and institutional governance lifecycle--with devices, and their operators being part of a centralized, API driven, command and control infrastructure. I have a number of stories to work through on this subject, and will keep sharing anything I come across when it comes to direct government connections to the Internet of Things like I am seeing in the drone sector.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/IMG_3539.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am starting the process of getting back to work on API Evangelist, and wrapping up our&nbsp;<a href="http://dronerecovery.org">Drone Recovery</a> project. We will continue working on things throughout the summer, but I need to start looking at what's next for myself, and thanks to the API community, what I'll be doing next with API Evangelist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to the generosity of the API community we were able to stay afloat while spending May through July hiking the hills of Oregon. We are now spending the final months of summer and fall, getting the kid on his feet in Portland, as well as figuring out what our own next steps are. Thankfully we still have an apartment to come back to, and I have API Evangelist domain to work under--I just need to figure out what is next for this production.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were no amazing revelations for me out in the woods. The journey just reinforced how important my work around the technology, business, and politics of APIs is to me. I enjoy paying attention to space and feel that I can continue to contribute by providing analysis that is product and vendor neutral (most of the time).</p>
<p>When it comes to APIs there are several things that keep me interested, and wanting to work on API Evangelist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the people and companies in the community</li>
<li>Some of the technology being applied in API space</li>
<li>Opportunities for collaboration and transparency</li>
<li>Writing, telling my story, as well as story of others</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there are some things that I could do without when doing this work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the people in the community ;-(</li>
<li>The heavy focus on VC investment, acquisitions, and exits</li>
<li>Lack of critical thinking when it comes to applying technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not think I'll make any significant changes to the way API Evangelist operates. I was already limiting my engagement with the companies and people that I feel do not care about the wider community. I will just keep writing and telling stories about what I think matters most when it comes to APIs, and the people, companies, institutions, agencies, and industries they are touching in 2016.</p>
<p>Thanks again to the community, for giving me the breathing room to get back on my feet in a thoughtful way, and not make any drastic decisions&nbsp;about API Evangelist, and how I will keep the lights on. I will begin slowly ramping things up here in August, getting back to my monitoring of the space, and crafting stories on the blog.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I was already doing before things shifted this summer, I will continue to pull back some of my research behind a paywall of industry guides, and other long-form content that will help support my ongoing research. The short form analysis and commentary will remain open, helping provide the regular stream of API banter that people seem to have grown accustomed to. The tone will remain the same, as the short form stories are generated as part of the conversation I have with myself about what I'm seeing in the space, and not about any particular brand, company, or approach (unless it stands out).</p>
<p>There is not much else to say. Thank you again for helping make sure my website was still here when I got back. Thanks for being so understanding when it came to disappearing on our journey this summer. I look forward to the future of API Evangelists--whatever that might look like.</p>

<p>I came out of the wilderness this week (literally, the Kalmiopsis Wilderness) to an inbox full of emails and a Twitter stream full of messages and DMs. I expected a little buzz from my exit, but not to the extent that it did, let alone the direction it took.</p>

<p>I am incredibly humbled by the community's response, and honestly, I'm not well equipped to deal with this type of attention. I know there are some folks out there who think I am some sort of attention seeker, but that is the part of all of this that I really struggle with the most. I have to step aside from myself to be able to write. Otherwise, I'm left incapacitated.</p>

<p>I am incredibly thankful for the API community. I have had the bar set pretty high for this community throughout the last six years, and you managed to raise it beyond what I had already set in my mind. I kindasorta thought some of you were reading my rants, but it kind of terrifies me now how many of you actually were.</p>

<p>Sooooooo....while I received some very fine bids on API Evangelist this week, as well as some pretty creative solutions for keeping alive and generating revenue, <a href="https://www.generosity.com/community-fundraising/the-most-important-api-call-for-kin-lane">I'm going to accept the community's bid for the domain</a>. It will remain the community's API Evangelist voice, as it has 87.34% of the time (I am a sellout, just not very good one) over the last six years -- I will just leave it as is.</p>

<p>The blog and Twitter account will remain dormant, as I will have no time to do any work. If you do have a post which you feel would be "worthy" of publishing to the blog over the summer, feel free to fork, and submit as pull request. When I come out of woods, I'll consider accepting it for publishing. If not, you will have to wait until I get my head back into tech to read anything more.</p>

<p>All the rest of the bids I received for the site, I'll have to decline. Thank you for your kind offers and will try to get everyone a short email response. That's all I got. I have enough money to get through the summer now, pay for gas, food, and the occasional campsite and motel. Oh, and some cool <a href="http://dronerecovery.org">drone equipment</a>! I have no idea what the summer holds, so I can't make any predictions for the fall -- we will see.</p>

<p>I can say, that you should <a href="https://medium.com/@njyx/priority-overflow-991fcf1e2f3#.pyf959fke">take Steve's advice in his blog post</a>, and don't take anything for granted. Especially going to the bathroom in a toilet. Don't take that for granted. It's a wonderful thing!! ;-)&nbsp;</p>
<p>#thankyou</p>

<p>It has been six years since I started API Evangelist. A personal matter has come up which will require my attention for at least six months, probably upwards of a year. Which in the tech world can be centuries--when you are dealing in real time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this in mind, I will be putting the apievangelist.com domain, and @apievangelist Twitter account up for auction. When I come back (if I do), I'm perfectly happy starting over, and I need all the funds I can get to get me through the summer, and API Evangelist is the only asset I own.</p>
<p>I am very sorry for the impact on my business partners, but family and human beings come first, and I'm sure they will be fine. If you want the short and sweet on what I'm doing head over to kinlane.com blog, and <a href="http://dronerecovery.org/journal/drone-recovery/">if you want to follow the story of what I'm up to this summer you can head over to dronerecovery.org</a>.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;apievangelist.com&nbsp;website does over 50K page views monthly with about 30K uniques. The Twitter account has 5K followers, and growing every day--perfect for any API company. I'm taking bids for all of it to fund what I'm doing the next few months. API Evangelist is worth a lot to me, so I'm starting the bidding at 10K, and accepting the highest bidder by May 27th.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Email your bids to kinlane@gmail.com. The entire site runs on Jekyll via Github, so I can just transfer domain, and transfer the organization to you via Github. If the site does not sell, I will just leave up, and contemplate its future at a later date.</p>
<p>Thank you for all your support--it was a fun ride.</p>

<p>API management is the oldest area of my research. The area has been being defined since Mashery first opened its doors in 2006&nbsp;and continues to be defined with the recent IPO by Apigee, and the entry of AWS into the sector with the AWS API Gateway. API management is often defined by the services offered by these companies, but also by the strategies of leading API providers in the space.</p>
<p>My API management research walks through the common building blocks of the space, the open source tooling, and API service providers who are serving the space. I first started this guide in 2010 and 2011 and have worked to evolve with each release, as well as the fast pace change that seems to occur in the space.</p>
<p>This guide touches on, and often overlaps with my other areas of research (as everything was born out of this), but should provide you with what you need as a checklist for evolving your existing API management strategy, or help you craft a brand new one for your new API. This guide has a heavy focus on a service provider led approach to API management, but with the growth in open source solutions lately, I'm working to evolve more towards a DIY approach to making it work.</p>
<p>I fund my research through consulting, selling my guides, and the generous support of my sponsors. I appreciate your support in helping me continue with my work and hope you find it relevant in your API journey.</p>

<p>In the last couple of years, I've seen the concept of API design go from being something the API elite discuss, to something that involves business users, and something that has spawned a whole ecosystem of service and tooling providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This API design research covers the concepts people often associate with API design, like REST, and Hypermedia, but also touches on other media types, API definitions, and many of the services, tooling and other solutions that have emerged to serve the space.</p>

<p>One of the things that stood out for me <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/10/twitter-collection-of-sarahjeong-xor-swiftstories-oracle-vs-google-coverage/">reading through the Oracle v Google trial coverage today</a>&nbsp;was Sarah Jeong's acknowledging how APIs are kind of hard to understand, and is something that is casting a shadow over the case -- something that is probably my top concern.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The whole thing where APIs are kind of hard to understand &mdash; still casting a shadow over this case</p>
&mdash; sarah jeong (@sarahjeong) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong/status/730118634828259328">May 10, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>Also pointing out what I think is true of the Oracle legal team:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I am not entirely sure this Oracle lawyer understands what an API is, I'm not entirely sure I understand what an API is</p>
&mdash; sarah jeong (@sarahjeong) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong/status/730120248762863617">May 10, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>While this might be more about bringing things down to a lower level for "normals", I think it still represents how difficult it is for people to grok what APIs are:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">jfc I think both sides have brought LITERAL PHYSICAL FILE CABINETS as visual aids to explain what a API is</p>
&mdash; sarah jeong (@sarahjeong) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong/status/730079061293195264">May 10, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>Then continuing with more of the skeuomorph theater:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Google's has a big 8.5x11 printout propped up on it labeled "java.lang" and the top drawer is labeled "Math" in very big Arial Black letters</p>
&mdash; sarah jeong (@sarahjeong) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong/status/730079299353485313">May 10, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>Then I guess we need to make some API calls? IDK</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">he literally opened the top drawer and pulled something out and waved it around to explain</p>
&mdash; sarah jeong (@sarahjeong) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong/status/730079435806801920">May 10, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>None of which I think is helping anyone involved:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">at this point, I am not entirely sure APIs are real</p>
&mdash; sarah jeong (@sarahjeong) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong/status/730120312772157440">May 10, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>I agree with with Sarah. She's a super smart chick, and if all the theater is confusing her, I can only imagine what effect it will have on the jury. What is code, what is API, what is definition, and what actually runs, or is there to enable and facilitate&nbsp;interoperability&nbsp;is blurry when you are in the game--I cannot even image anymore what it is like for the normals.</p>
<p>The only thing that keeps me optimistic in all of this is the possibility for some API literacy lessons for the masses, amidst all the theater. I guess we have to see how it goes&nbsp;and hope there are more opportunities to help folks understand what APIs actually are.</p>

<p>I am&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/facas/sites/faca/files/SingleSourceofTruth-APITFRecommendations.pdf">reading through the API task force recommendations</a>&nbsp;out of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), to help address privacy and security concerns around mandated API usage as part of the Common Clinical Data Set, Medicare, and Medicaid Electronic Health Records. The recommendations contain a wealth of valuable insights around healthcare APIs but&nbsp;are&nbsp;also full of patterns that we should be applying across other sectors of our society where APIs making an impact. To help me work through the task force's recommendations, I will be blogging through many of the different concepts at play</p>
<p>In addition to highlighting&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/10/the-concept-of-patientdirected-apis/">the usage of "patient-directed&nbsp;APIs" that I wrote about earlier</a>, and taking <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/10/a-healthy-stance-on-privacy-and-security-when-it-comes-to-healthcare-apis/">a healthy stance on privacy and security when it comes to healthcare APIs</a>, I wanted to separate out the conversation around a patent's right to access their own personal health information, and how APIs are being used as the enabler. Here is the chapter from the task force's recommendations:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Many of the discussions within the task force centered around the notion that the patient directed app of our purview supports the patient&rsquo;s HIPAA right to access his/her own PHI from a Covered Entity, as required under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.502">HIPAA &sect; 164.502</a>. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This could be characterized in several ways:</em></p>
<ol style="padding-left: 20px;">
<li><em>the individual requesting access to their information</em></li>
<li><em>an entity designated by the individual to receive a copy of PHI (as part of the individual exercising his/her right to access PHI)</em></li>
<li><em>the medium on which the individual requests that PHI be provided or transmitted as part of the individual exercising his/her right to obtain a copy of PHI</em></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> Alternatively, the patient directed app may also be characterized as a third party formerly authorized by the individual to receive PHI or a tool for engaging the individual in treatmentEach of these scenarios creates challenges when attempting to determine oversight of an app&rsquo;s behavior there is not one clear solution.</em></p>
<p>I am going to educate myself about <em><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.502">HIPAA &sect; 164.502</a></em>, and get to work understanding what other precedents exist--maybe with <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">FERPA</a> or <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions">COPPA</a>, or other similarly regulated industries. I am just looking to understand where the lines are drawn when it comes to people having a "right to access" when it comes to their data, especially when APIs are playing a central role like they are with healthcare interoperability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have read the healthcare API task force recommendations several times now, but I am only a couple pages into when it comes to cherry picking ideas I want to consider more deeply, as well as have indexed as part of my overall API industry research. So stay tuned for continued posts about how APIs are being used to drive patient-centered&nbsp;access to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">their</span> healthcare data.</p>

<p>The next round of the Oracle v Google Java API Copyright battle has kicked off again in San Francisco after being sent back to the lower court by the United States Supreme Court. This round is all about deciding if Google's usage of the Java API in their Android platform was allowed under fair use. If I was in San Francisco I would be there to hear the case first hand--I am lucky there are some really smart folks covering the case&nbsp;and live tweeting things.</p>
<p>I went through the Tweets from&nbsp;Sarah Jeong (<a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong">@sarahjeong</a>), contributing editor at @Motherboard, Parker Higgins (<a href="https://twitter.com/xor">@xor</a>), EFF activist, and Mike Swift (<a href="https://twitter.com/Swiftstories">@Swiftstories</a>), Senior Correspondent for MLex. They are all providing some smart, and pretty amusing commentary on what is going on, so I wanted to organize the relevant Tweets into a Twitter collection summary for inclusion in my research.&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center" style="width: 60%; border: 0px solid #000; margin-left: 135px;">
  <a class="twitter-timeline" href="https://twitter.com/kinlane/timelines/730194899920932864" data-widget-id="730232433828724736">Oracle v Google </a>

</div>
<p>I will add more tweets to it each day of the trial, and since it's a Twitter collection, it will update here on the blog post, or if you'd rather,<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane/timelines/730194899920932864">you can access it directly&nbsp;via Twitte</a>r. I have no idea how long this round of the case will play out, but I will definitely be tuning in, and ranting about it when I have time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if there is anyone else covering the trial, that I should be including in the Twitter collection. I want to try and capture as complete of a record as possible, from multiple perspectives if possible. While I am bummed that the precedent for copyright has been established for APIs, I'm hopeful that we can look at this round as an API literacy opportunity. ;-)</p>

To help me work through the task force's recommendations, I will be blogging through many of the different concepts at play.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One phrase that is used regularly across the task force recommendations that really caught my attention was the concept of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>"PatientDirected APIs"</em></strong></span>. It is a powerful concept, when you think about APIs existing, not just for helping integrate healthcare systems, and innovate around the development and delivery of the web and mobile applications, but doing it all because of, in service of, and at the direction of the patient. The document has grabbed my attention because this is the first time I've seen such an end-user focused API vision in the wild.</span></p>
<p><span>While these electronic healthcare record APIs will be used for system integration, delivering web and mobile apps, and benefiting healthcare platform operators, and developers, the reason for the APIs will be existing is to benefit the patient. This just isn't how things are done in Silicon Valley, where you always focus on benefits for the platform, its partners and investors first, maybe the developers secondarily, but in most cases the end-user is just an afterthought. In startup culture, things are just turned on its head, allowing for some serious imbalance in how we do things with APIs.</span></p>
<p><span>There are a wealth of topics for me to work through from the task force recommendations out of ONC and HHS. I will keep blogging, as I read through, and work through the important recommendations it contains. Once I have my head wrapped around the document more, and up to speed with&nbsp;what they are doing, I'm hoping I can contribute some more ideas that might help stimulate things as healthcare providers roll out their APIs.</span></p>

<p>How we define our APIs has dramatically changed in recent years. Since Swagger came onto the scene around five years ago, there has been a rapid growth in the number of open formats, tooling, and services to help us define APIs. Companies are using API definitions like OpenAPI Spec, Postman, and API.json to communicate about their APIs at almost every stop along the API life cycle. This is my research to better understand all the moving parts in this fast growing sector.</p>
<p><a href="http://apis.how/oq38yeqkkd">This guide</a> focuses on API definition formats like OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint, as well as schema formats like JSON Schema, and MSON, but I also touch on media types, link relations and other common building blocks for defining our APIs so they speak a common language. While there is some open tooling included in this guide, I'm trying to focus on the specifications, and formats themselves, and help make sense of the amount of information available to us.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 May 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-smoke-and-mirrors.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I get brought into a lot of API discussions with IT departments from companies, institutions, and government agencies, which are often coordinated by business groups who are interested in better meeting their goals using APIs. This is often an immediately charged conversation, with IT coming to their table with a whole array of baggage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In about 75% of the situations, IT, and developer representatives are nice, or rather they are tight-lipped, relying on a myriad of smoke &amp; mirrors to defend their dark arts. Let me stop for a moment, and put out there that I was IT director from 1998 through 2010. I'm not saying IT are bad people, but there are a wide variety of ways we slow, obfuscate, and distort the conversation to be in our favor -- takes one to know one. I wouldn't say that I was 100% honest in my approach to being an IT leader, but I tried my hardest to keep things as transparent as I possibly could.</p>
<p>Anyways, in a couple of the &nbsp;IT discussions I've had lately, there was an OpenAPI Spec available to define the resources that were on the table, and in a handful of other conversation there were not. Keep in mind that most of these scenarios are with a more traditional version of IT, not with startup technology groups (a whole different beast). As I step back, I am taking notice of the harmonizing effect that an API definition can have, in keeping conversations focused, productive, and moving forward toward a common goal.</p>
<p>In the conversations without an OpenAPI Spec, back-end systems and legacy processes dominated the discussion, even though we are all on a conference call to discuss an external, partner, and public facing API. In the discussions where an OpenAPI Spec was present, we focused on exactly which resources were needed (nothing more), and the details (params, responses, etc) that were needed by all consumers--essentially providing us with a scaffolding for the discussion, that kept things moving forward, and not bogged down in legacy sludge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backend focused discussions&nbsp;always seemed to get slowed down by what was, and what is. The API definition focused conversations seemed to focus on what was needed, using a common language that everyone at the table understood. The presence of an OpenAPI Spec seemed to cut through the smoke &amp; mirrors, which I think often alienates many of the business users. I find having three versions of an OpenAPI Spec and APIs.json file present: 1) simple outline 2) YAML and 3) JSON, was also something that significantly improved discussions, keeping conversations focused while also making them as inclusive as possible.</p>
<p>I think people will always bring their baggage to these discussions, but I'm liking the harmonization effects API definitions like OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, Postman, and APIs.json are having in&nbsp;these conversations. I'm hopeful that these API definitions can continue providing bridges between business and IT groups, helping close a canyon that has existed for decades.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 May 2016</span>

<p>I am <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/facas/sites/faca/files/SingleSourceofTruth-APITFRecommendations.pdf">reading through the API task force recommendations</a> out of t<span>he Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), to help address privacy and security concerns around mandated API usage as part of the Common Clinical Data Set, Medicare, and Medicaid Electronic Health Records. The recommendations contain a wealth of valuable insights around healthcare APIs but&nbsp;are&nbsp;also full of patterns that we should be applying across other sectors of our society where APIs making an impact. To help me work through the task force's recommendations, I will be blogging through many of the different concepts at play.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/10/the-concept-of-patientdirected-apis/">Beyond the usage of "patient-directed&nbsp;APIs" that I wrote about earlier</a>, I thought the pragmatic view on API privacy and security was worth noting. When it comes to making data, content, and other digital resources available online, I hear the full spectrum of concerns, and it leaves me optimistic to hear government agencies speak about security and privacy in such a balanced way.</p>
<p>Here is a section from the API task force recommendations:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Like any technology, APIs allow new capabilities and opportunities and, like any other technology, these opportunities come with some risks. There are fears that APIs may open new security vulnerabilities, with apps accessing patient records "for evil", and without receiving proper patient authorization. There are also fears that APIs could provide a possible "fire hose" of data as opposed to the "one sip at a time" access that a web site or email interface may provide.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In testimony, we heard almost universally that, when APIs are appropriately managed, the opportunities outweigh the risks. We heard from companies currently offering APIs that properly managed APIs provide better security properties than ad-hoc interfaces or proprietary integration technology.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">While access to health data via APIs does require additional considerations and regulatory compliance needs, we believe existing standards, infrastructure, and identity proofing processes are adequate to support patient directed access via APIs today.</p>
<p>The document is full of recommendations on how to strike this balance. It is refreshing to hear such a transparent vision of what APIs can be. They weigh the risks, alongside the benefits that APIs bring to the table&nbsp;while also being fully aware that a "properly managed API" provides its own security. Another significant aspect of these recommendations for me is that they also touch on the role that APIs will play in the regulatory and a compliance process.</p>
<p>I have to&nbsp;admit, the area of healthcare APIs isn't one of the most exciting stacks in the over 50 areas I track on across the API space, but I'm fully engaged with this because of the potential of a blueprint for privacy and security that can be applied with other types of APIs. When it comes to social, location, and other data the bar has been set pretty low when it comes to privacy and security, but health care&nbsp;data is different. People tend to be more concerned with access, security, privacy, and all the things we should already be discussing when it comes to the rest of our digital existence--opening the door for some valuable digital literacy discussions.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I don't run you off with all my healthcare API stories, and you can find some gems in the healthcare API task force's recommendations, like I am.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/07/twilio-provides-test-api-credentials-with-magic-phone-numbers/">I wrote a post about Twilio using magic phone numbers that let their developers test out functionality without incurring any charges for deploying live phone numbers, making calls, and sending SMS</a>. After publishing my post, Runscope CEO, John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) said he was behind the original spec for the Twilio magic numbers.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> ha I wrote the magic numbers spec. The implementation was better than my design but it&rsquo;s funny to see it recognized so much later</p>

<p>John&nbsp;continued to share some of the logic that went into his original spec:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> I borrowed the idea from payment processors using magic numbers to generate specific kinds of outcomes like declines</p>

<p>Which I think adds another dimension to the concept of having test numbers like this. Different numbers give you different outcomes, and different credit card numbers give you different results. What else could you do with test numbers&nbsp;and unique identifiers? Existing invoice and order numbers for different commerce situations. Seems like you could load just about anything into any alpha and / or numeric that you would want to.</p>
<p>Around the turn of the century (I don't think I've ever said that) I used to work on web applications for non-profit organizations where I used to build campaign code tracking for large, and lengthy mail, phone, fax, and other types of activities. We had 6 to 8 digit identifiers, which every two digits had unique meanings--allowing us to build a pretty robust set of scenarios that helped us track every step in the campaigns evolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, I think the concept is worthy of further exploration. I could see API providers crafting a pretty robust set of keys that could represent almost any object served up as part of API operations, with a very structured approach for how you tailor a multitude outcomes involving these objects. For me, this type of stuff goes way beyond just having a sandbox for your API, and could provide a much more meaningful way help developers polish their integrations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 May 2016</span>

<p>As I push out stories on the next round of the Oracle v Google API copyright case, considering how I will write about API deprecations and acquisitions I'm privy to, and document the continued march by the enterprise into the world of APIs -- I begin to see how APIs will continue to wither on the vine, and never reach their full potential in an increasingly&nbsp;toxic&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>The Oracle v Google is just the first of many battles to occur between tech giants when it comes to APIs&nbsp;and the application of intellectual property laws. With the number of patents out there that focus on APIs as the thing that is protected by IP, not just the thing behind the API being protected, the copyright of the common API patterns&nbsp;we enjoy&nbsp;will just be the tip of the iceberg. This is how the giants will battle it out, leaving the rest of us fighting for scraps in the cracks.</p>
<p>Legal tussle like what we see between Oracle&nbsp;and Google will become commonplace in the future as the enterprise&nbsp;fights for what they think is their&nbsp;"property" when it comes to integrations, collaboration, sharing, and automation. These battles will take place after this current wave of "interest in APIs" by the enterprise, where these large entities have sent their scouts out to map this uncharted (and mildly threatening) wilderness, understand what everyone is doing, and file patents based on what they see. Simplifying enterprise operations, actually innovating, or truly achieving integration is&nbsp;farthest from their mind. While we are all busy doing the work, these IP cartographers are mapping out the exhaust from our labor.</p>
<p>Alongside all of this, another shift in the winds is occurring, that will reduce some very useful, innovative, and valuable API patterns to just portfolio items of the enterprise. As VC funding cycles shift, the startups who are doing the most interesting things with APIs will have their work gobbled up by the enterprise, either through direct acquisitions, or fire sales -- in any case APIs are IP, nothing more. These winds are strong, and will not just blow away the valuable APIs, but also much of the shade trees that is needed for other APIs to flourish on the vine.</p>
<p>All of this change will sweep up this API experiment&nbsp;as we know it, into the IP portfolios of the enterprise giants, so they can use as leverage in court battles, and venture negotiations of the future. The enablement that APIs bring to the table is just too small of a thing currently for the enterprise to even see. Startups are often too greedy, or beholden to their investors to understand the opportunity they are passing on&nbsp;when they see APIs as intellectual property. API enablement is not IP, the thing they enable is IP, and by freezing up the enabling factor, you will miss out on your IP ever reaching full potential, and will be left with a vineyard of perpetually green grapes.</p>
<p>I know, I know. All my enterprise and startup friends will tell me how naive I am, and this is how business is done. Again, I will say, you are so blinded by your greed, and your belief in this broken IP systems, you are willing to kill off this very interesting experiment--where we all &nbsp;had a seat at the table. At this point, I am left without any hope, and the concept of APIs as we know it will wither on the vine, never reaching their full potential -- this API economy thing we all saw in our minds eye, will not happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm gonna still keep on fighting, and pushing for APIs usage in healthcare, education, government, and other important areas. I will keep building services and tools that embrace APIs as their core, but you will rarely hear me speak of the bright, API enabled future anymore. The experiment is over, the believers in a broken IP system are winning -- they just have too much money, and resources to play the long game, and the wider API space, and the rest of us will lose out.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 May 2016</span>
        <p>I'm spending a lot of time in the Twilio API ecosystem this week, so you will hear multiple stories about what they are up to. This one is highlighting their <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/call-feedback">Call Feedback API</a> and the growing amount of what I'd consider as infrastructure APIs from leading API platforms. The more API platforms mature, the more I see APIs deployed to assist API consumers manage their integrations, as well as get a the core API resources being made available.</p>
<p>Twilio's feedback API focuses on a single API resource, a call, but could just as easily be applied equally as a quality of service feedback endpoint for anything you are serving up, like video, bot responses, recommendations, and beyond. I like the idea of having one endpoint for serving up a resource, and another endpoint for reporting the quality of service around the resource.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/twilio-call-feedback-api.png" alt="" width="98%" /></p>
<p>Now that I have filed a report on Twilio's approach to using APIs as part of their platform operations, I will be keeping a closer eye out for other platforms doing similar things. I will consider adding it to my stack of existing API infrastructure APIs, alongside access to account, application, billing, and analytics via an API.</p>
<p>As the growth of API integration continues, I will continue looking at the API pioneers for examples of how we can be providing more infrastructure focused API resources, that allow API consumers to manage, orchestrate, and automate their API integrations. As developers use a larger number of APIs to drive any single application or system integration, the need to automate accounts, apps, pricing, billing, analytics and feedback loops is only going to grow.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 May 2016</span>
        <p>One thing I look at closely when I review API platforms&nbsp;is how they approach the monetization of their API resources, and the resulting plans, pricing, and access tiers. How platforms think about, and present this aspect of their operations provide a wealth of insights into what a company's motivations are behind their API operations.</p>
<p>I found the approach by <a href="https://i.materialise.com/api/docs/upload-model-api/">3D printing API platform i.materialise</a>&nbsp;to be an interesting approach which goes beyond just charging for API access and focuses on helping API consumers align their business model with i.materialises. i.materialise presents API consumers with two possible routes, with the first being referral based, and the second being a deeper, white label relationship.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/imaterialise-business-models.png" alt="" width="95%" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://i.materialise.com/api/">i.materialise API provides consumers with access to a &nbsp;full stack of 3D printing APIs</a>, allowing you to upload your model, determine what it will cost to print, all the way to assisting you with order fulfillment, delivery, and invoicing. The i.materialise approach to API monetization is different than other APIs I talk about because it's not about paying for API access. In this situation, it's about providing API access to the manufacturing life cycle -- one that is 3D printer driven.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I think utility-based, pay as you go API pricing represent the majority of how we approach API consumption at the moment, I think having your business model aligned, and focused on existing, tangible products and services holds a huge amount of untapped potential for APIs. I'm thinking there are endless numbers of small business out there who would benefit from the process of mapping out their product supply chain&nbsp;and service lifecycles, then the opening up of things as a simple web API--even if it is just for internal, and trusted partner use.</p>

        <p>I am always on the hunt for the little things that make API integration easier, and while <a href="http://theapistack.com/certifying/">working to certify my Twilio API definition</a>, I noticed their <a href="https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/dev-tools/test-credentials">test credentials</a>. When you are playing with the Twilio API, it's pretty easy to add new keys, and create new apps, but they also offering test credentials along with what they call "Twilio's Magic Numbers" so that you can play without connecting to real phones or making actual charges on your account.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/twilio-test-credentials.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Many APIs provide you access to data or content, but Twilio enters the additional realm of much more complex, programmatic API resources. When getting up and going with these types of APIs, it really helps to have a sandbox to play in, and a ready to go set of test credentials provides this for users by default.</p>
<p>If you are offering up more than just data and content, via your API, you may want to follow Twilio's lead, and create a set of permanent, or even regularly changing set of test accounts for consumers to use. It made my onboarding with Twilio, significantly easier.</p>

<p>I am sure there is some equation we could come up to describe the amount of ideology and / or dogma present alongside each bit and byte of code. Something that exponentially increases with each additional line of code or MB on disk. An example of this in action, in the wilds of the API space, is the difference between an SDK for an API, and just a single sample API call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The single API sample is the minimum viable artifact that enables you to get value from an API -- allowing you to make a single API request and receive a single API response. Very little ideology, or dogma present (its there, but just smaller quantities). Now, if an API provider provides you with a Laravel SDK in PHP, or a JAX-RS SDK in Java, and React.js SDK, I'm significantly cranking up the volume on ideology&nbsp;and dogma involved with this code. All contributing what type of technical debt I'm willing to assume along the way, with each of one my API integrations, and wider technological solutions.</p>
<p>I work hard to never hold up any single technology as an absolute solution, as there are none, but I can see a potential for the latest wave of "serverless" approaches to delivering code potentially helping us unwind some of our technical debt. Like most other areas of technology, simply choosing to go "serverless" will not provide you the relief you need, but if you are willing to do the hard work to decouple your existing code, and apply the philosophy consistently to future projects, the chances "serverless" might pay dividends in the reduction of your technical debt will increase greatly.</p>

<p>I am doing way more work on the creation of machine-readable OpenAPI Specs for APIs, indexed using machine-readable APIs.json&nbsp;files than I am the actual creation of APIs lately. About <a href="http://theapistack.com/">half of the API definitions I create are for existing APIs</a>, with <a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/">the rest of them describing APIs that should exist</a>. With the existing APIs, in some cases, I am creating client-side code, but mostly just focusing on a well crafted API definition. When it comes to the new API designs, I am focusing on a complete API definition, but also crafting both server-side, as well as client-side code around the definition--when needed.</p>
<p>Even when I do craft server or client code for an API definition, the value of the code is significantly lower than the definition(s). In my mind the code is disposable. I want to be able to throw it away, and start over with anything I am building, at any point. While I have made significant ideological investments into using Linux for my OS, AWS for my compute and storage hosting, MySQL for my database, and PHP + Slim for my API deployment framework, the code that operates within this framework has to be transient. Some code might end up having a long, long life, but if a piece of code isn't generating value, and in the way, I want to either get rid of it or rewrite it to better meet the requirements.</p>
<p>When it comes to delivering technology in my world, my investments are increasingly in the API definitions, underlying data schemas, and the data and content that is actually stored and transmitted within. The PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML is valuable, but a second class citizen to the JSON, and YAML representations of my APIs, schemas, and the valuable data and content stored. For me personally, having made significant investments in a variety of tech solutions historically, this provides me with the flexibility I need to live in the current online climate. This is something that only has been coming into focus in the last year, so I assume it will also continue to evolve in focus over the next couple of years, but I am already seeing significant returns from my investing in definitions over the code when it comes to my API strategy.</p>

<p>There are many different ways to actually deploy an API. If you are a larger, more established company, you probably have existing&nbsp;tools, services, and processes set forth by IT for deploying APIs. If you are a startup, your developers probably have their own frameworks, or possibly a cloud service they prefer using. <a href="http://apis.how/luztdufwj0">This guide looks to map out the world of API deployment</a>, and some of the common ways companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are deploying APIs in 2016.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://apis.how/luztdufwj0">API deployment guide</a> breaks out many of the common companies, and tools while also looking to identify some of the common building blocks employed by leading providers, in support of API deployment across organizations of all shapes and sizes.

<p>I work to update my guides regularly, and if purchase a copy, you'll get any updates to it for the next year. Every reader of API Evangelist guides helps support this research and enables the work to continue--thank you!</p>

<p>I have been tracking on <a href="http://university.stack.network/">how APIs are used in higher education</a> for some time now, keeping an eye on almost <a href="http://university.stack.network/universities/">50 campus API related efforts</a>. I have my <a href="http://apis.how/qxhdqghp4a">University API guide</a>&nbsp;that I regularly update, but I was eager to push forward my storytelling around what is going on, so I have been working on some papers telling the story behind some of the top higher ed API implementations which I have access to.</p>
<p>What better way to kick this off, than to showcase my favorite campus API group, over at <a href="https://home.byu.edu/home/">Brigham Young University (BYU)</a>. The team led by CIO Kelly Flanagan (<a href="https://twitter.com/kelflanagan">@kelflanagan</a>) have embraced APIs on campus in a way that keeps my excited about APIs, and what is possible. In my opinion, BYU isn't just using APIs to shift IT strategy at the school, they are using APIs to shift how their students and faculty see technology, and put it to work on their terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm pretty familiar with what has been happening at BYU when it comes to APIs, as I see Kelly and his team regularly, but I jumped on a Google Hangout with them, so that I could get the latest. The results is a short five page essay, about the history of the API efforts on campus, some of the benefits to faculty and students, and a glimpse at the future of APIs at the school.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apis.how/adazaak60a">The paper is freely available for you to download as PDF</a>, but I will also be working on some stories that I used&nbsp; the paper, as part of my regularly blogging here on API Evangelist. I want to keep bringing attention to what they are up to at BYU, but also generate attention at other schools about what is possible when it comes to APis. As I note in the paper, I'm also working with Davidson College in North Carolina, and will be working to keep spreading the conversation to other schools.</p>
<p>You can find me speaking at University of California in San Diego this June, so stay tuned for more information about how APIs are used in higher ed this summer--showcasing my conversations with BYU, Davidson, and UCSD, as examples of how APIs are making an impact in higher education.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 May 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://theapistack.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-stacks.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am always working as hard as I can to develop as complete as possible OpenAPI Specs for the APIs that I monitor. I call this <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack research</a>. When possible, in addition to mapping out API operations for an API using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, I also work to create a machine readable OpenAPI Spec for each API.</p>
<p>In most cases I only have the time to profile the surface area of an API -- the host, base url, all properties, and required parameters. I don't always have time to reach what I'd consider to be a complete API definition. This is something that takes authenticating, achieving a successful request and response for each endpoint present, then generating JSON schema for each response -- this takes a significant amount of effort to do properly.</p>
<p>Thankfully in addition to investing in this work myself, I am also getting the assistance of my partners like&nbsp;<a href="http://apis.how/bgdteovduo">Dream Factory</a>, who are interested in getting specific API definitions completed, and make sure they have complete API definitions for the leading APIs out there today. Here are a handful of them I'm working on producing this week:</p>

</table>
<p>I've assigned each API its own Github repo to store the OpenAPI Specs, as well as indexing them using APIs.json, and facilitating the conversation using the Github issues. My goal is to streamline the process of making sure all the endpoints are represented, and a complete definition for both the request and the response exists--while keeping an eye on the future, in a potentially crowd sourced, Github-centric way.</p>
<p>If there is an API you'd like to see get completed, let me know. I am happy to prioritize other APIs after this. My goals it to focus a dedicated amount of time each week to this, but unfortunately this takes money, so I'm looking to get investment from partners, and the general community to help make sure happens. If you want to help, feel free to ping me, and let me know what you need.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/02/http-header-awareness-using-the-link-header-for-pagination/">I was learning more about using the Link header for pagination yesterday</a>, as part of<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/"> my work on the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a>, and this approach to putting hypermedia links in the header got me thinking about other possibilities. Part of the reason I was considering using the Link header for pagination on this particular project was that I was looking to alter the existing schema as little as possible -- I liked that I could augment the response with links, using the header.</p>
<p>Another side thought I had along the way were around the possibilities for using it to augment 3rd party APIs, and APIs from an external vantage point. It wouldn't be too hard route API requests through a proxy, which could add a header with a personalized set of links tailored for each API request. If the request was looking up flights, the links could be to value add services that might influence the decision like links to hotels, events, and other activities. If you were looking up the definition of a word, the links could be to synonyms--endless possibilities.</p>
<p>You wouldn't have to just use it for pagination, and other common link relations, you could make it more about discovery, search, or even serendipity injected from outside sources. Anyways, I think the fact that you can augment an existing response using a header opens up a lot of possibilities for adding hypermedia behaviors to existing APIs. It might also be an interesting way to introduce existing API owners to hypermedia concepts, by showing them the value that can be added when you provided valuable links.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack</a> work gets more attention, folks are reaching out to me to see if I have done certain APIs, or see if I'd prioritize some of the ones already on the list. One thing I'm also noticing is that people are often looking for the JSON schema of each of the API responses, just as much as they are looking for the OpenAPI Spec for the API surface area.</p>
<p>I had someone looking for the <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">complete schema for the Reddit API</a> today, while I was&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/02/working-to-establish-a-complete-openapi-spec-for-leading-apis/">working to authenticate, and record the responses to each endpoint for&nbsp;AngelList, AlchemyAPI, CenturyLink, NTT Docomo, Stripe, Twilio, and Verizon</a>. An OpenAPI Spec for the request structure of an API will get you a long ways in on boarding and learning about an API, but you will need the schema to complete any integration.</p>
<p>This is one of the reason I'm working to establish a better process for certifying that an OpenAPI Spec is complete, because without the definitions, providing a JSON schema, will only get you part way--still so much work to be done. This is why API service providers are looking to have it defined, because a complete spec is what will be used to map to other systems, tools, and services.</p>
<p><a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/">After spending a couple days going through Schema.org</a>, and working on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a>, I'm feeling the gravity of having common, machine readable schema available for the industry to work from. I've spent a number of cycles in the last two years creating OpenAPI Specs for APIs, but often stopping short of requiring the JSON schema to be present. From here forward, I will equally prioritize the response schema --it is proving to be just as valuable as the response described using OpenAPI Spec.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 May 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/github-link-header.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was revisiting the concept of pagination for a specific project I am working, and after consulting my API research, I came up with a suitable approach using a Link Header. Beyond applying this in my specific project, I thought the usage of the header for pagination would be a suitable topic for helping with HTTP header awareness -- a topic I will be writing about regularly, to help folks be more aware of useful approaches to using HTTP headers.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination">Github has the best example of using the link header for pagination that I could find</a>. Github uses the&nbsp;Link response header to hold a handful of Hypermedia link relations including next, last, first, and prev. Providing a nice way to handle not just pagination, but potentially any other related action you might want to take around an API response. It also provides a way to augment link relations to any existing API design, without adding to the actual response body -- which is one reason I decided to use it for my existing project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTTP headers are a critical aspect of API integration, and an area that I feel many developers are lacking awareness of. Which is why I will be working harder to write up simple uses like Link header for pagination, that can help API providers, as well as API consumers better use common HTTP header patterns. To be clear, the Link header is not unique to Github, and is something that is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#page-6">articulated in RFC 5988 for web linking</a>. Something I will add as a tooling to my API design research, so it can be considered as part of an overall <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design toolbox</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Apr 2016</span>
        <p>I was playing with <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/catalog/">Microsoft's API Catalog</a>, a tool to visualize and analyze the API overlap between standards specifications and type systems within browsers, and their footer caught my eye. I am always looking for quality examples of companies doing platform communications and support well, and I think their layout, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">available building blocks</a> in their footer, is worthy of showcasing.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/catalog/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-monitoring-microsoft.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>For me, these numbers, and the available communication and support building blocks, send the right signals--that a platform is alive and active. These are the data points I tune into, to understand how well a platform is doing, or not doing. There are no absolutes when it comes to this type of monitoring, as anything can be gamed, but sign Github activity, road map evolution, and blog storytelling can provide a vital heartbeat for any healthy API platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are picking up speed with the planning for <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/">@APIStrat in Boston this November</a>, and with the <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/program-committee/">event committee assembled</a>, and the <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/call-for-talks/">call for talks open</a>, we are looking at what the possible topics are for sessions. We have seeded the list with the usual suspects like API design, management, testing, monitoring, and others, but we want to also consider what the alternative topics are, and what is relevant to the API sector in 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is most important to you in 2016? Is it the trendier topics like bots, voice, and IoT? Is it more practical things like evangelism, versioning, and discovery? Is it the technical, business, or politics of APIs that are impacting your operations most in 2016? If you want to come and present on it, <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/call-for-talks/">make sure you submit your talk by May 20th</a>. Otherwise you are welcome to <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">tweet at us</a>, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0e6f7e677d7a7c6f7a4e3d7d6d6f626b20606b7a">email at us</a>, write a blog post, commit to a Github repo, or any other way you desire--we'll add into the mix, for the event committee to review.</p>
<p>It is a lot of work to make sure @APIStrat keeps reflecting the wider API movement after 3 years, and we depend on you keeping us informed. I'm enjoying the fact that we are only doing one event this year, as it is giving us more lead time to engage in discussions with the community, and continue making it an inclusive event. Another thing I'd like to hear about from y'all, is what is relevant to Boston, something I'm sure I will learn more about as I continue my profiling of Boston area businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The relationship between API provider and consumer is a fragile one. As an API provider I am offering up my valuable digital asset, data, content, and digital resources. I would like you to take this Application Programming Interface or SDK that I have built, and put it in your business systems and applications. As an API consumer, I'm given access to valuable business API asset, which I'm expected use in a respectful way, that is always in alignment with a providers terms of service -- an environment where so much can go wrong, and does each day.</p>
<p>I watch companies take a wide range of tones when it comes to setting the stage for this relationship. Some companies are super protective of their valuable content (like Marvel Comics), some are very communicative and inviting like Slack (inject your bot into us). where others wobble between a more open, the back to strict, like Twitter has done over the last couple years. In my opinion, it comes down to how you see your digital resources, and your belief in intellectual property -- when I you, I mean you and your investors.</p>
<p>I try NOT to read all the patent notifications that come into my reader, as it fucking depresses me, but everyone once in a while I have to revisit to help remind everyone, what an illness patents will be, when it comes to APIs working. This fragile relationship I speak of above, operates well, or not very well, depending on how loose, or how much friction exists at this layer. There are plenty of examples out there of APIs who do not do well when they restrict, or too heavily meter API consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help build an image in your mind. Imagine the Twitter API, and all the apps that have been built on it. OK, now add in Stripe for payments, Dropbox for storage, Instagram for Images, Facebook for Social, Amazon EC2 for compute, and YouTube for videos. Now, think about enforcing copyright on every API design, and patent licensing on each process involved. It will grind these billion dollar revenue engines to a screeching halt. Nobody will build on these platforms if they have to bake your legal heavy design, and process into their business.</p>
<p>Modern web APIs are balance between the technical, business, and politics of how data, content, and algorithms are exchanged. Simple, ubiquitous web technology is working on the technical side of things. Simple, pay as you go, utility based, and tiered access is helping strike balance on the business side of things. TOS, privacy, security, transparency are the knobs and dials of the political side of things, let's not willingly invite in something so invasive, like patents into the API layer. Patent your algorithm, copyright your content, and license your data, but keep the API definition copyright free, and your API process patent free.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=9,280,678.PN.&amp;OS=PN/9,280,678&amp;RS=PN/9,280,678">"secure cloud storage distribution and aggregation"</a> patent I'm reading this morning, its not the patent that offends me. It is the patent being so focused on the API being the thing that makes the patent. Patent how you index, search, and secure your file storage wizardry, but the API design, and operations should NOT be a focal point of your patent. You want people to integrate with your "secure cloud storage distribution and aggregation", bake the API design and process into their businesses, you want the cloud storage industry to speak your API -- don't lock it down, otherwise API consumers will look elsewhere.</p>

<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MikeAmundsen/posts/9d8QTVVDuJd">I was reminded by my friend Mike Amundsen of the importance of storytelling in our world</a>. When I am asked by anyone doing APIs, what is the most important thing they should be doing, my answer is always "storytelling". I don't care if its internally, publicly, on the corporate blog, or your personal blog, tell the story of what you are doing. I do not care how good your API is, if you aren't telling the story of this, nobody is going to care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I hold up storytelling as the most important tool in your toolbox within developer groups, they often snicker, dismissing it. I also have a contingent of my NOT fanbase in the API space who love to dismiss me with -- nobody reads or cares about stories! I'm never phased by these folks, my focus is on the people who are truly trying to build community, and reach their intended audience. #NoHaterz</p>
<p>While stories swirl all around is many forms, the one I like to reference the most, is when it comes to the mating ritual that is startup funding. If you are looking to get funding for your startup, you have to be sending the right signals, otherwise your VC mate will never be interested in you. You will need to be on TechCrunch, Venture Beat, and other tech blogs. Hacker News, Reddit and Hacker News needs to be in sync. Your stories should also be in sync with what is floating around VC firm blogs, aggregate, and other investor related streams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Startup valuations are are defined by an ocean of stories crashing on the shore each day. Bots are a thing because of storytelling. We are focusing on selling to the enterprise and abandoning B2C solutions because of storytelling. Google loves them some moonshot storytelling. Elon Musk understand the importance of the right story at the right time. Stories of what people are using. Stories of what people are investing in. Stories of what the future will hold, and will be a 20B industry by 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is marketing Kin! I'd put it in the fiction section of the library if I was in charge, but I'm not. Its all storytelling. If you need another example, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">visit my secret to Amazon's success post</a>. This story does 2K page views a month, and I've seen it referenced in keynotes, framed on the wall of a bank, and on the home page of a federal agencies internal portal. This story is more fiction than it is fact, yet it keeps on resonating with folks, getting passed around, and turning people on to the concept of APIs, and why they are important.</p>
<p>Please keep telling your story, if for no other reason, so that I have stories to retell. ;-)</p>

<p><a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/?doc">I came across the Wikimedia Unique Devices data set, which also is served up as an API endpoint, along with the other APIs the platform offers</a>. The data set and API provides access to a list of unique devices that have visited Wikipedia, for a specific period of time.</p>
<p>The data set and API only has data back to January currently, but I'm sure is something that will evolve over time. I really like the fact that we have organizations who are operating at scale, and are open and willing to share their data. This type of information is high value, and is something that can help us all better understand the ever shifting digital landscape around us--thank you Wikimedia for making accessible.</p>
<p>While playing with their <a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/?doc">Unique Device API</a>, I also noticed how transparent they are with their page view data, also making it available as simple set of API endpoints. I know Wikimedia is a non-profit, but I can't help but feel their way of doing things provides a blueprint that other commercial platforms should consider following.</p>

<p>I am <a href="http://apis.how/3bjch3csvo">working with my partner Cloud Elements</a> to build out a community of evangelists, who are interested in delivering on <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">many of the essential building blocks I track on when it comes to API evangelism</a>. I get regular requests from companies who are looking for evangelism and advocacy resources -- in desperate need of smart folks who can help craft content, crank out code, in the service of evangelizing a platform.</p>
<p>The work I'm doing with Cloud Elements, is the early work to help deliver on what API providers, and service providers are needing. Right now we are on-boarding new folks to the concept, and getting feedback on what some of the common elements, and challenges will be. One of the folks I'm engaging with on this is expert PHP and API developer, tech lead, author, consultant and open source maintainer, Lorna Mitchell (<a href="https://twitter.com/lornajane">@lornajane</a>).</p>
<p>Lorna is one of several folks I've been working with to help deliver on API Evangelist projects ranging from blog, and white papers, to training, and how-to guides. If you are a PHP developer, <a href="http://www.lornajane.net/?s=git&amp;submit=Search">have been learning about Git and Github in the last couple of years you have probably come across Lorna's work</a>. I was talking to my friend Mark Body on Skype today, and mentioned Lorna and he said oh yeah, I've used her Git training materials before, in my stories and talks -- something I echoed as well, having pointed my readers and clients to her training materials regularly.</p>
<p>After five years of doing what I call hacker storytelling, writing code, JSON, and stories about APIs, I understand how much hard work goes into creating content that is educational and simple, focused on very technical topics like APIs, while also driving search engine traffic over long periods of time. Lorna has done very well these areas,crafting blog posts that will keep being surfaced in Google searches for a long time to come, and help walk people through some very lofty technical concepts--wave after wave.</p>
<p>If you are needing help with storytelling as part of your industry, or API platform, let me know. I'm happy to see where I can help. Feel free to reach out to Lorna as well, she is looking to help the right companies and platforms craft white papers, guides, training and tutorials. If you are an evangelist who is looking to do the same, let me know, and I'm also happy to plug you into the community we are assembling, and see where you can help deliver. If you want to test drive some of first tasks and challenges we have going on in the beta phase, you are welcome to sign up on your own at&nbsp;<a href="https://cloudelements.influitive.com/join/dev032016">Mt. EveREST</a>-- things are just getting going, and we could use your feedback.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://api.slack.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/slack-platform-keeping-in-touch.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the side effects of the recent bot craze, is that I'm getting to showcase the often very healthy API practices of Slack, as they grow, scale, and manage their developer ecosystem. Slack is beginning to renew my faith that there are API providers out there who give a shit, and aren't just looking to exploit their ecosystems. There are two Slack blog posts that have triggered these thoughts, <a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/the-slack-platform-roadmap-34067b054177#.mhuax8lrn">one on the Slack platform road map</a>, and <a href="https://slackhq.com/a-little-thing-about-release-notes-997d2e06842d#.hmmeyia86">a little thing about release notes</a>, both of which reflect what I would love to see other API providers emulate in their platform operations.</p>
<p>Slack is going the extra mile to set the right tone in their community, with what I consider to be some of the essential communication building blocks of API operations, but they simply call <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"keep in touch"</strong></span>:</p>

<ul>
</ul>
<p>I just copied and pasted that from their developer portal. Slack does not stop there, also providing an&nbsp;<a title="Frequently asked questions" href="https://api.slack.com/faq">FAQ</a>, a&nbsp;<a href="https://api.slack.com/docs/community-code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://trello.com/b/HPpcIqd8/slack-app-ideaboard" target="_blank">Ideaboard</a>&nbsp;to further set the tone for how things can and should work in a community. What I like about the tone Slack is taking, is that it is balanced--"keep in touch"! Which really is just as much about us API consumers, as it is about Slack. Slack has done the hard work of providing most of the essential API building blocks, as well as a valuable API resource, now its up to the community to deliver--this balance is important, and we should be staying in touch.</p>
<p>Remember the tone Twitter took with us? Developer Rules of the Road!! Very different tone than "keep in touch". The tone really matters, as well as the investment in the common building blocks that enable "keeping in touch", both synchronous, and asynchronously. Having a road map, and change log for your API goes a long way, but telling the behind the why, how, and vision behind your road map and change log--gives me hope that this API thing might actually work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite popular belief in Silicon Valley, there are many different ways to fund the design, development, deployment, and operation of valuable API resources. Not all APIs are destined to be the next Amazon, Twitter, or even Twilio. Some APIs just need exist, be available, and will never be a revenue engine--one of these APIs is the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk-info/#judge-data">Court Listener API.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/">Version 3.0 of the Court Listener API possesses 15 valuable endpoints</a>, providing access to&nbsp;courts, dockets, opinions, people, sources, ratings, and other details about how laws are made in the United States. <a href="https://free.law/2016/04/19/judicial-database-announcement/">With their latest release containing a comprehensive database of judges and the judiciary, to be linked to Court Listener&rsquo;s corpus of legal opinions authored by those judges</a>.</p>
<p>Increasingly APIs like Court Listener, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) API</a>, are capturing my attention. These types of APIs represent the type of impact I'm looking to make using APIs, going beyond what APIs can do for a single application or industry, but what they can do for wider sections of our society. Focusing on getting agile, nimble, and more efficient in how craft laws in our country, and how we make sure people are fed, and find the government services they need in their life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/donate/">The Court Listener API depends on grants, and donations to operate</a>, which is an approach I will be showcasing more when it applies to APIs that deliver valuable human, civic, and research related resources. APIs like the Court Listener API provide an important window into how our local, state, and federal judicial system is operating (or not), and will need our financial support to do what they do. Which I think is a very viable approach to designing, deploying, and operating APis -- that is, if we all step up and support these efforts.</p>

<p>I am using my <a href="http://minimum.viable.api.operations.definition.apievangelist.com/">minimum viable API operations definition tool</a> to continue profiling the API sector, this time to size up the Slack API community. Slack is kind of a darling of the API space, so it kind of seem silly to profile them, but profiling those who are doing this API think right, is what API Evangelist all about--whether I follow the hype or not.</p>
<p>Using my minimum viable API definition, I went through the Slack API portal looking for what I'd consider to be the essential building blocks that any modern API platform should have.</p>

<p>Performing better than <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/21/sizing-up-the-imaterialise-3d-printing-api-with-my-minimum-viable-api-operations-definition/">the review of the i.Materialise 3D printing API</a> that I conducted the other day, Slack checks off all but one of the essential building blocks-everything except for pricing. The only other area(s) that I find deficient, is when it comes to machine readable API definitions like OpenAPI Spec and Postman Collections. These aren't required for success, but they can sure go a long ways in helping developers on-board from documentation, to generating code, and tooling that will be needed for integration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm assuming Slack hasn't generated OpenAPI Specs because they have a more XML-RPC design, which I think many folks assume can't be documented in this way. While it doesn't lend itself to more easily being documented with OpenAPI Spec, I found some simple little hacks that make it doable, allowing you to also document even XML-RPC designs. Having some OpenAPI Specs and Postman Collections would make the API more accessible for people looking to play with.</p>
<p>Anyways, I just wanted to test out the <a href="http://minimum.viable.api.operations.definition.apievangelist.com/">minimum viable API operations tool</a> on another API. I am trying to profile several APIs in this way each week, helping the number of APIs I am monitoring grow, while also encouraging other API providers to follow Slack's lead.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/04/25/openapi-specifications-for-642-of-the-schemaorg-types/">OpenAPI Specifications For 642 Of The Schema.org Types</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">25 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://schema.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/schema-org/schema-org.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am gearing up for another wave of <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition</a> work, so I am taking the opportunity to produce some more tooling that assists me in the process. One of the tools I want to build, is a simple solution for walking me through one or many OpenAPI Specs, and push me to make sure every parameter has a complete set of descriptions. I possess amazing powers of bullshit, and can craft default description for almost anything I come across, but it would be nice to have an an ever evolving autocomplete dictionary to augment my existing super powers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already have <a href="http://apis.json.autocomplete.apievangelist.com/">an APIs.json driven autocomplete tool, that loops through all the parameters within the OpenAPI Specs that are indexed</a>. I just needed a rich set of fields and parameters to pull from -- <a href="https://schema.org">Schema.org</a>. The rich vocabulary that is Schema.org possesses 992 properties across 642 schema types. I've long wanted to craft OpenAPI Specs for Schema.org, but needed a reason to help push things forward, and this is a perfect opportunity to kick things off.</p>
<p><a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/">As a starting point, I created 642 separate OpenAPI Specs</a>. One for each of the schema types. I already have an API that will generate an OpenAPI Spec from any JSON schema, building out GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods, as well as a default 200 response, and connecting it to the schema for the API response definition. As I was doing the work I realized that I didn't want to limit the OpenAPI Specs to just the JSON version, so as I generated I also published a YAML version.</p>
<p><a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/schema-org-api-definitions.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Next I'm going to use <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/schema-org-openapi-specs/tree/gh-pages/api-commons">these 642 OpenAPI Specs as an autocomplete index</a> for helping me quickly fluff up the parameters of other existing API definitions. Next I'll work on wiring up the hierarchies and relationships present in the Schema.org definitions. Right now, none of the OpenAPI Specs will validate as the parameter types aren't all valid, but I didn't want to lose the object references.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond being an autocomplete index which I can use across my micro tools for working with API definitions, I am thinking this Schema.org work will bear a shit ton of fruit in future work. I would like to have API implementations for many of the more common Schema.org types, allowing me to help folks design, and deploy Schema.org compliant APIs. Something that I feel will go a long way to help stabilize and standardize APIs, by helping them speak using a more common vocabulary.</p>
