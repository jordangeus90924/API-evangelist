I started [actively looking for evangelists, advocates and ambassadors in multiple cities last week][1]. I got a great response from quite a few folks who were already evangelizing in their communities or just curious about evangelism.

Even with the response I’m still looking for evangelists in Portland, OR, Seattle, WA and Austin, TX.

If you're interested in attending tech meetups and hackathons in your town and evangelizing some innovative API and developer platforms, I want to talk more.

I was surprised to get numerous folks contacting me in other cities around the world, saying they were open evangelism in their area. Even though I’m actively looking in Portland, OR, Seattle, WA and Austin, TX, I’m still looking to add other cities to my list--so don't hesitate to reach out.

Visit the i[nterested in evangelism page][2], submit the form and I’ll get you plugged in.
