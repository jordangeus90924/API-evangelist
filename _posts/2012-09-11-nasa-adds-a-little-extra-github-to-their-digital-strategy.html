<p><a title="NASA HTML Digital Strategy" href="https://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/index.html"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/nasa/nasa_logo.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></a>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking the <a title="progress of each federal agency&rsquo;s adoption of the White House CIO digital strategy" href="/federal_government.php">adoption of the White House CIO's digital strategy</a>, trying understand each agency's mobile and API plans.
<p>Today I noticed that NASA, in addition to publishing their digital strategy in <a title="NASA HTML Digital Strategy" href="https://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/index.html">HTML</a>, <a title="XML" href="https://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy.xml">XML</a> and <a title="NASA JSON Digital Strategy" href="https://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy.json">JSON</a>, added a "recent commits" Github widget on their digital strategy homepage.
<p><a title="NASA Github Recent Commits" href="https://github.com/nasa/digital-strategy"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/api-evangelist/nasa/NASA+-Recent-Commits.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></a>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small, but very important addition.  It shows that NASA sees the importance of not just using Github, but pushing code and interacting with developers via the social network.
<p><a title="Github" href="https://www.github.com">Github</a> is a service that is getting more traction within government, and I hope that more federal agencies don&rsquo;t just put it to use, but make it part of the culture within their organization.
<p>Github is more than a code repository, it will also help your agency be more "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">collaborative and open by default</span></strong>".
