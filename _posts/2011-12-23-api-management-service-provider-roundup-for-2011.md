{% include JB/setup %}<p>As 2011 comes to an end, I’d like to take another look at what I learned about the API management service provider space in 2011.I started the year engaging 3Scale, Apigee and Mashery, trying to find a platform to build the Mimeo Connect API platform on.Then spent the entire year getting to know each of the API management service providers, and the products they offer.At the end of the year, we are discussing the relevancy of API service providers, so I think a year-end API service provider post is due.The First DimensionTo make sense of the API management space, I’m looking at it in five separate dimensions.</p>
