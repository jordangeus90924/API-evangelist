<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/gluecon.jpg" alt="" align="right" />I'm preparing for a talk tomorrow at the [Glue conference][1] in Colorado. Glue is a conference that assists architects, developers, administrators and integrators in solving problems around web application integration.

Glue is about all of bits and pieces, APIs and meta-data, standards and connectors that will help us to glue together the varying applications of the new platform.

I'm joining [Justin Tormey][2], Director, Customer Evangelism - Open API Platform at Alcatel-Lucent to present a session called [Finishing School for Potential API Providers][3].

The outline for our session is:

  * If you build it... they won't come
  * Common Building Blocks
  * Innovative Building Blocks
  * Developer ? Developer
  * Monetization
  * Customers ? Customers
  * Make it concrete.
  * Evangelism
We hope you can make it out to Glue for our session at 1:30-2:00 PM on Wednesday. It should be a realistic perspective about whats needed for anyone looking to deploy an API.

You can still tickets get tickets for Glue on their [registration page][4].
