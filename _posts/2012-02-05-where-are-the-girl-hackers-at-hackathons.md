{% include JB/setup %}<p>I brought my 11 year old daughter Kaia, to the Trojan Hack at USC Friday night and Saturday, which was a new experience for her.I wouldnâ€™t say she is on a track to be a hacker like her dad, but she does have a Chromebook, iPhone and is pretty technologically literate.She has asked me a couple times about teaching her how to build a game, or some sort of fashion web site.She has her own Wordpress blog and even went and setup her own Wordpress.com account to blog about Harry Potter without my help.</p>
