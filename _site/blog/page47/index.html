<p><span>As we gear up for&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam, March 24-26th</a><span>, I&rsquo;m spending my time getting to know API companies across Europe. I published a&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/27/apis-coming-out-of-the-united-kingdom/">listing of APIs I found from the United Kingdom</a><span>&nbsp;a few days ago, and next up is taking a look at what APIs are coming out of the Netherlands.</span></p>
<p>Last week I did a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/04/apis-coming-out-of-the-netherlands/">roundup of 17 APIs out of the Netherlands</a>, but thanks to Twitter, and specifically&nbsp;Gerard van Enk (<a href="https://twitter.com/gvenk">@gvenk</a>) who was curating a spreadsheet of APIs, I was able to double the amount of APIs I'm tracking on out of the country.</p>

<p>The educational system in the Netherlands is complex, and many public bodies are tasked with keeping schools and students on the right track. However, data regarding this task is made available to the general public in a way it is not easily processable, which makes checks by the public (and press) more difficult. The OpenOnderwijs API alleviates this problem by providing a unified interface to data on education collected from several institutions with different responsibilities with regard to the Dutch educational system, such as DUO, Onderwijsinspectie and Vensters voor Verantwoording. The OpenOnderwijs API is built on open source technology, such as Scrapy for scraping school data (the scrapers can be found at Github), Sphinx for the documentation, and ElasticSearch for efficient data storage and retrieval. Also, all school addresses are geocoded using the BAG42 service, an Dutch initiative aiming to integrate high quality, official data sources with &ldquo;regular&rdquo; geocoding.</p>

<p>With multiple Paris API events, and a single API event in Madrid so far, I'm very pleased with the types of API conversations going on in Europe, and getting really excited to see who comes together to talk APIs in Amsterdam.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-building-blocks-design.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Over the last couple months I&rsquo;ve been taking a deeper look at the API design space, trying to understand more about the tools and services that are emerging, and the different approaches being employed throughout the API design lifecycle.</p>
<p>I started first with trying to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/22/the-evolving-motivations-behind-api-definitions/">understand the evolving motivations behind why people are using API definitions</a>, then I spoke with API with the creators of API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, the three leading API design providers out there, to understand more about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/31/the-vision-behind-swagger-api-blueprint-and-raml/">vision behind their various approaches to API design</a>.</p>
<p>After talking to each of the providers, I wanted to understand more about the tooling that was emerging from each of the providers, and went through what has emerged out of each of the Blueprint, RAML and Swagger communities.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m continuing my research this week this time and expanding my understanding of the differences between the three API definition formats of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/27/api-design-tooling-from-api-blueprint/">API Blueprint</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/01/api-design-tooling-from-raml/">RAML</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/25/api-design-tooling-from-swagger/">Swagger</a>.  To push my understanding of each approach I worked on developing an API definition for a simple product API, in each of the three formats.</p>
<p><strong>API Blueprint</strong><br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/9442237.js"></script>
</p>
<p><strong>RAML</strong><br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/9442232.js"></script>
</p>
<p><strong>Swagger</strong><br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/9442340.js"></script>
</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not done with each of these definitions, I&rsquo;m still learning the nuances of each of the approaches to describing an API, but I learned a lot about each of the definition formats.  Honestly, each format has its pros and cons, but all of them get you to the end goal of being able to describe an API interface.</p>
<p><strong>JSON vs. Markdown</strong><br /> While evaluating the I can&rsquo;t help but bring some of my personal baggage to the table. When it comes to JSON vs. Markdown I feel like I&rsquo;m in 2008 and struggling to leave my love of XML behind and learn JSON, secondarily some of the same emotions I&rsquo;m having switching my blogs to use Jekyll where I can use either HTML or Markdown for my posts. In short, I have more experience with Swagger, and I love me some JSON, so the markdown is harder for me to adopt. This is just my baggage, but I&rsquo;m sure others will face it as well.</p>
<p>I personally have a preference for Swagger, because of my experience with it and the JSON formatting, but I can buy into the promise of a markdown approach like RAML and API Blueprint.  I feel like Swagger is machine readable formats, while Blueprint and RAML are more technical specifications. I&rsquo;m not completely sold on the fact that markdown will be significantly more easier for non-developers than the JSON format, something I&rsquo;ve stated before, but I could see a new breed of API designers emerge who will have a fondness for markdown over the JSON.</p>
<p><strong>All About The Tooling</strong><br /> The big thing I experienced in this process is understanding the difference the tooling makes. Using Apiary.io for designing with API Blueprint, the API Designer from from Mulesoft for working with RAML, makes a huge difference in the process. There is no design tooling for Swagger, using Apiary and API Designer showed me the importance the tools will play in the future of API design&mdash;I think it will be the tools, not necessarily the API definition formats that become the differentiator.</p>
<p>I think it will be the tools that will help API designers become fluent in either RAML, Blueprint or Swagger, much like WYSIWG editors have done for HTML. Each API definition format will be how we share, communicate and collaborate through the API design lifecycle, but the tooling will be how we create, manage and publish API definitions--few will hand-write API definitions.</p>
<p><strong>Templates</strong><br /> Maybe its just the way that I learn, but one thing that would help through the process of becoming fluent in RAML, Blueprint or even Swagger would be templates that act as live examples. I was able to find hello world examples for both Blueprint and RAML that I could work backwards from to learn each API definition format, but making templates more available would help. Apiary gives you a nice starter template when you first kick off a new API, and both provide you with a wealth of documentation to work from, but a library of API design templates of various complexity and applications would facilitate the learning process.</p>
<p>These are just some of my thoughts after spending time trying to define the same API design in three different API definition formats. I will keep pushing forward with my research into <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, and share as many stories as I can. I think I need to generate more API definitions in RAML and API Blueprint, before I will truly understand the nuances between each of the platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I'm adding Mike Amundsen's (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>)&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/mamund/9443276">Hello World Products API in ALPS</a> he referenced below. I think it is a very intuitive, and clean approach to defining API interfaces, and it makes me happy to see so many roads to get to the same place--some roads are short, some are long, some have scenery and some are just on the freeway. &nbsp;</p>

<p>As part of the new developer program, you can also submit your work for inclusion on their <a href="https://github.com/integrations">integrations page</a>, which is essentially a showcase of the best Github integrations out there.</p>
<p>A beta program or refined developer group within your API ecosystem makes sense. Having an API access tier where the more engaged developers can step up, and play a closer role in the API roadmap, can bring some serious value to the table.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve blogged about the benefits of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">multiple levels of API access</a> for a couple years now, and Github&rsquo;s approach shows their API ecosystem is maturing, and they are further formalizing the incubation of ideas, applications and partnerships within the Github API ecosystem.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2014</span>
        <p><a title="Pop Up Archive" href="https://www.popuparchive.org/" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pop-up-archive/pop-up-archive-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the most enjoyable thing about being the API Evangelist is talking to API providers about their strategy, and helping brainstorm what they should do next. I have multiple APIs I do this with regularly, either because I&rsquo;m an advisor, big fan, or simply because they pay me. ;-) My favorite discussions are from the providers that are fine with me retelling their story publicly, APIs like the <a href="https://www.cashtie.com/">Cashtie API</a> and the <a href="https://popuparchive.com/">Popup Archive</a>.</p>
<p>Anne and Bailey over at Popup, a audio transcription API, talk with me regularly about their API development, deployment and now evangelism strategy. The Popup Archive API meets the first rule of APIs for me&mdash;do one thing and do it well, providing clear value for developers. The Popup Archive does this with audio transcription, opening up a whole world of audio to being searchable via an API. Think about the potential of making old radio programs indexed, and searchable online, giving new life to legacy content.</p>
<p>Anne and Bailey have built a high value web site and API, and recently finished their <a href="https://developer.popuparchive.com/">interactive documentation</a>, and are ready for business. They are at that amazingly exciting, and at the same completely terrifying step of having to evangelize their API and make the rubber meet the road--they have a valuable API resource, but now what?</p>
<p>Anne and Bailey have some great ideas about how the audio transcription API could be used, and they have some partners who are kicking the tires, understanding what is possible with integrating with Popup Archive API. This is where you start! You harness the ideas, and the early integrations and you tell the story of how the Popup Archive is providing a solution. Tell these stories on the Popup Archive Blog, on the Twitterz, and anywhere else you can find an audience.</p>
<p><a title="Pop Up Archive" href="https://www.popuparchive.org/" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pop-up-archive/old%2Btime%2Bradio.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Then launch a formal idea showcase where you can submit ideas on how the Popup Archie could be put to use, allow people to browse and search the idea showcase and imagine what is possible. Next establish a section for actual case studies, and as partners and other developers successfully integrate, tell these stories as well, but in a more formal way, demonstrating established approaches for putting the Popup Archive API to use&mdash;not just the dreamy ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next I told them to start monitoring the landscape of where they think their potential users are, find the radio stations, and media outfits who have Twitter accounts. Understand who the audiofiles, archivists, DJs, performers and bloggers who care the most about the audio space. Spend time each week discovering, living and understanding this space, all while you are telling stories about the Popup Archive and its valuable API.</p>
<p>Gather your ideas on how an API could be put to use, showcase how the API is being actively used, tell the stories, and actively explore and get to know the landscape of the online world you think will find the API resource most valuable. Eventually you will find more stories, build relationships with new developers, and discover other business interests that can put the API to use. Its a natural, ongoing API evangelism cycle&mdash;not to be confused with marketing or sales.</p>
<p>In the end its not just API evangelism, its about building your own awareness of a space, and telling stories of the value your API delivers&mdash;then repeat, repeat, repeat. Each week you will learn more, your storytelling voice will get stronger, your community will get bigger, and your API will grow and mature.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-stack-cash.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>There is an interesting conversation triggered by a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/us-government-apis/mQlwYRK5Y_0">question from Mr. Gray Brooks at the GSA on the federal government API Google Group</a>, regarding whether there are any agencies who are charging for access to their APIs. I thoroughly enjoy the growing community of open data and API folks that are operating around city, state and federal government currently, and how we are all turning these questions into full blown conversations that can actually help move things forward.</p>
<p>First Luke Fretwell(<a href="https://twitter.com/lukefretwell">@lukefretwell</a>)&nbsp;from Govfresh responded with <a href="http://govfresh.com/2014/03/government-charge-api-fees/">Should government charge API fees?</a> I totally agree with Luke, that we shouldn't be imposing fees on API consumers at this stage, potentially scaring users off, or stifling innovation that could occur. Government should understand that the costs of data gathering, publishing, and managing APIs should be an accepted cost of doing business as a public entity. Luke ends with potentially charging for high volume usage in the future, but for now let the resources flow!</p>
<p>Next Mark Head(<a href="https://twitter.com/mheadd">@mheadd</a>), Open Data Evangelist for City of Philadelphia chimed in with <a href="http://civic.io/2014/03/07/apis-to-charge-or-not-to-charge/">APIs : To Charge or Not to Charge</a>. Mark makes three excellent points that need to be considered before you charge for access to APIs 1) identifying who is using government APIs 2) APIs as a shared resource 3) sustainability of IT infrastructure.  Mark nails it, in that that are more questions to be asked, and great deal of understanding needs be achieved before you can answer the question of &ldquo;to charge or not to charge&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Getting To Know Your Resources</strong><br /> Before government agencies consider charging for their API resources, they need to make sure they have an intimate understanding of what it takes to operate and scale existing APIs. Many people feel that applying API keys to government APIs is bad, and is all about locking up or controlling public data. In reality, keying up API access, measuring how APIs are actually used, applying meaningful metrics, presenting in sensible dashboards is how you begin the process of getting intimate with your API resources and how they are used&mdash;something government agencies need to step up.  There is not excuse for not doing this--there are <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">freemium solutions in private sector like 3Scale</a>, and you have your own <a href="http://bit.ly/1g6zFJf">open source solution for government with API Umbrella</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Getting To Know Your Audience</strong><br /> Before government agencies consider charging for their API resources, they need to make sure they have initiate understanding of who is using their APIs. There is no way that you can set a price for an API resource, without knowing who is going to use it, and what price point the market will bear. If the API resource you are deploying is being used by civic open data groups, the market won't take much, but if consumers of the API resource is large financial institutions, it is an entirely different conversation. Price shouldn't just be based upon covering costs, as Mark said their are other considerations with APIs being a shared resource&mdash;in short there will be numerous conversations that have to happen before pricing can be set, and a healthy understanding of who is using your APIs, and how they are putting them to use is critical.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/federal-government/nationl-park-ranger.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>My answer to whether government should charge for APIs, is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">yes</span>. We have to make sure and cover the costs of operations, and make sure new API resources get funded. However I second Luke and Mark as well, we can't let pricing get in the way of API usage, and there are many variables to consider before pricing can be set. My personal opinion is that all government APIs should require keys, so that agencies can measure and understand API usage, if developers want to get full downloads of data they can, but to use APIs you need to register and key up.  Entry level tiers should allow for sensible rate limits, but always cap usage, with the expectation that developers can request rate limit increases, which at some point may warrant the charging of fees. If all agencies employ this method, APIs can still be freely accessed, agencies have the data they need to better understand how APIs are use, and by whom, and heavy or specialized API usage can be dealt with on a case by case basis&mdash;leaving open the potential for fees applied to API usage in future&hellip;or not.</p>
<p>I still like the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/02/01/should-the-government-subsidize-and-profit-from-data-markets/">city and national park example </a>I pulled from a conversation with Andrew Nicklin(<a href="https://twitter.com/technickle">@technickle</a>) in New York a couple years ago. Some public parks are free and open, some have small usage fees, but all commercial activity on public lands requires additional levels of access, fees and even revenue sharing in some situations.  We just haven't applied the same thought process to our virtual public lands, and like we had to do in the early days of governing our public lands, we have some experimentation, learning and standardization to do around the management of our virtual public resources.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-spreadsheet-db.png" alt="" width="220" align="right" /></p>
<p>A question I get regularly at API Evangelist is around the need for spreadsheet to API, and database to API services. Every couple weeks I get DMs and emails from someone who ask what tools are available, and that they were thinking about developing a solution. Right now I have three separate people asking this, and rather than just reply in email I figured I&rsquo;d write a piece to respond, based upon my experience.</p>
<p>First, let me state that there is a need for simple spreadsheet to API solution. Much of the worlds data is locked up in spreadsheets, and in control of data stewards who don't access to API deployment resources. However, I'm not sure there is a lot of money to be made in providing this as a service, i feels like something that should just be default for all spreadsheet operations&mdash;you know like Google Spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Google Spreadsheet allows XML and JSON access to spreadsheets by default. in addition to the full blown <a href="https://developers.google.com/google-apps/spreadsheets/">Google Spreadsheet API</a>.&nbsp;The only problem is with Google Spreadsheet you have some size limitations that make it a solution for only the simplest of data sources. I have written several posts on deploying APIs from Google Docs for both <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/deploy-api-public-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">public</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/12/deploy-api-private-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">private</a> spreadsheets, and have received numerous requests for a cloud version of this functionality, that would allow anyone to quickly deploy APIs from Google Spreadsheet sources.</p>
<p>I think the fact that Google Spreadsheet is free to use, and has API access to is spreadsheets, make this a real tough space to make money in, even if you do smooth out the process. To further convince people to not reinvent the wheel, there is already the &ldquo;Wordpress&rdquo; for data management, called <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a>, which is, "a powerful data management system that makes data accessible &ndash; by providing tools to streamline publishing, sharing, finding and using data.&rdquo; CKAN is open source, and a tool that city, state, county and federal governments around the globe are downloading and deploying in growing numbers.</p>
<p>Even with the availability of Google Spreadsheet and its API, and data portal solutions like CKAN, this is still a problem I try to tackle from time to time, when I get the same itch as the people who have triggered this post. I&rsquo;ve created what I call my OnGithub solutions, which allows for data management via Github, and API deployment using simple AWS hosted API framework.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://data.ongithub.com/">Data.OnGithub.com</a></strong> - My attempt at providing users with a free (if publicly licensed) place to upload and manage their open data that originates in spreadsheets and CSVs within Github repositories.  The entire app runs on Github Pages, using HTML, CSS ad JavaScript for core functionality, making it something that can be forked and implemented by anyone.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://api.ongithub.com/">API.OnGithub.com</a></strong> - My attempt to provide the API layer on top of data.ongithub.com, separating the data management from the API deployment. This application runs as simple PHP API framework, deployed on Linux on AWS.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.socrata.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/socrata/socrata-vertical.jpeg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>While this work was interesting, it still didn&rsquo;t solve the problem of allowing the average data steward to easily manage their data that is warehoused in spreadsheets, and deploy APIs with no technical experience required.  However it was a fun exercise to see what is possible for developing open tooling around this problem.</p>
<p>When it actually comes to deploying services that address data management I&rsquo;ve watched providers like <a href="http://www.infochimps.com/">InfoChimps</a> try and end up pivoting, and others such as Kasabi and Emergent One try, then go out of business. There are successful providers like <a href="http://www.slashdb.com/">SlashDB</a>, <a href="http://www.junar.com/">Junar</a>, and <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a>, who focus on providing open data platforms, whether it originates from a database or a spreadsheet. In 2014 I predict we will continue to see new startups emerge that promise to solve this problem, but will run into walls when it comes to monetization. There is money to be made in delivering APIs from spreadsheets, there just won&rsquo;t be VC level money to be made when it comes to converting spreadsheets to APIs, but if you want to provide some open tooling and provide professional services, I think you can make an acceptable living.</p>
<p>The moral of this story is that if you want to do a startup, get funding and offer a data solution, you better demonstrate you have something really new and innovative, otherwise don&rsquo;t bother, the space is saturated. If you want to develop some open tools, or use existing open tools and help organizations tackle their open data problems, I think there is plenty of opportunity to make both significant change, but also make some money offering sensible consulting services.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of doing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKWgzOjgAjM">Carvoyant Connected Car Cast today with Bret Tobey and Matt Galvin, hosted by the infamous Mike Maney (@the_spinmd) today</a>. The session was nothing formal, just a conversation about cars and APIs.</p>
<p>The conversation triggered several potential stories for me, but after the talk I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about how they talked about the <a title="Carvoyant" href="http://www.carvoyant.com/" target="_blank">Carvoyant API</a> being a research &amp; development (R&amp;D) lab, and conversation starter about whats next for the automobile industry.</p>
<p>Auto companies are on board with APIs playing a significant role in the future of the auto industry, but their window for change is in not just years, but multiple years. Tech giants like Google and Apple are turning their attention to the opportunities surrounding the connected car, but their runway is pretty lengthy as well&mdash;highly dependent on the car manufacturers.</p>
<p><a title="Carvoyant" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKWgzOjgAjM" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/carvoyant/carvoyant-connected-car-cast.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Carvoyant has options for connecting cars right now, providing a device you can plug in cars that are 1996 and newer, and an API for developers to build apps that integrate with user&rsquo;s vehicles. Carvoyant isn&rsquo;t about delivering content to your vehicle like Apple and Google are working on, it is about getting data from your vehicle, about its location, engine, tires, fuel and other vehicle data points and automobile centric events.</p>
<p>Like other Internet connected devices in our lives its going to take some experimentation before we find the right formula that works for people and their beloved cars, the sort of R&amp;D that APIs are well suited for. I think vehicles play a pretty clear role in our lives, we understand the value they deliver, but I think its going to take some time to understand how to safely, and sensibly connect our cars to the Internet, and we need to jumpstart this conversation&mdash;not let it just be between car manufacturers and tech giants, but include auto enthusiasts, mechanics, developers and most importantly car owners.</p>
<p>As with other industries API are moving into, I&rsquo;m extremely excited about the opportunities, but also very concerned with the potential for exploitation of end-users. As we move towards a world of connected cars, we need to have some serious conversations appropriate uses of technology, access to data, privacy, security and numerous other challenges we face with the API connected automobile.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited that Carvoyant is available to connect cars now, and not having waiting for each year of new vehicles from manufacturers, allowing us to jumpstart not just the research &amp; development, but also the conversation about what a connected car in our world actually means.</p>

<p>I'm taking a look at the&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/24/landscape-targeting-payment-apis/">world of payment APIs</a>&nbsp;right now. As with all my other monitoring of the API space, I am only looking for the best approaches, by the most interesting companies in the space--I don't have time to track on everything,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am looking to take a snapshot of the payment API space, understand who the key players are, and how they are delivering valuable payment API resources that developers are actually using. Last week I puled together <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/26/payment-apis-that-i-am-watching/">38 payment APIs that I'm watching</a>, and this week I am spending some time going through their sites, looking for what I'd consider to be some of the common building blocks of payment APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently I have 50 building blocks I found across these 38 payment providers:</p>

<p>As with all of my research, this is ongoing. My hopes is to better educate myself (and you too), about the payment API sector, which I consider a pretty critical aspect of the overall API economy.</p>
<p>If there are any building blocks that you think should be included in my research,&nbsp;<span>let me know at&nbsp;</span><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a>, and I'll see about including.</p>

<p>I have a number of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/02/the-apis-that-i-depend-on-for-my-business/">APIs that I've successfully integrated with</a>, and an even greater number that I've just played around with, pulling data, seeing what is possible. If you have spent the time learning what an API does, and gotten familiar with the interface, that is worth something.  If you've successfully integrated with an API, understand its ins and outs, have code in production that depends on that API&mdash;that is worth a lot.</p>
<p>With all of this experience in working with APIs, how do you demonstrate it? We are seeing <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/04/finding-good-api-developer-talent-is-hard/">freelance agencies emerge that are focused on delivering developer talent</a> that companies can put to use when building web and mobile apps using APIs&mdash;how will they demonstrate an individuals skills when it comes to a variety of APIs?</p>
<p>At some point we are going to need some sort of badging or credentialing system to help us demonstrate the mad API skills we all possess. I'm not talking badges in terms of check-ins or game levels, I&rsquo;m talking it terms of demonstrated project experience on specific APIs. How much of an API interface have I hacked on? Do I have production experience with an API, if so how much?</p>
<p>There needs to be a central badge authority, using an open technology like <a href="http://openbadges.org/">Mozilla Open Badges</a>, and each API provider can work to establish various levels of badging. There will probably be a lot of meaningless badges that will emerge, but I think if we work at it, we can establish some real ways to measure and demonstrate API talent.</p>
<p>Right now I have a lot of API related experience, but no real way demonstrate this to any company or individual, beyond my blog, Twitter, Github and my charming personality. It would be cool if we could establish a badging and credential system that would work for quantifying all the amazing talent in the API sector and make sure it is put to good use.</p>

<p>The shortage of good API developer talent is something I see regularly, with the constant stream of job and project offers I get via email and LinkedIn. The first place companies and recruiters go when looking for API evangelists, developer evangelists, and API developers is apievangelist.com.</p>
<p>I feel bad for some of the newbies I encounter, thinking they are going to easily find API talent. There just aren&rsquo;t enough developers who demonstrate their API skills, and even fewer who strive to be API evangelists. With the growth of the space, this is increasingly a problem, something I think is beginning to turn around.</p>
<p>I recently stumbled across a site called APIXChange which focused on delivering API developer talent, but has recently pivoted to become Workmob:</p>

<p>WorkMob is a company built by freelance developers, for freelance developers. Its founders have been on both sides of the freelance fence. We've been developers who hated the hassle of sourcing work, dealing with mindless projects, and competing with one another as low-priced commodities in a freelance meat market. We've also been founders and product managers who needed to hire freelance developers to supplement our teams. We overcome many of the same hurdles from the other side. Finding the great freelancers in the noise of all the mediocre ones, accurately describing what we're trying to accomplish, and keeping our hires on track and productive.</p>

<p>I think Workmob and Airpair are just the beginning. We will see talent shops who focus specifically on API developers, and eventually specific API sectors like healthcare, government, and education. We will also see PR agencies emerge that offer API evangelism and developer advocacy as a service, grooming the next generation of evangelist armies, and satisfying the needs of a growing API industry.</p>
<p>It is interesting to watch the API universe expand and new crops of specialized services that are focused on APIs emerge.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-building-blocks-design.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Over the last couple months I&rsquo;ve been taking a deeper look at the API design space, trying to understand more about the tools and services that are emerging, and the different approaches being employed throughout the API design lifecycle.</p>
<p>I started first with trying to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/22/the-evolving-motivations-behind-api-definitions/" target="_blank">understand the evolving motivations behind why people are using API definitions</a><a>, then I spoke with API with the creators of API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, the three leading API design providers out there, to understand more about the </a><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/31/the-vision-behind-swagger-api-blueprint-and-raml/" target="_blank">vision behind their various approaches to API design.</a></p>
<p>After talking to each of the providers, I wanted to understand more about the tooling that was emerging from each of the providers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/27/api-design-tooling-from-api-blueprint/" target="_blank">API Blueprint</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/01/api-design-tooling-from-raml/" target="_blank">RAML</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/25/api-design-tooling-from-swagger/" target="_blank">Swagger</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While each of these providers have their own approach to defining APIs, and the API design lifecycle, after looking through what they offer, you start seeing patterns emerge. After reviewing what API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger bring to the table, I squinted my eyes and try to understand what some of the common building blocks are for the API design space&mdash;resulting in what I consider 22 separate building blocks:</p>

<p>As we gear up for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam, March 24-26th</a>, I&rsquo;m spending my time getting to know API companies across Europe. I published a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/27/apis-coming-out-of-the-united-kingdom/">listing of APIs I found from the United Kingdom</a> a few days ago, and next up is taking a look at what APIs are coming out of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>You tend to not think of what country an API is from, unless its attached to public infrastructure, or a company is extremely vocal about their home country. I confess that I couldn&rsquo;t name a single API from Amsterdam before this week, but now I notice that Distimo, Drillster, ElasticSearch, Peerreach, and TwitterCounter were all out of the Netherlands, and were APIs I am already familiar with.</p>
<p>I was able to easily find 17 separate APIs out of the Netherlands:</p>

<p>The educational system in the Netherlands is complex, and many public bodies are tasked with keeping schools and students on the right track. However, data regarding this task is made available to the general public in a way it is not easily processable, which makes checks by the public (and press) more difficult. The OpenOnderwijs API alleviates this problem by providing a unified interface to data on education collected from several institutions with different responsibilities with regard to the Dutch educational system, such as DUO, Onderwijsinspectie and Vensters voor Verantwoording. The OpenOnderwijs API is built on open source technology, such as Scrapy for scraping school data (the scrapers can be found at Github), Sphinx for the documentation, and ElasticSearch for efficient data storage and retrieval. Also, all school addresses are geocoded using the BAG42 service, an Dutch initiative aiming to integrate high quality, official data sources with &ldquo;regular&rdquo; geocoding.</p>

<p><span>I&rsquo;m working with the&nbsp;</span><a title="Cashtie API" href="http://bit.ly/1grzE1H">Cashtie API</a><span>&nbsp;to pull together an API evangelism strategy for the payments API. As I pull together, it seems like a great opportunity to share with you. Who knows, maybe you can use some of the elements in your own API strategy.</span></p>
<p>Next up is what I call <em>"landscape analysis"</em>, which is about monitoring the blogs, and other social network activity of the sector(s) you are evangelizing your API within:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Competition Monitoring -</strong> Evaluation of regular the activity of competitors, visiting their sites, and getting to know their customers.</li>
<li><strong>Industry Monitoring -</strong> Evaluation of relevant topics and trends of overall industry, industries that you are evangelizing within.</li>
<li><strong>Keywords -</strong> Established a list of keywords to use when searching for topics at search engines, QA, forums, social bookmarking and social networks&mdash;this should dovetail nicely into any SEO work your doing. You are doing SEO work?</li>
<li><strong>City and Country Targeting -</strong> Target specific markets with your evangelism. Get to know where your existing developers and target developers reside, and get local--be on the ground.</li>
<li><strong>Social Media Monitoring - </strong>Have a solid strategy and platform for pulling relevant data from Twitter accounts, #hashtag conversations, Github profiles, and other relevant platforms to use in your landscape analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "landscape", is the space you are looking at each and every day out your virtual window, as well as what your existing and target developers will see each day. It is your job as an evangelist or advocate to know this space well, understand all the elements of the landscape, key players, relationships, and be a contributing member to this landscape.</p>
<p>Lanscape analysis should be something you do every day, weaving it into your regular social media, and other online activities. Remember you aren&rsquo;t targeting this landscape of companies and users, you are looking to participate in the conversation, while also bring your API resources to the table.</p>

<p>I am preparing a job description for an API evangelist position at the <a href="http://bit.ly/1grzE1H">Cashtie API</a>, something I do for companies from time to time. When working on a new one, I go out and look at current API evangelist job positions, to see what is new and noteworthy since last time I did it.</p>
<p>While doing this today, I came across a <a href="http://jobs.akamai.com/job/Cambridge-API-Evangelist-Job-MA-02138/45263300/">posting for API Evangelist at Akamai</a>, and while&nbsp;reading, two lines really stood out:</p>
<blockquote><em>As an API Evangelist, you are a thoughtful voice that represents a new developer mode of interaction, both inside and outside the company.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>You will spread awareness of and encourage participation in our emerging API program to mold the future of our entire developer experience.</em></blockquote>
<p>Both of these lines reflect what any company should be looking for in their API evangelist. I really like the use of &ldquo;thoughtful voice&rdquo;, &ldquo;spread awareness&rdquo; and &ldquo;encourage participation&rdquo; and talking about how important the role is to the future of a company's &ldquo;entire developer experience&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When crafting your own role description for an API evangelist, make sure you spend some time looking through other companies job postings and see what details are most important to you.</p>

        <p><a title="flowdock" href="https://www.flowdock.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/flowdock/flowdock-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spend a lot of time thinking about the politics of APIs, which in my opinion is the soul of the API economy. There are numerous things that go into the politics of an API, including your terms of service (TOS), privacy policy all the way to sharing your security strategy and communicating with your developers.</p>
<p>The politics of APIs is all about the balance you take in your API operations, and how open, public, secure, transparent, accessible, and real you are in your overall approach. The politics of an API can reveal a lot about the company behind the resource, and will play a big role in how successful an API will ultimately be with the developer community.</p>
<p>Every once in a while I stumble across a new building block being used by a company, that I think is worthy of being added to my master list. This weekend I found a new one from the <a href="https://www.flowdock.com">chat &amp; inbox API Flowdock</a>&mdash;the &ldquo;thanks" page. Usually in the footer of an API developer site you will find links to an APIs terms of use, privacy policy, security and the other political building blocks of an API. Flowdock has all of this, but also has a new one&mdash;simply, <a href="https://www.flowdock.com/thanks">thanks</a>.</p>
<p>On their <a href="https://www.flowdock.com/thanks">&ldquo;thanks&rdquo; page</a>, Flowdock highlights &ldquo;the tools we use to create the best real-time teamwork environment possible&rdquo;, and says:</p>
<blockquote><em>Flowdock wouldn't be possible without some fine open-source software projects. These are some of the components we rely on, and we'd like to extend our thanks to all the authors</em></blockquote>
<p>Flowdock is right, we all depend on open-source software to make our increasingly API driven world go around. Whether it's the language(s) we program in, server OS, database platform, or the code libraries we use for API integration, open source software is an essential element of the API economy.</p>
<p>I think we all recognize this, and some of us talk about it publicly, and even fewer actively support the open source projects they depend on, but I don&rsquo;t think we showcase and pay tribute to this in a formal way. I like Flowdock&rsquo;s style, and think their approach to hanging a &ldquo;thanks: page right along with their terms of use, privacy policy and security overview, pays the proper respect to which building blocks are essential in building API driven platforms.</p>

<p><span>I&rsquo;m working with the&nbsp;</span><a title="Cashtie API" href="http://bit.ly/1grzE1H">Cashtie API</a><span>&nbsp;to pull together an API evangelism strategy for the payments API. As I pull together, it seems like a great opportunity to share with you. Who knows, maybe you can use some of the elements in your own API strategy.</span></p>
<p>Next up is blogging, an area I feel is the single most important part of your API evangelism strategy:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Projects</strong> - Establishing of editorial assembly line of technical projects that can feed blog stories, how-tos, samples and code libraries.</li>
<li><strong>Stories</strong> - Writing, editing and posting of stories derived from projects, with SEO and API area support by design.</li>
<li><strong>Syndication</strong> - Syndication to Tumblr, Blogger and other relevant blogging sites that actually add value to readers, not being spammy.</li>
</ul>
<p>This part of evangelism can be as involved as you like, being the work of a lone evangelist, or the work of a team of coders, writers, editors and community managers. The goal is to generate exhaust around your API, that will attract new developers to an API, as well as educate existing developers about the value an API delivers.</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t producing interesting projects around your API, and telling these stories far and wide, nobody will ever know your API exists, let alone put it to use.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/03/01/api-design-tooling-from-raml/">API Design Tooling From RAML</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">01 Mar 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://raml.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/raml/raml-logo.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><span>As part of my&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/16/api-design-do-you-swagger-blueprint-or-raml/">research in the world of API design</a><span>, I&rsquo;m looking into the different approaches by API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, to provide API definitions, services and tools that assist developers in better designing APIs. I have already look at the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/22/the-evolving-motivations-behind-api-definitions/">evolving motivations behind API definitions</a><span>, and some insight into the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/31/the-vision-behind-swagger-api-blueprint-and-raml/">vision behind Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML</a><span>, next up is taking a look at the tooling that is emerged around each approach.</span></p>
<p>I began with a look at the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/25/api-design-tooling-from-swagger/">tooling around Swagger</a>, then I laid out what is <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/27/api-design-tooling-from-api-blueprint/">offered around API Blueprint</a>, from Apiary.io&mdash;next up, <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a> which is developed by <a href="http://www.mulesoft.com/">Mulesoft</a>, and reflects the evolution of the API design space, making it much more attractive to the enterprise.</p>
<p>Like API Blueprint, RAML is a markdown based API description format, which is an evolution from the XML of WADL, and the JSON of Swagger. I think this approach to defining APIs has significance when exposing API design beyond the developers community, but only time will tell.</p>
<p>Everything RAML centers around the RESTful API Modeling Language:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec">RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) </a></strong>- A concise, expressive language for describing RESTful APIs. RAML is built on broadly used standards such as YAML and JSON and is a non-proprietary, vendor-neutral open spec.</li>
</ul>
<p>With RAML interpreters available in JS and Java:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RAML JavaScript Parser </strong>- A reference implementation of a RAML parser for JavaScript. It's based on PyYAML, written in CoffeeScript, and can be used as a node.js module or in-browser. It is compliant with RAML 0.8, and provided under an Apache 2.0 license.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>RAML Java Parser -</strong> A reference implementation of a RAML parser for Java. It's based on SnakeYAML, and written in Java. It can be added as a Java library into a project directly or through Apache Maven. It is compliant with RAML 0.8, and provided under an Apache 2.0 license.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the RAML interpreter you start seeing some pretty sophisticated tooling for the API design process emerge:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Designer </strong>- A web-based API development tool that allows API providers to design their API quickly, efficiently, and consistently, and socialize the design. It consists of a RAML editor side-by-side with an embedded RAML console (the API Console). It is provided under the open-source CPAL license.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>API Console - </strong>A graphical user interface for a RAML-defined API that visually exposes the API&rsquo;s structure and important patterns and serves as interactive API documentation. It is provided under the open-source CPAL license.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>API Notebook - </strong>A web-based, persistent, JavaScript scripting workspace that enables live testing and exploring of APIs, and saving API use cases as markdown gists, so they are versioned, forkable and shareable. It's an example of literate programming. It is provided under the open-source CPAL license.</li>
</ul>
<p>These API design tools reflect the open enterprise  approach to software development from Mulesoft, but there is also other tooling emerging from within the RAML community:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SoapUI RAML Plugin - </strong>SoapUI is a very popular functional testing tool, broadly used for testing APIs. It supports not only SOAP but also REST and any other HTTP APIs, as well as JMS, AMF and JDBC. The RAML plugin for SoapUI allows importing RAML descriptions of APIs into SoapUI to test those APIs. The plugin is provided under the open-source Apache 2.0 license.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>APIkit</strong> - A declarative toolkit that leverages RAML to facilitate the implementation of APIs. It uses RAML as the definition of the API, which can then be used with APIkit Maven- and Mule Studio-based tools for mocking the interface and implementing its backend using Mule flows. It is provided under the open-source CPAL license.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>RAML Store  - </strong>A simple storage API plus a persistence plugin which enables you to run the RAML API Designer locally (rather than using a cloud service) and still be able to manage and collaborate on your design. The service is built with node.js, using express and mongodb.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>JAX-RS Codegen -</strong> A set of Java tools that support an API-first approach to implementing RAML-described RESTful services in Java with JAX-RS. Given a RAML specification of an API, it generates corresponding JAX-RS-annotated interfaces and supporting classes, which can be used in your project to implement those spec-compliant APIs. This project is in early alpha. It is provided under the open-source Apache 2.0 license.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>RAML Sublime Plugin - </strong>This is a simple syntax highlighter for Sublime that provides support for the RESTful API Modeling Language (http://raml.org/). It is provided under the open-source Apache 2.0 license.</li>
</ul>
<p>When reviewing the tooling for RAML, you can tell some serious planning has gone into it. Wordnik was developing open tooling based upon their immediate needs, and Swagger just happened, with API Blueprint being designed to match the API design workflow of Apiary. Mulesoft obviously had time to put a plan together when it came to RAML, based upon what they already saw occurring in the space, and their own experience.</p>
<p>When it comes to tools that facilitates the API design process, RAML is definitely the leader. However Swagger and API Blueprint definitely enjoy a first mover lead in the world of delivering API design services. I&rsquo;m not convinced a first mover advantagee, or a suite of well designed tooling will be more valuable to developers&mdash;I will play with actually designing and deploying each platform next, to see what I learn by actually using Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML to design a basic API.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/europe11.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was able to update my API monitoring system to include the location of some of the APIs, allowing me to look at APIs by country and region. In preparation for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam</a>, I'm taking a closer look at what API innovation is coming out of Europe--first up the United Kindom.</p>
<p>I knew about some of the APIs like Datasift and The Guardian, but I enjoyed learning about the other 35 API companies that I discovered. I was only able to find the location of about 700 of the over 2000 API companies that I track on, but will continue to update the rest of the APIs as I can.</p>

<p>GoSquared helps you understand and improve your online presence. GoSquared creates two web applications for monitoring your website&rsquo;s traffic in real-time - Dashboard and Trends. Dashboard is a real-time traffic monitoring app that gives you an overview of your website&rsquo;s traffic right now - in a single glance. It lets you see which pages of your site are most popular, where your visitors are coming from, and info on every visitor currently browsing your website along with how they&rsquo;re browsing (what browser, operating system, screen size, etc.), which language they&rsquo;re speaking, and what city they&rsquo;re from. Dashboard doesn&rsquo;t just tell you who&rsquo;s on your site, it also knows what page they&rsquo;re on, and what pages they&rsquo;ve been on. It know&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;ve come from (Twitter, Digg, Google, etc.) making it easy to see when someone&rsquo;s talking about you. Trends takes all the data in Dashboard and builds beautiful, easy to read charts and tables so that you can analyse how your website has been performing over the past day, week, month, or year. Trends enables you to gain insights into your website&rsquo;s traffic data quicker than ever before - without having to click a single button.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apiblueprint.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apiblueprint/apiblueprint-logo-2.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><span>As part of my&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/16/api-design-do-you-swagger-blueprint-or-raml/">research in the world of API design</a><span>, I&rsquo;m looking into the different approaches by API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, to provide API definitions, services and tools that assist developers in better designing APIs. I have already look at the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/22/the-evolving-motivations-behind-api-definitions/">evolving motivations behind API definitions</a><span>, and some insight into the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/31/the-vision-behind-swagger-api-blueprint-and-raml/">vision behind Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML</a>, next up is taking a look at the tooling that is emerged around each approach.</p>
<p>I began with a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/25/api-design-tooling-from-swagger/">look at the tooling around Swagger</a>, and next up is to look at <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, from <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a>,&nbsp;which is centered around a markdown based API definition language:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> -</strong> Apiary.io&rsquo;s API definition language designed to allow anyone, not just developers to design APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>To put API Blueprint to use, Apiary provides a parser:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/snowcrash">Snowcrash</a> -</strong> The API Blueprint parser built on top of the Sundown Markdown parser</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to tooling around API Blueprint, it is all about the Apiary.io platform:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Apiary.io -</strong> Collaborative design, instant API mock, generated documentation, integrated code samples, debugging and automated testing</li>
</ul>
<p>Apiary.io delivers the features we are seeing emerge around Swagger and RAML, and more:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Server Mock - </strong>Providing a mock API interface allowing you to experiment with an API interface before you write any code</li>
<li><strong>Interactive Documentation </strong>- Auto generated API documentation that allows developers to authenticate and make live calls to an API while learning the documentation</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Sync -</strong> Apiary uses Github to store each API Blueprint, allowing it to be stored publicly or privately on Github, with automatic updating of API docs with each Github commit</li>
<li><strong>Command Line Tools -</strong> A separate command-line interface available as ruby gem, allowing for the automation and integration of API Blueprints it your regular workflow</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Inspector -</strong> Providing a proxy to run API calls through allowing the breakdown of each call to APIs, helping developers understand and debug APIs much easier</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong> - Communication tools within API blueprint documentation allowing team and public developer conversations</li>
</ul>
<p>I did find two other open tools for API Blueprint:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/gavel">HTTP Call Validator</a></strong> - Gavel is a tool for deciding which HTTP API call is valid and which is not</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd">API Blueprint Testing Tool</a> </strong>- Dredd is a command-line tool for testing API documentation written in API Blueprint format against its backend implementation.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that Apiary with API Blueprint was the first company dedicated specifically to API design. Swagger was born as a set of tools out of Wordnik, and not designed to be a product, with RAML coming later.  While Swagger was pushing API design into new areas beyond just interactive docs, Apiary and API Blueprint was the first API design only startup to emerge.</p>
<p>During 2006-2012, API management was being standardized by pioneers like Mashery, 3Scale and Apigee--now API design is now being defined by providers like Swagger, &nbsp;API Blueprint, and RAML. It shows that the API space is continueing to expand and mature, increasing the need to refine not just API design, but the overall API lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm taking a look at the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/24/landscape-targeting-payment-apis/">world of payment APIs</a> right now. As with all my other monitoring of the API space, I am only looking for the best approaches, by the most interesting companies in the space--I don't have time to track on everything,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am looking to take a snapshot of the payment API space, understand who the key players are, and how they are delivering valuable payment API resources that developers are actually using. So far I am tracking on 34 separate payment APis:</p>

<p><span>I&rsquo;m working with the&nbsp;</span><a title="Cashtie API" href="http://bit.ly/1grzE1H">Cashtie API</a><span>&nbsp;to pull together an API evangelism strategy for the payments API. As I pull together, it seems like a great opportunity to share with you. Who knows, maybe you can use some of the elements in your own API strategy.</span></p>
<p>Next up is developer engagement, and focusing on the ways you reach out to API consumers. You don&rsquo;t need to describe every way you are going to engage with developers, but you should make sure and pick a handful of channels and stick with them, regularly reaching out to developers, providing a communication platform they can depend on.</p>
<p>There are some proven approaches to developer outreach:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Fresh Engagement -</strong> Emailing new developers who have registered to see what their immediate needs are, while their registration is fresh in their minds</li>
<li><strong>Active User Engagement -</strong> Reaching out to existing, active users of an API and find out what they need. Profile them, including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and pull any profile information, then grade and categorize each developer</li>
<li><strong>Historical Engagement -</strong> Emailing historical active and / or inactive developers to engage and understand what their needs are and would make them active or increase activity, consider newsletter or personalized emails when appropriate</li>
<li><strong>Social Engagement - </strong>When emailing any developer, using Rapportive you can establish any URL, Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn profile they have and reach out via these networks</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other ways to reach out to developers, but you should have a regular rhythm for reaching out to new developers, existing developers will re-enforce relationships with your developers consistently through the channels that make the most sense.</p>
<p>If developers know they will get regularly information from you via a newsletter, and that you are accessible via common social media channels, they are more likely to reach out when they need help, and have you in the back of their mind when they do encounter a problem that your API provides a solution to.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-round.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As part of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/16/api-design-do-you-swagger-blueprint-or-raml/">research in the world of API design</a>, I&rsquo;m looking into the different approaches by API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, to provide API definitions, services and tools that assist developers in better designing APIs.  I have already look at the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/22/the-evolving-motivations-behind-api-definitions/">evolving motivations behind API definitions</a>, and some insight into the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/31/the-vision-behind-swagger-api-blueprint-and-raml/">vision behind Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML</a>, next up is take a look at the tooling that is evolving around each approach.</p>
<p>First up is <a href="https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger" target="_blank">Swagger</a>, from the folks over at <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/" target="_blank">Wordnik</a>. I would consider Swagger the first mover in this new world of API design, with the Wordnik team&rsquo;s approach centered around a JSON based API definition:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Swagger Core" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core">Swagger Core</a></strong> - A JSON based API definition format, which allows for the description of  REST APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>Around the Swagger core the Wordnik team developed a core set of tooling that met their immediate needs for the Wordnik API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Swagger CodeGen" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen">Swagger CodeGen</a></strong> - A template-driven engine to generate client code in different languages by parsing a Swagger Core definition</li>
<li><strong><a title="Swagger UI" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a></strong> - A dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation from a Swagger defined API</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondarily other more specific tools have emerged:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Swagger JS" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-js">Swagger JS</a></strong> - Javascript library to connect to swagger-enabled APIs via browser or nodejs</li>
<li><strong><a title="Swagger Node Express" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-node-express">Swagger Node Express</a></strong> - Swagger module for node.js w/express module</li>
<li><strong><a title="Swagger Socket" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swaggersocket">Swagger Socket</a></strong> - A REST over WebSocket</li>
<li><strong><a title="Swagger Play 2" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/tree/master/modules/swagger-play2">Swagger Play 2</a></strong> - Provides automatically-generated Swagger JSON for the Play! framework</li>
</ul>
<p>Swagger was born out of Wordnik&rsquo;s desire for interactive documentation, but evolved into tooling for generating server and client side code, and has ended up providing a central language for facilitating discussions around API design, deployment and integration in many other areas.</p>
<p>I know there are some other tools available out there for Swagger, this just represents would I could find easily off their Github account. If there are other Swagger tools you know of, let me know and I&rsquo;m happy to add to this post and my research.</p>

<p>It can be pretty difficult to explain exactly what an API does to the average person. Some people think of APIs being associated with databases, where others think they are always attached to online applications like Facebook or Twitter.  Then there are so many types of APIs, where do you start, when someone asks what is an API?</p>
<p>To help people understand APIs, it is best to move away from the technical explanation and get closer to the actual problem being solved by your API. Example, a new API I&rsquo;m working with called the <a href="http://bit.ly/1grzE1H" target="_blank">Cashtie API</a> lets you generate barcodes that can be scanned from mobile phones at the point of sale (POS) systems at major retailers&mdash;a technical explanation</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about a problem. Anyone selling a product or service (online or offline) would love to have their product in major retailers like Walmart, Target and CVS. The problem is how do you get your product into these stores? In this case, the solution is the Cashtie API, which allows mobile application developers to generate the barcodes that allow your customers to pay cash for products and services, or pay their bills at these retail locations.</p>
<p>It can be easy to think of your API in a technical sense, especially if you are the geek who developed it. What is really important, is that you think of it terms of providing solutions to actual problems businesses are facing. If you think of your API in these terms, and can easily articulate to any random person the value it delivers, there is a much greater chance your API will be put to use.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/02/24/the-importance-of-a-government-api-phase/">The Importance Of A Government API Phase</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stepping back and trying to understand more about where we are at in the <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">history of APIs</a>. Looking at the API space in terms of our past, provides me with a healthier understanding of where we are currently, and where things are possibly headed. I tend to not get blinded by the shiny new technology that surrounds us, hopefuly allowing me to see a bigger picture.</p>
<p>I just wrote about how I feel we are in what I would call the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/17/what-is-the-next-phase-of-apis/">enterprise phase of APIs</a>, where large companies, not just tech startups are seeing the benefit of web APIs. I think there will still be lots of innovation from startups, but to take the API economy to the level, where it is truly part of the global economy, the enterprise has to get on the train.</p>
<p>These phases of API evolution don&rsquo;t happen one after another, they overlap, with commerce, social, cloud and mobile all feeding into what is attracting large global enterprises to APIs, while all these sectors also need the enterprise to get on board--everything is interconnected. As with the enterprise layer of the API economy, I think the recent increased government awareness of APIs, is just as significant as the attention we are seeing from the enterprise.</p>
<p>While writing my post about the the enterprise phase, I noticed that I&rsquo;m speaking with just as many federal agencies as I have been from the enterprise. I can&rsquo;t help but look at this movement in government alongside the big moves from the enterprise. Many folks aren&rsquo;t seeing the movement they&rsquo;d like to from our government when it comes to APIs, but even though things aren't perfect, we are seeing big movement from all levels of government when it comes to open data and API, with over 75 federal agencies deploying APIs.</p>
<p>In the last month, I&rsquo;ve talked to numerous federal agencies about their API strategies, beyond just open data&mdash;I mean census, regulatory, patent, education, healthcare and other commerce stimulating aspects of our federal government, the big stuff. Thanks to the hard work of many open data and API savvy tech folks, the word is out across all levels of government, and people are asking for APIs. Citizens, leaders, other agencies, and even other countries are asking for simple web API access to our vital public resources, and the government is having to step it up.</p>
<p>Much like the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/17/what-is-the-next-phase-of-apis/">enterprise phase I described last week</a> needed social, cloud and mobile to make APIs work for the enterprise, I think it all will also depend on government having viable APIs. Much like our legacy economy, government and business work in concert, feeding each other&mdash;the API economy will be driven by not just the innovation of startups, and the global resources of the enterprise, it will depend on our government being machine readable by default.</p>
<p>Businesses will need to be able to efficiently monitor regulations, file and pay taxes, navigate the world of patents, and not just when they are required to interact with government&mdash;businesses need to be able to obtain resources from government in a frictionless, and beneficial way. Individuals will need to be able to apply for loans, file and pay taxes, and engage with government via their mobile devices and laptops--APIs will faciliate all of this.</p>
<p>When it come to the API economy, I am always stating that we can&rsquo;t just look at the technology of APIs, we have to look at the business and politics of APIs. As we try to understand where we are at, and where we are going, we have to look beyond the tech, understand that we not just need the enterprise on board, we also need the government to be up to speed on APIs, otherwise the rest of the space will suffer, and the API economy will sputter along, never quite achieving its full potential.</p>

<p>While looking through hundreds of blogs from API providers, one practice that I&rsquo;m seeing more of is companies showcasing their own use of their API. Some of you may think this is obvious, but I think a lot of companies are using their own API and never tell the story about how they are using their own services&mdash;I mean if your API is so great, demonstrate to people why it is so kick ass.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just say dumb shit like we eat our own dog food, show us how, where and why you use it. Prove to us that you use the same APIs that you are delivering to external developers. Are you using to drive your website? mobile devices? partner integrations? Let us know the details about how it was designed, deployed and the challenges you face in not just managing but also integrating it with your apps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you are using your APIs in some pretty cool ways internally, but if you don&rsquo;t tell the story to your external partners and developers, they will never know how cool your APIs really are. You never know, one of your stories might convince one of them to use your APIs as well.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/02/24/landscape-targeting-payment-apis/">Landscape Targeting: Payment APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-target.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I want to understand a business sector as part of my overall analysis, or part of a specific API strategy, I kick off what I call a <strong><em>&ldquo;landscape targeting&rdquo;</em></strong> campaign. This time around I am interested in better understanding the the landscape of the payment API space.</p>
<p>Every landscape targeting campaign begins with some Googling of the top key phrase, which this time is <em>"payment API"</em>. From this I manually build a list of key players in the payment API space. My goal is to not build a complete list, but a list of the players doing it well&mdash;screw the rest. I only have time to target the best approaches, and in the payment space I find roughly 35 players, which I will publish later.</p>
<p>While I am conducting this same procedure on all 35 payment companies, I start with the one I know the best, and feel will produce the most meaningful results&mdash;<a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>. To help me quantify Stripe&rsquo;s ecosystem landscape I execute the following:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Pull a Twitter profile for @Stripe, which gives me a snapshot of their Twitter account, via the Twitter API</li>
<li>Pull lists of @Stripe Twitter followers and friends Twitter IDs using the Twitter API</li>
<li>Pull a Twitter profile for the followers and friends of @Stripe, so I have each of their names, bios, location, and friend / follower count</li>
<li>Pull a Github profile for Stripe, which gives me a snapshot of their Github account, with overall activity, via the Github API</li>
<li>Pull a list of all Stripe repositories using the Github API</li>
<li>Pull a list of each repositories watchers, subscribers and contributors using the Github API</li>
<li>Pull each of those repo watchers, subscribers and contributors Github profiles using the Github API</li>
<li>Profile each Twitter follower using <a href="http://www.fullcontact.com/developer/">Full Contact API</a> to obtain their alternate Github or LinkedIn profile</li>
<li>Profile each Github user that shared their email address using Full Contact API to obtain their alternate Twitter or LinkedIn profile</li>
</ul>
<p>For Stripe, I ended up with 21K Twitter users, 30 repositories and over 5K Github users. &nbsp;You have 25K individuals and companies potentially depending on Stripe for payment API services. Of course a lot of these profiles will be useless, but once again I&rsquo;m looking for the cream on top of this landscape targeting&mdash;I don't have time to look at all details.</p>
<p>Multiple this by 35, and you have a pretty interesting definition of the payment API landscape. This is where the hard work begins. You need to sift through all of this data, find blogs, interesting tweets, leading companies, active developers, and any other gems that will potentially shine within the payment API landscape. I will spend next couple weeks refining, tagging and curating, and will continue in real-time as my research continues.</p>
<p>This approach is derived from what I've been doing to quantify the API space for the last 4 years, and also executing against other sectors like <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/">Baas</a>, Real-time, etc. My goal is to help me understand each business sector, while also producing enough data and content to tell stories on API Evangelist, publish open research projects on Github, and sometimes result in an industry white paper.</p>
<p>I Just thought I&rsquo;d share some of my approaches to using APIs to better understand the landscape of specific API business sectors, and show how I don't just talk about APIs, but I actually use them regularly to produce content.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Mobile-Back-end-Service"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/apistrat-baas-panel-nyc.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working with Phil Legetter (<a href="https://twitter.com/leggetter">@leggetter</a>) to put together a panel at API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam on APIs and realtime, and as I&rsquo;m working to bring together the leaders from the space together, I can&rsquo;t help but think of past APIStrat panels. At APIStrat we are looking to pull together the leaders from different business sectors and have a conversation on where we are, and where things are going with trends like API aggregation, automation, design, BaaS and realtime.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Mobile-Back-end-Service">APIStrat, NYC 203 we brought together the leaders from the backend as a service (BaaS) space,</a> including <span>Ilya Sukhar (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasu">@ilyasu</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.parse.com/" target="_blank">Parse</a><span>, Morgan Bickle (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/morganbickle">@morganbickle</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.kinvey.com/" target="_blank">Kinvey</a><span>, Marc Weil (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/marcweil">@marcweil</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cloudmine.me/" target="_blank">Cloudmine</a><span>, Miko Matasumura (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/mikojava">@mikojava</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://kii.com/" target="_blank">Kii</a><span>, Ty Amell (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/tyamell">@tyamell</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.stackmob.com/" target="_blank">StackMob</a><span>&nbsp;James Tamplin (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jamestamplin">@jamestamplin</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a>, resulting in a pretty interesting discuss about what is BaaS, and the future of the fast growing trend in using APIs for mobile development.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to March of 2014, Parse has been acquired by Facebook, Stackmob acquired by Paypal and shut-down just last week, and the speed at which the tech sector moves is really evident. I started tracking on BaaS in 2011, and just 3 years later the space has evolved fast&mdash;making conversations like the APIStrat BaaS panel critical in helping shape the industry.</p>
<p>As APIs + realtime technologies gain in popularity amongst startups and leading tech companies, its time to get together and have a conversation with leading tech companies in the realtime space like <a href="http://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>, <a href="http://www.pubnub.com/">Pubnub</a>, <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a>, and <a href="https://fanout.io/">Fanout.io</a> to name a few. Much like BaaS, the important conversations around key trends in API like realtime, will be occurring at APIStrat.</p>
<p>These conversations are why the <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> team and API Evangelist put on #APIStrat, and look forward to you being part of these important discussions. Make sure you are <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">registered for API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam, March 26-28th</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working with the <a title="Cashtie API" href="http://bit.ly/1grzE1H">Cashtie API</a> to pull together API evangelism strategy for the payments API. As I pull together it seems like a great opportunity to share with you. Who knows, maybe you can use some of the elements in your own API strategy.</p>
<p>First up, is goals. What are the goals of your API initiative?</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Increase Awareness of API Program</strong> - The number one priority for any API, increase awareness that you even exist!</li>
<li><strong>Growth in New Users </strong>- Everyone wants new registrations for the API--it s a great goal, but don&rsquo;t get too caught up in just acquiring new users.</li>
<li><strong>Growth in Existing User API Usage -</strong> How do we encourage existing users to consume more, be more successful in using API resources.</li>
<li><strong>Brand Awareness -</strong> Elevate the awareness of not just an API but the overall company brand(s), establishing life long customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few initial goals every company should consider when crafting an API evangelism campaign, but don&rsquo;t stop there, what are some other goals?</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>New Customers For Other Products -</strong> Do you have other products and services you&rsquo;d like your API end-users to be aware of?</li>
<li><strong>Value Add For Existing Customers - </strong>Maybe you have an existing customer base you want to encourage development of products, services and features that add value to their existing engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> - Money, of course, we all need to make money. How do we leverage API resources into new sources of revenue for our company?</li>
</ul>
<p>Having short term, and long term goals is essential to any API evangelism strategy. What are our long term goals? What goals do we have this week? How do they change over time? Documenting our goals is critical, so we can deliver on them, but also understand how we need to shift our goals to be more successful over time.</p>
<p>Do you have goals for your API program that aren't listed here? Share them with me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> with hashtag #apigoals.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/02/17/what-is-the-next-phase-of-apis/">What Is The Next Phase Of APIs?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">17 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-enterprise.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've been polishing my version of the <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">history of web APIs</a> since I started API Evangelist. Through my research it became clear that the world of web APIs had evolved through several key phases that have gotten us to where we are at, and were essential in making the API economy a viable opportunity. So far my history tracks on 5 key phases:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Commerce</strong> - The first wave of web apis came from commerce pioneers like Salesforce, eBay and Amazon deploying APIs to make commerce more distributed.</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Early pioneers like Flickr, Delicious, Facebook and Twitter have made the Internet social by default using web APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Business</strong> - As APIs evolved API management providers like Mashery, 3Scale and Apigee have standardized the business approach of leading APIs, delivering tools and services that other API providers can put to use.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud</strong> - Amazon forever changed the way we compute using APIs, proving that we could deploy essential global infrastructure like compute, storage and DNS using web APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - The final piece of the puzzle was the mobile computing device, ushered in by Apple with the iPhone, followed up by Google with Android, mobile phones will forever change how we interact, with APIs delivering the essential resources we need to make mobile possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, the 2014 API economy wouldn't be possible if APIs hadn&rsquo;t developed and evolved through these stages. Commerce, social, business, cloud, mobile are all essential to a thriving API economy. Sure there are other APIs in other genres that fill in the cracks, but these five areas are the pillars that not only showed that APIs are viable, but will also be the pillars that the API economy rests on from here forward.</p>
<p>As I track on the API space, I&rsquo;m trying to understand where we are at, and where we are going, hoping to identify the next phases of API history. I'm keeping an eye on trends like aggregation, realtime, data, baas, reciprocity, single page apps, Internet of things (IoT), and other areas trying to understand what is next. While I think IoT is definitely the most compelling and seems to be moving the fastest, I think we need to step back, and be careful not look at this through a technological lens.</p>
<p>I identified early on that this world of APIs wasn't going to be all about the tech. From an API provider, consumer or analyst viewpoint we should not only consider the technology of APIs, and remember that the business of APIs is essential to everything that happens. While I think there will be an incredible amount of innovation from startups when it comes to API deployment in new areas like real time and reciprocity, I think one of the phases we are in the middle of right now, is the enterprise phase.</p>
<p>In the last month I've talked with more fortune 500 companies about their API strategy, than any other group, well maybe the same as government (parallel phase?). I've talked with familiar enterprise players like AT&amp;T, but have also had conversations with newer entrants like Adobe.  There is always a place for startups to innovate with APIs, pushing us into new areas, but it is going to take the resources of the fortune 500 to truly make the API economy a reality when it comes to the global economy.</p>
<p>As I see it, all the phases I&rdquo;ve described don&rsquo;t happen one after another, they overlap and feed off each other, and much like we couldn't fully realize the potential of commerce, without cloud computing and mobile--I don't think the API economy will fully be realized until major companies have a solid API program, and working API strategy. As with other phases of API development, this won't all be good, I think there is a lot to be worked out at the city, state and federal level government levels, and important issues around the politics of APIs are growing more critical every day, but I still think the current shift by the enterprise towards APIs will be seen as a significant phase in the history of APIs, when we look back.</p>

<p>At <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> in San Francisco last October, we streamed the event online. We are considering doing this again for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php" target="_blank">#APIStrat in Amsterdam this March 26-28th</a>.</p>
<p>We had an inquiry from Australia, asking whether or not we planned to do this for Amsterdam, and they wanted to stream some of the event as part of their local API meetup--what a great idea!</p>
<p>So we wanted to put out the word and see if there are other API meetup groups that were interested in doing the same thing in their local area. If you are interested in streaming the event go ahead and ping me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> or email me at <a title="info@apievangelist.com" href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">info@apievangelist.com</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/baas-trends.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/">tracking on BaaS since 2011</a>, and identified it was an important layer of the API space, dedicated to serving up the resources that mobile developers were needing to be successful.  BaaS is all about creating meaningful stacks of API driven resources, allowing developers to build on top of a single backend, and not have to assemble their own from disparate open source tools, cloud service and individual API providers.</p>
<p>During 2012 I saw the momentum picking up around BaaS and made sure I included it in my monitoring of the API space, resulting in a <a href="https://gum.co/ngAa">BaaS white paper</a>, which I will be updating for 2014 to include recent shifts towards the enterprise. In February 2013, <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist also brought together <span>Ilya Sukhar (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasu">@ilyasu</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.parse.com/" target="_blank">Parse</a><span>, Morgan Bickle (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/morganbickle">@morganbickle</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.kinvey.com/" target="_blank">Kinvey</a><span>, Marc Weil (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/marcweil">@marcweil</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cloudmine.me/" target="_blank">Cloudmine</a><span>, Miko Matasumura (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/mikojava">@mikojava</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://kii.com/" target="_blank">Kii</a><span>, Ty Amell (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/tyamell">@tyamell</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.stackmob.com/" target="_blank">StackMob</a><span>&nbsp;James Tamplin (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jamestamplin">@jamestamplin</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> to talk about the fast growing BaaS space at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013NYC/">API Strategy &amp; Practice in NYC</a>&mdash;resulting in a pretty heated exchange between Ilya and Tye, which is ironic since these were the two acquisitions we saw in 2013 (<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Mobile-Back-end-Service">which I alluded to at the closing of the panel, but you will have to watch for yourself</a>).</p>
<p>Here we are in 2014, <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2013/04/25/welcoming-parse-to-facebook/">Parse has been acquired by Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://www.paypal-forward.com/leadership/paypal-welcomes-the-stackmob-team/">Stackmob has been acquired by Paypal</a>. While Parse is still functioning as a viable BaaS platform, we got the news this week that <a href="https://blog.stackmob.com/2014/02/stackmob-announcement/" target="_blank">Stackmob was shutting down as of May, no longer supporting developers</a>. I think Parse and Stackob are the poster children for amazing new resources that capture the attention of developers, and while not all of them go away when acquisitions occur, it is something developers have become all to familiar with, and need to build in their own operational plans.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can blame Stackmob for their decision, I&rsquo;m sure many of you entrepreneurs will be faced with the same decision when you reach your goal of acquisition, I don&rsquo;t think every exit will be as positive as Parse&rsquo;s was with Facebook&mdash;which seems more of a partnership than acquisition. I asked Sravish Sridhar (<a href="https://twitter.com/sravish">@sravish</a>), CEO of Kinvey to get his thoughts on the recent announcement from Stackmob:</p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;..all the initial BaaS vendors built compelling platforms with very useful features for mobile developers, however it's very difficult to create a sustainable and long-term business by just solving Backend issues for individual developers, especially with just Series-A funding, the market to build a business is with the enterprise. Those that couldn't make the transition have since been acquired. Now companies like Kinvey, AnyPresence and FeedHenry are maturing in the enterprise market.&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>This future of BaaS providers is pretty clear to me, with Kinvey&rsquo;s latest move to launch a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/13/kinvey-launches-dedicated-backend-as-a-service-platform-for-enterprise-developers" target="_blank">dedicated backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform for enterprise developers</a>. While we all have hopes that the world of open development will provide enough revenue to support the release of the best products and services, the money is with the enterprise&mdash;especially when you have accepted money from VC&rsquo;s, which is essential to delivering at scale, you will have to follow the money.</p>
<p>As with other <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">trends in the API space</a> like <a title="realtime apis" href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">real-time</a>, <a title="api reciprocity" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">reciprocity</a>, <a title="api aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">aggregation</a> and <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">voice</a>, we will see lots of innovation from newcomers, but as these sectors mature, winners will emerge, losers will go away, consolidation will occur&mdash;as a developer do you have this inevitable aspect of the tech world built into your operational plans?</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/02/14/jumpstarting-the-api-conversation-using-prototypes/">Jumpstarting The API Conversation Using Prototypes</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">14 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/ed/fafsa-form.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>For those of us who live and breathe APIs, it is easy to image what is possible when discussing an idea for an API, or what an API could to to transform an existing process or application&mdash;however for everyone else will often need something more to help them understand what is possible.  Often times it is these folks who are the decision makers behind whether an API will live or die, so it is critical to help them get up to speed.</p>
<p>In my experience there is no better way to jumpstart the conversation about what is possible around an API, than to just build a prototype, flushing out all aspect around an API resource. This is just what I recently did around the <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/">free financial student aid form</a>, from the Department of Education.</p>
<p>In November someone contacted me in government and told me how there had been a conversation around a potential API for the FAFSA form, but because of the usual undercurrents in government, the discussion had gone cold. My contacts in the federal government can&rsquo;t actually ask me to work on projects for free (and they didn't), but they can express their ideas of what "could be", then it is up to me if I want to help make this come true. This is one of the primary reason I left my own position in government as a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/meet-the-fellows">Presidential Innovation Fellow</a>, to give me more flexibility in designing and deployment projects, and also help federal agencies kickstart API initiatives from the outside-in.</p>
<p>During November and December I worked on <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/" target="_blank">a prototype for what the FAFSA API could be</a>, using my own approach to API project development, where I don&rsquo;t just design and develop the API, I tell the story of the process in real-time, publishing it all as a Github repository and site that anyone can follow, fork and put to use.  By 12/15 I had a <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/docs.html">handful of API endpoints including for reading and writing the FAFSA application, available fields, rejection codes, conditional procedures and for pulling states and universities</a> to support web and mobile application development.</p>
<p>In December I went to an education data jam in Palo Alto at Stanford, and supported another virtually that was held in Cambridge at Harvard, in an effort to push the existence of my API prototype, making people aware of what I was doing.  While there is still a lot of work to be done on prototype, I needed to add the most important ingredient that doesn't have anything to do with technology&mdash;I need to start a conversation around the potential of a FAFSA API within the education community.</p>
<p>While my FAFSA API prototype didn&rsquo;t generate code and applications I would like, I did start a conversation, and the resulting discussion and awareness around it help rekindle the conversation at the Department of Education. On January 15th at an education datapalooza in Washington DC that was looking to promote innovation in improving college access, affordability and completion the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-education-datapalooza-promote-innovation-improving-college-access-aff" target="_blank">Department of Education made an announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>The U.S. Department of Education will explore the use of Application Program Interfaces (APIs) as a way to help students and families access key education processes, programs, and data. The Department will issue a Request for Information (RFI) to gather ideas and feedback on potential development of APIs with key education data, programs, and frequently used forms&mdash;including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not taking full credit for this, everyone who participated in the conversation deserves credit, and while my prototype may not get any more time or resources to evolve the project forward, I still feel I accomplished my goal, which was not to develop a FAFSA API, or spawn an actual API ecosystem&mdash;it was to revive the conversation with the one group that should own the API deployment, the Department of Education.</p>
<p>When it comes to the business and politics of APIs there isn&rsquo;t always a clear path to follow when designing, deploying and finding success. Sometimes you have to develop prototypes and proof of concepts and get the conversation going, get key players to the table and then things will move forward in their own way.</p>

<p>Keynotes from Rackspace, Twitter, Runscope, and Absolut Vodka. Fireside with Tyler Singletary from Klout, Gordon Hollingworth of Software at Raspberry Pi, and Adam Duvander of SendGrid--with sessions on hypermedia, scalability, discovery, design and much, much more.</p>
<p>After successful events in New York City, and San Francisco, the momentum to Amsterdam is pretty exciting. 3Scale and I are thoroughly enjoying putting together the schedule which came together really fast, leaving us having to make some hard decisions on which talks to include, and which ones we had to decline.</p>
<p>There are still a handful of sponsorship opportunities available if your company would like to help support and participate in the conversation that is <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>.

The good news is I'm doing some interesting work that I'm able to pull stories from. This post is from a forum post I made on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/us-government-apis">US Government API forum</a> i frequent, which has some very interesting conversations about APIs in the federal government.</p>
<p>In a recent post from Brian over at <a href="http://dc3.mil/">DC3 (Defense Cyber Crime Center)</a>, an interesting question was asked:&nbsp;<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/us-government-apis/lsvsBHpPNlQ">Do US Government Web APIs Require System Interconnectivity Agreements?</a> I will let you visit the conversation and see more detail around his question, as well as some of the other responses, but here were some of my thoughts:</p>
<p><span>Web / http APIs do not fit earlier definitions of &ldquo;system interconnectivity agreements&rdquo;, which represents the technical and fundamental shift between network connections, SOAP APIs and this new world of web APIs.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>Web APIs were successful in part because of the loosely coupled nature of HTTP, leveraging a client / server and request / response. There is interconnectivity, but not the tight coupling and governance of previous network protocols and APIs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>APIs are the contract! Each API endpoint provides access to a resource, then with accompanying management building blocks, you dial in that contract.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>At the&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">API provider level</span></strong>, you can enforce / encourage interoperability using common web api approaches:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>API Definitions&nbsp;</strong>- Machine readable API definitions like&nbsp;<a href="https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger" target="_blank">Swagger</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://apiblueprint.org/" target="_blank">API Blueprint</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://raml.org/" target="_blank">RAML</a>&nbsp;can provide templates that enforce / encourage common blueprints that providers can follow when publishing APIs to centralized or decentralized API management platforms, establishing base contracts for interoperability, as well as underlying data models.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Terms of Use</strong>&nbsp;- Common terms of use can be established for management, allowing provides to contract their own TOS that is tailored for specific resources, but derived from common patterns. You see this emerging in private sector with&nbsp;<a href="http://apivoice.com/2013/12/16/api-terms-of-service-wizard-from-swedish-api-license/" target="_blank">Swedish API License</a></span><span>.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Licensing</strong>&nbsp;- Much like TOS, common licensing blueprints can be provided, allowing data and resource licensing to be tailored for resources, but pulled from existing licensing pools. Many API providers are providing a<a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/01/16/what-is-your-api-content-licensing-default/" target="_blank">&nbsp;base stack of licensing arrangements</a>&nbsp;that meet their needs as well as consumers.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Service Level Agreements (SLA)</strong>&nbsp;- Same as TOS, service level agreements can be forged allowing API providers to meet expectations of consumers. Some SLAs are loose and some are tight, depending on goals.</span></li>
<li><strong>Security</strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;- Common tooling and practices around the security of APIs need to be established, using common approaches like API Keys, oAuth, SSO and other common standards already in use. As with API interface patterns, data models, etc, each API provider&nbsp;should not&nbsp;be allowed to bring their home brew security to the table.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Service Composition</strong>&nbsp;- A practice referred to as &ldquo;service composition&rdquo; is a common part of all API management platforms currently available. Service composition allows API providers to build service tiers and compose products from API resources, establishing different levels of access and usage that can be designed for internal, partner or public access to resources. Ie. Service tier A allows read only access to APIs with specific rate limits, while service tier B allows read / write access with unlimited. Service composition reflects and extends the contract that an API is.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Analytics</strong>&nbsp;- Real-time metrics give API providers with living views into API registration and usage, allowing an organic view into how resources are truly being used, allowing for real-time adjustments, enforcements, and service level composition adjustments to be made. This will allow providers to respond to adverse conditions by tightening control and stimulate innovation by loosening control as needed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>All of these provider level building blocks work in concert to standardize design, deployment and management of common API resources. They provide a common backbone that make APIs a living contract, that is flexible enough to work with many different resources and agencies, without being too rigid&mdash;providing the ability to innovate, while still establishing desired levels of governance, which will vary from agency to agency and resource to resource.</span><br /><br /><span>At the&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">API consumer level</span></strong>, you can enforce / encourage interoperability using common web api approaches:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Portal</strong>&nbsp;- Each API will have one or many portals where you access the APIs and supporting documentation. The availability of a portal, whether its public or private can reflect access and interoperability goals for API providers. Portal availability is the gateway to interoperability enforcement / encouragement.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Registration</strong>&nbsp;- Even if you have access to an API resource, and it is publicly available, most APIs require registration to obtain required application keys or obtain necessary oAuth credentials. Registration can be self-service, invite only or require approval, providing all levels of enforcement / encouragement of agreements.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Security</strong>&nbsp;- Each API provider has designated appropriate API security levels derived from a common pool of tools and standards. Consumers are guided by API provider security standards, operate within API key restrictions, oAuth identity and access restrictions, and designated service composition frameworks that are linked to security access levels. Security is not just technology, it transcends business and politics of API interoperability.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Terms of Service</strong>&nbsp;- Every API consumer is bound by the API TOS at the point of registration, and will be legally required to agree / adhere to future changes.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Best Practices -</strong>&nbsp;Best practices provide a plain english explanation of legal TOS for all API consumers, ensuring that all API consumers truly execute on TOS that are set forth, cause you know, nobody reads TOS.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Service Level Agreements (SLA)</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;- Service Level Agreements can be extended to all API consumers as part of their service level composition, registration and TOS. SLAs provide necessary real-time expectations of system performance.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Analytics</strong>&nbsp;- Real-time metrics are provided to API consumers letting them know the reality of their &nbsp;API consumption, where they exist within service level agreements, service composition, and other aspects of API interoperability and agreements.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">All the building blocks listed above provide the two-sides of the web API coin. Modern API&nbsp;initiatives&nbsp;from Amazon, Google, Twitter and thousands of other companies are proving that loosely coupled,&nbsp;modular approaches to API design, deployment and management provide a flexible, agile approach to interoperability that&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;as rigid as classic API approaches or&nbsp;networking protocols.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;">All of these building blocks work in concert to orchestrate interoperability that protects the interest of API providers and consumers, and even 3rd party intermediaries. You even seen this approach to interoperability move from the technical, to meaningful reciprocity across providers, as&nbsp;we've&nbsp;seen with newer generation of automation providers like If This Then That and Zapier&mdash;building on legacy ETL concepts, but bringing into a new global, Internet era.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;">We have to establish case studies that will shift decision makers away from more rigid approaches. Without them we&nbsp;won't&nbsp;be able to achieve the flexibility that web APIs bring, and are left&nbsp;with a heavy handed Tech + Legal governance.</span><br /><br /><span>So to directly answer your questions:</span><br /><br /><span><strong>1) Do US Gov Web APIs *require* system interconnectivity agreements?&nbsp; Which policies and conditions?&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">NO!<br /></span><br /><span><strong>2) Can system interconnectivity agreements be mitigated to a common agreement instead of agency-specific? (i.e.&nbsp; single information sharing agreement, and/or Acceptable Use Policies, common Terms of Service per API provider )</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">YES!<br /></span><br /><span><strong>3) Which policies/guidance can be leveraged prevent the specific use of "system interconnectivity agreements" into the rest of the US Gov Web API space?</strong></span>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The patterns exist in private sector and are slowly emerging in government. We just need to work to identify, standardardized and establish the case studies we need to steer away from the&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;specific use of "system interconnectivity agreements".</span></div>

        <span class="post-date">13 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://info.cvscaremark.com/cvs-insights/cvs-quits" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/cvs-pharmacy/cvs_logo_large.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>At the same time I am processing the move by <a href="http://info.cvscaremark.com/cvs-insights/cvs-quits" target="_blank">CVS to stop selling tobacco products in their over 7,600 retailsstores</a>, making a commitment to being more retail healthcare, rather than just a corner drugstore&mdash;I am also wrapping my head around potential strategy and opportunities for the <a href="https://www.cashtie.com/" target="_blank">Cashtie API</a> which opens up the ability for mobile developers to accept cash payments at CVS retail locations.</p>
<p>I think CVS&rsquo;s commitment to their healthcare mission, by itself is a pretty significant move towards reinventing themselves, but adding to the news, the White House just announced that <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/02/07/leading-pharmacies-and-retailers-join-blue-button-initiative">CVS was onboard to work with standardizing patient prescription information as part of the Blue Button initiative</a>, which works to give citizens control over their healthcare data&mdash;further defining CVS as more than just a corner drugstore.</p>
<p>As the healthcare industry continues its adoption of APIs, smart-phone adoption increase, the quantified-self movement expands, and retail drugstores like CVS look to increase their relevance, I think we will see an entirely new retail healthcare landscape emerge. When you take this seismic healthcare shift and pair up with powerful API resources like the Cashtie API, which have the potential to allow the underbanked who have recently gained access to healthcare, pay their premiums with cash&mdash;we wiill see a serious shift in how healthcare is delivered, and consumed.</p>
<p>I am seeing APIs emerge in various aspects of the healthcare industry ranging from the next generation of <a href="http://www.practicefusion.com/labs-documentation/">electronic healthcare records (EHR)</a> to accessing vital <a href="https://www.eligibleapi.com/" target="_blank">health insurance information</a>, but I think the role APIs will play in  this emerging retail healthcare space will be pretty significant in changing how we consume, pay for and interact with our healthcare.  Any company that serves the healthcare industry that doesn&rsquo;t have an API, will not stay relevant in this new API driven healthcare economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google-plus/google-plus-hangouts.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I did a Google Hangout with the <a title="Cashtie API" href="http://bit.ly/1grzE1H">Cashtie API</a> development team this morning, which I thought was an interesting enough format to share with all of you. The Cashtie API team is a distributed team, between the corporate headquarters in Atlanta, Ukraine and Brazil. I&rsquo;m working on ways to help Cashtie with their API strategy, and wanted to get to know the team&mdash;what better way than using Google Hangout.</p>
<p>While the call started with an introduction to the team, my goal was to spend some time walking through the Cashtie API with them, showing what I see, as a newbie to the developer area. Since I am a developer, I know how easy it is to be too close to the code, and you can miss some obvious things that may confuse API developers you are targeting. I shared my desktop in the Google Hangout, then walked through what I saw on the homepage, what the on-boarding process was like, and worked my way through their developer area, discussing their approach to delivering a dashboard, account settings, support, blog, and other areas of their API strategy.</p>
<p>Alongside this walk-through I had other browser tabs open with the developer areas of Twilio, SendGrid, Gitub, and Stripe, comparing the <a title="API building blocks" href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks</a> these API leaders employ, with the building blocks the Cashtie team used. This really helps the team understand how other APIs, who potentially have more resources, and have been at this game longer, have deployed their own developer programs.</p>
<p>This type of Google Hangout is something I will do regularly with the <a title="Cashtie API" href="/admin/blog/Cashtie API">Cashtie API</a> team (maybe others), hoping to expand their horizon when it comes to API deployment, bringing them out of their developer silo. This is one of the biggest problems I encounter with API development teams as I make my evangelist rounds--developers are often entrenched with their views and practices, because they never really are forced out of their bubble. Most developers, once you help them see a larger picture, will improve their approach to delivering their APIs, developer area, setting a much better tone for API operations.</p>

<p>In the days before the Internet when you had access to a valuable business resource, you kept it to yourself as long as you possibly can, hoping to maximize the potential to your business, and limiting other businesses access to the same resource--if possible you secured some sort of exclusive deal.</p>
<p>In the age of the Internet, APIs have democratized access to extremely valuable resources, making them available to developers and businesses of all shapes and sizes. Resources like mapping from Google Maps, compute power from Amazon, and deployment of of phone numbers around the globe using Twilio, do not take millions of dollars and the negotiations of big deals, they are all accessible to anyone via web APIs.</p>
<p>Even with this wider access to resources, it doesn't mean yCou can&rsquo;t tell compelling stories about the resources your startup has, like the ability to map from anywhere in the world, unlimited scaling of server capactiy and telephone access points around the globe. If you are a savvy startup you will discover and aggregate the best of breed API resources, then build a business and application around these resources, then tell stories that impress.</p>
<p>The best example of this I&rsquo;ve seen recently is from <a href="http://www.paynearme.com/en" target="_blank">PayNearMe</a>, who has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/06/cash-based-payments-network-paynearme-raises-20m-series-e-expands-via-family-dollar-partnership/">leveraged their expansion using API driven resources, resulting in the securing of 20M in funding from GSV Capital</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>The expansion to Dollar Store by PayNearMe was done via the <a href="https://www.cashtie.com/">Cashtie API</a>, which gives you access to the point of sale systems at top retailers like Target, CVS and Dollar Stores. I&rsquo;m not saying that PayNearMe secured their 20M in funding exclusively based upon their expansion using Cashtie, but it did allow them to weave it nicely into their overall story, making for a nice investment for GSV Capital.</p>
<p>The growth in the number of high value API resources that are emerging, will provide the backbone of your technical operations, providing the resources you couldn&rsquo;t possibly develop on your own, but if you craft the right story around your API driven business, you can also leverage these API driven resources to secure the funding you need to take your startup vision to the next level.</p>

<p>In 2010 I made a deal with my girlfriend Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>), I&rsquo;d run the server infrastructure behind her blog <a title="Hack Education" href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>, and she&rsquo;d help me polish my storytelling on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>. Audrey studied folklore and storytelling as part of her masters degree, and I saw that the API space was desperately in need of some meaningful storytelling to help the fast growing space find its future&mdash;a perfect partnership!</p>
<p>The API space is full of conversations (and arguments) about the technological building blocks of the space, and saturated with pitches for the products and services across the industry, but the sector is often deficient in stories that help newbies understand APIs, and veterans grasp the big picture of where we are going. For us to understand the space as it grows, make sense of technologies like hypermedia, and evolve approaches for communicating around APIs using definitions like API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, we need stories&mdash;not press releases, not product pitches, we need stories that we can share and retell.</p>
<p>Every once in a while you see great stories from the occasional technologist or passionate evangelist stand out from the noise, but lately I&rsquo;m seeing more API leaders step up and deliberately craft meaningful stories that help us better understand the API universe. This week I&rsquo;ve seen two great stories emerge with <a href="http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/why-rest-is-more-like-religion-than-most-technologies/">Why REST is More Like Religion than Most Technologies</a>, from Mike Schinkel (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikeschinkel">@mikeschinkel</a>), and <a href="http://apiux.com/2014/02/06/dark-matter-api-universe/">Dark Matter in the API Universe</a> by Jason Harmon (<a href="https://twitter.com/jharmn">@jharmn</a>).</p>
<p>These stories aren&rsquo;t selling you on a specific technology or product, they are helping us understand the big picture, and tell us stories that help us understand a very complex space, which spans almost every business sector. These stories are critical to helping us all make sense of the API industry, and whether we acknowledge it or not, help lead us in a better direction, and even allow us to even laugh at ourselves from time to time.</p>
<p>Thank you to the API storytellers!</p>

<p>While it may seem obvious that you should ask your API developers what they want, many times this is a simple task that can get lost in the shuffle of API deployment and management. API Evangelist is all about sharing, simple stories that keep API providers informed of the best practices of API management&mdash;today's story comes from big data platform <a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>.</p>
<p>Splunk is <a href="http://splunkdev.uservoice.com/forums/235348-dev-platform">actively soliciting ideas from developers on where they think Splunk should take the platform</a>, asking questions like, should we invest in SDKs for mobile devices like IOS and Android, and should we be adding a new kind of charting to the web framework? To solicit the feedback, Splunk isn&rsquo;t getting fancy, they just <a href="http://splunkdev.uservoice.com/forums/235348-dev-platform">deployed a feedback area using UserVoice</a>&mdash;allowing developers to submit their own ideas, and vote up the ideas of other developers.</p>
<p>Splunk <a href="http://blogs.splunk.com/2014/01/28/help-us-grow-the-splunk-developer-platform-with-your-ideas-and-votes/">wrote up a blog post soliciting the feedback of the Splunk community</a>, which is something that you should do on a regular basis, not just at launch of your feedback area. Any API provider should be actively engaging their community, which will not just provide valuable feedback for the roadmap, it will bring you out of your bubble, forcing you to be closer with your developer ecosystem&mdash;which I believe is one of the healthiest side effects of an API way of life.</p>

        <p><a href="http://developer.marvel.com/" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/marvel-comics/marvel-avengers-logo.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reviewing the recently released <a href="http://developer.marvel.com/" target="_blank">Marvel Comic API</a>, because I&rsquo;m a comic book geek, wait no, because I&rsquo;m the API Evangelist&mdash;no wait it is both. Properly reviewing an API takes time because you need to spend time in the developers area, and actually go through the motions of hacking on an API. So far I&rsquo;ve registered, spent about 15 minutes looking around the documentation, and wrote a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/01/a-simple-honest-approach-to-getting-started-with-the-marvel-comics-api/">post on their getting started page</a>.</p>
<p>My friend Andreas Krohn (<a href="https://twitter.com/andreaskrohn">@andreaskrohn</a>) started by first reviewing the Marvel Comics API terms of use, which is the first thing any savvy developer should do, and he wrote up a great blogs post called, <a href="http://blog.dopter.se/post/75494422535/the-marvel-api-a-case-study-in-how-to-not-respect">The Marvel API - a case study in how to not respect developers</a>.  Andreas uncovers some pretty show-stopping aspects of the Marvel terms of use, &nbsp;including the fact that you can&rsquo;t generate any revenue from your applications built on the Marvel API, publish press releases about your work, and they reserve the right to take any idea you have, and keep for themselves. ;-(</p>
<p>Through a developer lens, these are pretty clear signals that an API provider is more concerned with their own interests, and don&rsquo;t care about developers success, and it is probably a good idea to steer clear of integrating with the platform. Through the lens of a major publisher who is first entering this scary new world of APIs, it starts to makes more sense.  This is why the terms of service is the single most important building block of any API--it doesn&rsquo;t matter how good your technical implementation of an API is, or how good your other building blocks like documentation are--if your TOS does not encourage innovation, developers will walk away.</p>
<p>Even with these extreme limitations placed on the TOS, I&rsquo;m still very optimistic for the Marvel API. I agree 100% with Andreas&rsquo;s analysis, but we also have to also celebrate that a major publisher like Marvel even being willing to play in the API game. I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/05/10/pearson-plans-api-platform-to-unlock-content/">watching Pearson iterate on their API for over three years now</a>, which reminds me that I should work with Andreas to do a deep dive on the Pearson TOS, and like the rest of us, Pearson is learning a lot along the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that we shouldn&rsquo;t critique the API initiatives of these companies. We should! They need to hear our feedback on every aspect of API operations, especially the terms of use, but we should also celebrate that they are even willing to put their cards on the table at all. We can&rsquo;t expect companies with major brand recognition, and deep history, to change overnight. As with the rest of us, Marvel will eventually learn to open up, give more control and opportunities to developers and better understand the benefits of a more &ldquo;open&rdquo; API program.</p>

<p>One of my biggest challenges at API Evangelist is keeping content accessible for people who have just come into the API space. The most successful aspect of my site is the blog, and while I try to keep all my writing targeted outside the developer community, it can be a lot of work to jump in and get up to speed on posts that are chronological.</p>
<p>It is really important to me, that people who are just learning about the space, or weekend API warriors can find the best resources across the space, not just on my blog&mdash;this is why I&rsquo;m super stoked about the new site from 3Scale called <a title="API Alchemy" href="http://apialchemy.3scale.net/">API Alchemy</a>.</p>
<p>API Alchemy is looking to curate the best of resources from the API space, providing curated links and commentary and access to the most influential authors across the world of APIs, in an easy to discover format.</p>
<p>API Alchemy isn&rsquo;t just for newbies either. Now when you are looking for <a href="https://plus.google.com/%2BRipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX">that kick-ass rant from Steve Yegge</a>, or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barack-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">Barack Obama Directs All Federal Agencies to Have an API</a> by that blowhard Kin Lane, you can find it in one place.</p>
<p>Now I have a place to publish the best of the best I find across the API space, and somewhere to send people of all skill levels&mdash;<a href="/admin/blog/API Alchemy">API Alchemy.</a>&nbsp;Nice work 3Scale team!</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-github.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>It is easy to think of <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> as a central repository for your open source code&mdash;most developers understand that. I have written before about the <a title="many ways to use Github as part of your API management strategy" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/08/api-management-using-github/">many ways to use Github as part of your API management strategy</a>, but in the last few months I'm really seeing Github playing more of a central role in the overall lifecycle of an API.</p>
<p><strong>API Presence</strong><br /><a title="Github Pages" href="http://pages.github.com/"> Github Pages</a> provides a very simple way for API providers to deploy public or private portals that can be a simple or elaborate doorway for developers to learn about and engage with APIs. A company can potentially have a single or multiple API portals, targeting a variety of potential consumers. You don't need a special website for your API anymore, just fire up a Github Page and get publishing the <a title="relevant building blocks your consumers will need" href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">relevant building blocks your consumers will need</a>.</p>
<p><strong>API Definition</strong><br /> As I continue to study the world of API definitions like API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, I'm increasingly finding API definitions published to Github, as well as employing it as a central storage for all my own API definitions. When 3Scale and API Evangelist designed <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, we allowed the publishing of API definitions to Github to be one of the ways you can include your API definition in the commons. By publishing your API definition on Github, either publicly or privately, you can provide a central definition of your API surface area, that can be versioned, forked, downloaded, and allow for contributions from other key players in your API ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>API Services</strong><br /> During my monitoring of the API space, I came across a new API monitoring service called <a href="http://autodevbot.com/">AutoDevBot</a>, which monitors all your API endpoints, and notifies you when something goes wrong. Pretty standard feature in a <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/companies.html">new wave of API integration tools and services</a> I&rsquo;m seeing emerge, but what is interesting is they use Github as a central place to store the settings for the API monitoring service. AutoDevBot has you clone their settings template, make changes you need to monitor your APIs, register and fire up AutoDevBot to monitor. Seems like a pretty simple way for API service providers to engage with API providers, allowing them to manage all the configuration for API services alongside their own internal API operations.</p>
<p><strong>API Source Code</strong><br /> Using Github as a central repository for server and client side code is not new, but using it as a central source for deploying, scaling and distribution of permanent or temporary instances of an API resource across various PaaS providers is. Allowing users to deploy cloud or on-premise instances of your API resources to Amazon Cloud Formations, Red Hat OpenShift or even Heroku, will define how we deploy and manage APIs in the future.</p>
<p><strong>API Feedback Loop</strong><br /> APIs are all about iterating, hopefully throughout the design, deployment, management, monetization, licensing and evangelism cycles, and Github provides a  perfect platform for managing the feedback loop for each of these iterations. Github issue and milestone manager is increasingly being used to manage feedback around the API design process, all source code, and will play a significant role in external API services, API definitions and the the overall presence of an API.</p>
<p>Github isn&rsquo;t just for server or client API code anymore. Git(hub) can play a central role in not just helping API providers manage a central definition of their API as it pertains to general operations, Github allows providers to interact with other service providers, as well as their API consumers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m intrigued by the many ways API and other service providers are putting Github to use, and will keep paying attention when I have time. I envision Github continuing its evolution as the backbone of public or private APIs, providing a central presence, definition, service integration point, feedback loop, as well source code repository for the thousands of API resources that are being deployed in the coming years.</p>

<p>It is easy to get excited about the potential around &ldquo;big data&rdquo;. Many individuals and companies feel this latest trend is all about offering up big data solutions with business models that are built around algorithms, that founders consider their &ldquo;secret sauce&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I don't have a problem with this, more power to you, however I personally feel big data solutions, especially those within government should be more transparent than many of the secret sauce, big data approaches we&rsquo;ve seen to date.</p>
<p>Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile</a>) has a great post at TechRepublic, called <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/data-driven-policy-and-commerce-requires-algorithmic-transparency/" target="_blank">data-driven policy and commerce requires algorithmic transparency</a>, which outlines this very well.  Alex uses the the phrase "algorithmic accountability&rdquo;, which I think sums all of this up very nicely.</p>
<p>When it comes to big data solutions, especially in the public sector, it is fine to collect large amounts of data, offer up analytics, visualizations and other big data tools, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">algorithmic accountability</span> is something that will be essential in moving forward and building trust across all indusries when it comes to big data.</p>

<p>I wrote about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/01/the-voice-chat-api-is-great-example-of-an-simple-open-api-driven-resource/">interesting approach by Plivo the other day around their Voice Chat API</a>, in which one thing they did really caught my eye, and reflects what I think is the future of APIs&mdash;the deployment of the API to Heroku.</p>
<p>This type of very modular, cloud deployment of fine grain APIs is something that I&rsquo;ve blogged about recently in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/modular-apis-driven-from-github-blueprints-using-openshift/">Modular APIs Driven From Github Blueprints Using OpenShift</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/20/server-side-api-templates-on-aws-cloud-formation-and-openshift/">Server Side API Templates On AWS Cloud Formation And OpenShift</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/12/caching-apis-with-cloudformations-or-openshift-/">Caching APIs With CloudFormations Or OpenShift</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the Voice Chat API, Plivo allows you to deploy an instance of the open source audio conference API to your own Heroku account. This is an interesting way to empower developers to deploy API resources, allowing them to allocate them within their preferred cloud environment, whether it is Heroku, Amazon, OpenShift from Redhat, or any other provider.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t investigated if there are any dependencies between the Voice Chat API and Plivo, but even with dependencies, this approach still holds a lot of promise. This gets us closer to some of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">earlier thoughts around virtual API stacks</a>, that allow us to build, manage and put to use the most meaningful stack of APIs possible for our applications&mdash;think b<a title="Backend As A Service" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">ackend as a service (BaaS),</a> but custom fit to exactly the resources we need.</p>

<p>A free, open-source, API driven conference solution called <a href="http://voicechatapi.com/">Voice Chat API</a> popped up on my API monitoring radar today, as I was going through my feeds. The Voice Chat API is a very cool, dead-simple conferencing solution. As a tool it provides clear value, and I really like the approach from <a href="https://plivo.com/">Plivo</a> to rollout out an open, API driven resource like this&mdash;a model that could be applied to other valuable resources.</p>
<p>What really stands out is the Voice Chat API does one thing and does it well&mdash;audio conferences. It is easy to tell what it does. We aren't having to convince users of a problem, then sell them on a solution. The problem is clear, the solution is simple.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source</strong><br /> The <a href="https://github.com/plivo/voicechat/">Voice Chat API is open source and available on Github</a>, built using "Plivo WebSDK and APIs&rdquo;. I haven&rsquo;t investigated the separation between what code is open source, and where the dependencies on Plivo is, but regardless the approach is interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Add-Ons</strong><br /> Providing users with more ways to deploy a conference, the Voice Chat API provides a set of add-ons including a <a href="https://github.com/dhfromkorea/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/voicechat.coffee/">Hubot Plugin</a>, that works in Campfire or Hipchat, a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/voice-chat/mmamadaodppejbaffaagddokjjekifoe">Chrome extension</a>, and a <a href="http://voicechatapi.com/create">bookmarklet for deploying a conference from any other browser</a>.</p>
<p><strong>API</strong><br /> The <a href="http://plivo.github.io/voicechat/">Voice Chat API centers around its API,&nbsp;</a>which allows developers to create a unique audio conference, the call mobile &amp; landline phone numbers (PSTN) into the bridge. The API deploys to your Heroku account, allowing you do manage your ad-hoc audio conference deployments in the cloud.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still playing around with the <a href="http://voicechatapi.com/">Voice Chat API</a>, understanding how the application and the API works, as well as considering how this new open source approach dovetails with Plivo's business model, but now I&rsquo;m intrigued which the approach, and how they crafted this API driven resource.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently reviewing the <a href="http://developer.marvel.com/">Marvel Comics API</a>, and their approach to making their rich content available via a simple web API.</p>
<p>They did a great job deploying the API. To start with they published very simple and honest getting started steps:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Sign Up</strong> - Get an API key</li>
<li><strong>Be A Good API Citizen </strong>- Read, understand, and abide by the terms of use for the Marvel Comics API</li>
<li><strong>Link Back </strong>- Observe the attribution and linking guidelines when displaying data from the API</li>
<li><strong>Keep In Touch -</strong> Tell us about what you're building and talk to other developers on our community page</li>
<li><strong>Build Cool Stuff!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I like their style. As a building block, getting started pages are pretty important, yet most API providers provide very dry, technical steps for on-boarding with an API&mdash;if at all.</p>
<p>The Marvel Comics API is a refreshing approach to explaining to developers how to get up and running with the API. Its nice to see from such a big brand.</p>

<p>As a proprietor of a small, successful niche blog, I can easily share some insight into why <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356?hl=en">Google recently started punishing blogs that have guest posts</a>.</p>
<p>At <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> I get about two offers a week from random companies and individuals asking to guest post on my blog. These people cite several reasons for wanting to do it, ranging from me helping them as an aspiring blogger, to them helping me with more content and traffic. If you know me, you know I don't have a problem producing content, and I do not blog because I give a shit about pageviews.</p>
<p>In addition to these smaller, much frequent requests for guest posting. I also get the occasional bigger company looking to &ldquo;partner&rdquo; with me, when in reality they have no desire to partner and generate value for my readers, or move my research forward. These conversations start out entertaining my perspective of partnering and bringing me value, but once I choose to dance with these partners, they almost always start getting heavy handed about me publishing what they want, and providing links to their own sites and content.</p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/thanks-for-offering-to-guest-blog-or-advertise-but%E2%80%A6/">Mike Schinkel has a great post on this very topic</a>, echoing much of what I&rsquo;m saying.  Mike is like me, he blogs for himself, not to generate pageviews. I started API Evangelist to help me better understand the API space, and while I do have a mission of also educating the masses about APIs, the primary directive is still about educating myself&mdash;without this none of it matters.</p>
<p>The reason Google has begun cracking down is because it is in their best interest to ensure blogs are of the highest quality, unique content possible. What these &ldquo;guest post farmers&rdquo;, and the enterprise companies that employ this same practice don't realize, is their aren&rsquo;t generating any value, they are extracting and diminishing the value of these blogs, and this is what has catching Google&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>On second thought, maybe these companies realize what they are doing. They are just leeches, looking to extract value for their purpose&mdash;at all costs. They don't care about your blog, content or career. They want to suck every last page view from your blogs soul, transferring any value you may have had to their operations.</p>

<p>I am working through some deeper research into the world of <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, and specifically into the world of API definitions. This research involves talking to each of the leading providers, crafting a series of stories along the way, resulting in a white paper that provides an overview of the space and possibly where things are going.</p>
<p>During my conversations with Tony Tam (<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>) of <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a>, creator of <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core">Swagger</a>, Jakub Nesetril (@jakubnesetril) and Z (<a href="https://twitter.com/zdne">@zdne</a>) of <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary</a>, creators of <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and Uri Sarid (<a href="https://twitter.com/usarid">@usarid</a>) of <a href="http://www.mulesoft.com/">Mulesoft</a>, creators of <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>, I asked a simple question:</p>
<p><strong>What is the vision behind  your API definition format?</strong></p>
<p>Resulting in a little insight behind each approach:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - The vision behind Swagger was not to make a company or to get people to use our service, it was strictly to solve a workflow problem. Initially the goal was centered around documentation and client tooling, but quickly realized it was much bigger, and became about managing the overall lifecycle of APIs.</li>
<li><strong>API Blueprint</strong> - API Blueprint is all about simplicity, and allowing people to have a structured conversation around an API, with the people who are actually going to be using it. Apiary is the conduit for this conversation, allowing developers to easily create a mock interface from the blueprint, share with consumers, and iterate as necessary.</li>
<li><strong>RAML</strong> - The motivation behind RAML was about seeking one source of truth, and a basic representation of an API. We used Swagger and API Blueprint, but neither fully met our vision. RAML was born, and is in alignment with Mulesoft's design first approach, and gave them the ability to design an API in a format that allowed them to sit down with stakeholders in a webinar and get instant feedback&mdash;bringing the API to forefront, not the implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are my summarizations of what Tony, Jakub, Z and Uri said in response to my question, not direct quotes. I think they get at the essence of why each company has invested so much in defining an API definition that delivers on their separate visions, and meets their goals</p>
<p>I also think there is a lot of overlap in these visions, as well as being in sync with where the overall demand in the API space is going. I don't endorse one solution over the other&mdash;I think each API designer will choose, and the fact there are multiple approaches is a good thing.</p>
<p>API definitions play a central role in my API design process, but in my personal approach, theAPI server and client code is regularly thrown away, where my API designs remain constant&mdash;something I work to iterate on, much like my writing.</p>
<p>Even with my personal passion for API definitions, I don't think they will be for everyone. I think API designers who find they deliver value in their work will use, while many successful API designers will have no use for them, and be just fine without them.</p>
<p>For some in 2014 API design will be about sharing, collaborating and communicating, in which API definitions will play a central role. For others the API implementation will be where the sharing, collaborating, communicating and ultimately the rubber meets the road.</p>
