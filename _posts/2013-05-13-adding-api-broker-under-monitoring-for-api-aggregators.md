{% include JB/setup %}<p>As Im monitoring the API space Im trying to create meaningful grouping for companies to belong when tracking API trends.My groupings are sometimes in alignment with what we hear in the tech blogosophere, but other times I try new definitions to help expand my monitoring definition and see if I can identify emerging patterns like Im seeing with BaaS.Each week I do a little more exploration in concept of API aggregation, and this week after studying payment API aggregator Spreedly, Im considering adding a new, overlapping area with aggregation, called API brokers.Lets see if I can make this work.API aggregators like Singly are providing personal data access to popular SaaS platforms by aggregating APIs.</p>
