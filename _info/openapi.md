The OpenAPI specification, formerly known as Swagger, gives you the ability to describe the surface area of your HTTP 1.1 APIs using JSON or YAML. OpenAPI provides a robust way to describe what is possible with each API, defining the surface area of each request and response.

OpenAPI isnâ€™t just for documentation or code generation. It is the standard business contract you apply to every digital resource you use in applications and integrations across the enterprise, providing teams with a common vocabulary to describe the relationship between API producers and consumers.
