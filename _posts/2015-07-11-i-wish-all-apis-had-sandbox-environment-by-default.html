<p><a href="https://angel.co/api">I am working through every endpoint of the AngelList API</a>, making sure I make as many successful calls as I can, as I work to generate Swagger definitions for the API, using Charles Proxy. To support this effort I setup each endpoint in Postman, and populate enough detail about an API to make a successful call--which I record through Charles, and then import to generate a semi-complete Swagger spec.</p>
<p>Some of the API endpoints requires adding and deleting of information. For example I will add a comment to my profile, then update in, and remove it, all in a series of API calls. Most of the time I can accomplish this without doing much damage to my live profile, but sometimes it requires sending messages to people, initiating processes that trigger other system aspects that I may not be able to undo.</p>
<p>As I'm playing with the AngelList Reservations API, which&nbsp;"are non-binding commitments to invest in a startup's current fundraising round", I can't help but think how nice a sandbox environment would be, as well as some dummy data to help me in my API journey. Some APIs I play with provide a sandbox environment, but I'd say it is not a common enough occurrence.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://getsandbox.com/">I'm seeing service emerge to cater to this need, as with Sandbox</a>, which is a service layer of the API lifecycle I think will only grow in coming months. I can see the need to create simple sandbox for any APIs as you are kicking tires, but I can also see the need for sophisticated simulation environments built on top of common APIs, allowing some apps to test out more advanced, and specialized scenarios.</p>
<p>If you need an example of this, <a href="https://www.carvoyant.com/">take a look at what Carvoyant is up to in the connected car realm</a>. While sandboxes, and simulations may not be as critical as in the world of cars, I think be critical for developers to build the next generation of web, mobile and IoT apps, and may not be something that every API provider can deliver on their own.</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)
