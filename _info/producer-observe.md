Observability provides teams with the ability to “see” APIs and the operations around them using a set of common metrics, helping provide the data needed to operate and move forward each API independently of others.

Observability is a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs. You need to tap into all the existing outputs available across the API platform and the infrastructure used to move APIs forward across the API life cycle into production. 

Because our infrastructure has APIs, we can use collections to define each aspect of API operations as a machine-readable, executable, and granular output that routes data into our APM solutions. That helps make 100% observability an achievable goal for your teams.
