Internal, partner, and public API portals are now common across the enterprise landscape, having been introduced as part of an earlier SOA investment, or more recently, as part of an API management investment. Portals play a critical role in onboarding  and engaging with users. But like other parts of the API life cycle, they are evolving, and often struggling to keep up with the changes happening across API operations. 

Portals are an established aspect of API operations and are making king incremental shifts to keep up with the pace of change across operations. These shifts are helping to deliver the experiences todayâ€™s consumers expect, reducing their time to first call and making sure they always have access to the latest and greatest experiences.
