        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/10/17/defining-oauth-scope-inline-within-the-api-documentation/">Defining OAuth Scope Inline Within The API Documentation</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">17 Oct 2016</span>
        <p>I am working on a project using the Youtube API, and came across their inline OAut 2.0 scopes, allowing you to explore what the API does as you are browsing the API docs. I am a huge fan of what interactive documentation like Swagger UI, and Apiary brought to the table, but I'm an even bigger fan of the creative ways people are evolving&nbsp;upon the concept, making learning about APIs a hands-on, interactive experience wherever possible.</p>
<p>To kick off my education of the YouTube API I started playing with <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list">the search endpoint for the Youtube Data API</a>. As I was playing with I noticed the had an API explorer allowing me to call the search method and see the live data.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_16_at_2.35.09_pm.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Once I clicked on the "Authorize requests using OAuth 2.0" slider I got a popup that gave me options for selecting OAuth 2.0s copes, that would be applied by the API explorer when I make API calls.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_16_at_2.34.01_pm.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The inline OAuth is simple, intuitive, and what I needed to define my API consumption, in line within the Youtube API documentation. I didn't have to write any code&nbsp;or jump through a bunch of classic OAuth hoops. It gves me what I need for OAuth, right in the documentation--simple OAuth is something you don't see very often.</p>
<p>I'm a supporter of more API documentation being an attractive static HTML layout like this, with little interactive modules embedded throughout the API docs. I'm also interested in seeing more web literacy being thrown in at this layer as well, <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">pulling common web concepts and specification details</a>, and providing popups, tooltips, and other inline API design learning opportunities.</p>
<p>I'm adding YouTube's approach to OAuth to my list of approaches to a modular approach to delivering interactive API documentation, for use in future storytelling.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/mermade/widdershins"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/widdershins_logo.png" alt="" width="25%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Someone turned me on to <a href="https://github.com/mermade/widdershins">an OpenAPI Spec to Slate / Shins compatible markdown converter on Github</a> this last week. I have been an advocate for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/25/we-should-be-generating-slate-from-swagger-so-we-maintain-a-machine-readable-core/">making sure we are still using machine readable API definitions for our API documentation, even if we are deploying the more attractive Slate</a>. I've been encouraging folks to develop an attractive option for API documentation driven by OpenAPI Spec for some time, so I am happy to add this converter to my <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com">API documentation research and toolbox</a>.</p>
<p>The OpenAPI Spec to markdown converter also introduced me to <a href="https://github.com/mermade/shins">a version of Slate that is ported to JavaScript / Node.js called Shins</a>. I'm going to add Shins to my API documentation research, and "widdershins" the OpenAPI Spec to markdown converter to my <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition research</a>. The auto-generation of attractive API documentation like Slate and Shins seems like a valid approach to getting things done, and worth including in my research.</p>
<p>I am increasingly publishing&nbsp;<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-evangelist/monitoring/gh-pages/_data/api-commons/runscope/account-api-openapi-spec.yaml">YAML editions of my OpenAPI Specs</a> which drive <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/apis/">API documentation that operates on Jekyll, using Liquid</a>. So I am all about having many different ways to skin the API documentation beast, allowing it to be easily deployed as part of any CI flow, and enabling the publishing of API docs for many different APIs, in many different developer portals or embedded on any device as part of IoT deployments. I think that a diverse range of approaches are optimal, as long as we do not lose our machine readable core.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/facebook_instagram_and_twitter_provided_data_access_for_a_surveillance_product_marketed_to_target_activists_of_color__american_civil_liberties_union.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-future/facebook-instagram-and-twitter-provided-data-access-surveillance-product-marketed">I was learning about&nbsp;Geofeedia providing law enforcement access to social media data from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram via their API(s) this week</a>. Geofeedia was making money by selling surveillance services to law enforcement build on top of these social APIs and is something that I guess Facebook and Instagram have cut-off access, but they could still have Twitter access through a reseller (Gnip?).&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This isn't something that will just go away. If law enforcement wants access to user's data on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, they are going to get it. I am guessing that the rules regarding what law enforcement can or can't do aren't clear (I will have to learn more), and something that is just left up to platforms to enforce via their terms of service. It is a problem that modern approaches to API authentication, management, and analytics are well designed to help make sense of--we just have to come up with a new layer defined specifically for law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span>Law enforcement should be able to fire up any standard, or customized solution they desire to search against social media data via APIs. However, they should be required to obtain an application key, and obtain the OAuth tokens that any other developer would need to. Rather than law enforcement being the customer of companies like Geofeedia, they should each get their own app id and keys, providing an identifying&nbsp;application that represents a specific law enforcement agency. They can still buy the software from providers, they just need the unique identifier when it comes to API consumption.</span></p>
<p><span>Along with this access, we also need to begin to define an auditable or regulatory layer, where other government agencies or 3rd party auditors can get access to the access logs for all applications registered to law enforcement&nbsp;agencies. A kind of real time FOIA access to the API management layer, allowing for a window into how law enforcement agencies are searching and putting social media data to use.</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, there will be special considerations regarding the OAuth interactions at play. At what point are end-users notified that their data is being accessed by law enforcement, and at what point do other government agencies and 3rd party auditors have access to API access to log file APIs for the law enforcement applications that are consuming Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other APIs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>There is a lot of work ahead to define how law enforcement can put social data to work via APIs, but the tools are there. Modern API infrastructure excels at this when done right. We can give law enforcement access to the data they need, while also enabling transparency in the process, making the platform operators like Twitter and Facebook feel better, while also respecting the privacy of US citizens. We need to just hammer out the OAuth scopes for these relationships similar to how we do it for <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/2014/05/14/the-future-of-public-private-sector-partnerships-being-negotiated-at-the-api-oauth-scope-level/">energy</a>, <a href="http://openid.bitbucket.org/HEART/openid-heart-fhir-oauth2.html">healthcare</a>, and other vital data being served up via APIs.</p>
<p><span>This is a problem that will keep popping up. We can't just rely on groups like ACLU to find the companies who are acting as brokers&nbsp;and waiting for the platforms to play whack a mole when these companies are singled out. We need a formal definition to guide how law enforcement&nbsp;is obtaining access to increasingly vital social media and network data via APIs. We need some transparency and consistency in the process, something that APIs do well when executed properly.</span></p>
<p><span>While it makes cringe think about. I predict that many companies will be required to have API access in the future--specifically for this purpose. My hope is that there is also some transparency and consistency baked into this approach, leverage what web APIs do best. Allowing law enforcement to get what they legally need, allowing other government agencies, watchdog groups, and journalist to get self-service, predefined access to understanding what law enforcement is up to when it comes to surveillance using online services.</span></p>
<p><span>I will spend more time on this subject. Mapping out how it might work across the top platform like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. I'm hoping that we can make some movement in this area before too many other episodes occur.</span></p>

<p>While spending some time going through my <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">API monitoring research</a> I found myself creating <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-evangelist/monitoring/gh-pages/_data/api-commons/datadog/apis.yaml">an OpenAPI spec and APIs.json&nbsp;index for the DataDog API</a>, and had the realization that this is the beginning of what I'm looking for when <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/23/who-is-going-to-do-the-devops-aggregation-api-platform/">I was talking about a DevOps aggregation API platform</a>. DataDog is just the monitoring layer of this vision I have, but it has many of the other elements I'm looking for.</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.datadoghq.com/api/">DataDog has all the monitoring elements present in their API platform</a>, and they have <a href="http://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/">all the platform integrations I'm envisioning in a DevOps aggregate API</a>. We just need the same thing for <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">virtualization</a>, <a href="http://serverless.apievangelist.com">serverless</a>, <a href="http://dns.apievangelist.com">DNS</a>, <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com">SDK</a>, <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com">documentation</a>, and the other <a href="http://apievangelist.com">critical stops along a modern API life cycle</a>.</p>
<p>I'll keep profiling the APIs for the service providers in my life cycle research&nbsp;until I get more of this DevOps aggregate API definition mapped out. Hopefully, I will stumble across other providers like DataDog who are doing such an interesting job with the choreography, and orchestration that will be needed to work across so many platforms. I appreciate API aggregation service providers who 1) have an API, and 2) share so much of the definition behind their work.</p>
<p>The next thing I will work on is profiling the metrics that DataDog has defined across the platforms they integrate with. <a href="http://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/awskinesis/">Take a look at the metrics they have defined for each integration</a>, there are some valuable patterns available in their work. I'd love to see a common set of API monitoring metrics emerge from across providers, something that if we standardize and share in a machine readable way, others will emulate--making&nbsp;interoperability much smoother when it comes to monitoring.</p>
<p>I just wanted to keep beating my drum about the fact that APIs aren't just about building applications, they are also critical to the API life cycle, and making sure there are stable, scalable APIs to build applications on top of in the first place.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/twitter_developers.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am working on profiling <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">the Twitter API</a> again, and I thought their stack of APIs have evolved significantly beyond what we tend to think of as the Twitter API, and was worth taking another look at. It is easy to think of Twitter API being about tweeting, friends, and following people, and #hashtags, but they have an interesting mix that I think tells its own story about Twitter's journey.</p>
<p>Here is the current Twitter API stack:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">Public REST API</a></strong> - The public REST APIs provide programmatic access to read and write the Twitter data -- what we think of when we talk about the Twitter API.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/media">Media API</a></strong> - The APi for managing photo, videos or animated GIFs, that are used by other Twitter API endpoints when tweeting, direct messaging, and others.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/collections">Collections API</a></strong> - The API for managing collections of tweets to tell specific stories, providing a single URL that represents each Twitter collection.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/ton">The TON (Twitter Object Nest) API</a></strong> - Allowing implementers to upload media and various assets to Twitter, allowing for resumable, and single file uploads.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/curator">Curator API</a></strong> - Provides broadcasters their curator-created streams for on-air graphics systems, or other digital displays.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview">Streaming APIs</a></strong> - Deliver new responses to REST API queries over a long-lived HTTP connection, providing a regular stream of tweets from the platform.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/ads/overview">Ads API </a></strong>- The Ads API gives partners a way to integrate Twitter advertising management in their product. Selected partners have the ability create their own tools to manage Twitter Ad campaigns while easily integrating into existing, cross-channel advertising management solutions.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.gnip.com/">Gnip</a></strong> -&nbsp;<span>Gnip is Twitter&rsquo;s enterprise API platform, delivering real-time and historical Twitter firehose data for large use applications.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>It is interesting to think about Twitter's long API evolution that got them here. I hear people often reference Twitter as the most extreme example of a public API out there. Granted, it is definitely the original example and has a very public element to it, but it also has several APIs that require partner status&nbsp;or special permissions to access, with the documentation available publicly--pushing back on the Twitter stereotype often used when we discuss APIs.</p>
<p>While most API providers will never reach Twitter scale, I think there are lessons in growth present here. That you don't always have to be 100% public, that you'll probably need streaming and higher volume solutions, including sensible handling of heavy media objects like images and video, as well as make money--do not forget to make money. It makes me sad that monetization on the Twitter platform is all about advertising, a huge missed opportunity for them in my opinion, but the advertising API is still worth documenting alongside the others.</p>
<p>Ok, that concludes my fresh look at the Twitter API stack. I'm going through each of them and documenting all available endpoints&nbsp;while profiling their current approach to the business of API operations. I figured that I better document everything before they get purchased by someone for Christmas. I haven't heard back on my offer yet, so I' guessing I was outbid. ;-)</p>

<p id="24c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was reading the <a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/hard-questions-about-bot-ethics-4f80797e34f0#.6615uvn7q">hard questions on bot ethics from Slack</a>, and their thoughts on bot advertising grabbed my attention. Trying to understand how bots will be monetizing things has been something I'm learning about, so I found Slack's post rather timely, and relevant to this fast growing layer of the API world.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here was Slack's view on advertising with bots by developers:</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A bot should not serve ads unless it has a strong, expressed purpose that benefits the user in doing so, and even then only on B2C platforms. I would hate to see bots becoming the new tracking pixel. Bots should not be prompting users to click on things and buy things unless explicitly asked to do so.</em></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They continue by adding that, <em>"ads in apps are against the&nbsp;<a href="https://api.slack.com/">Slack API</a>&nbsp;terms of service, and that makes me rather proud"</em>. I'm hoping that the Slack's business model is solid enough that they'll never need to consider bot advertising. I think it is an interesting constraint upon the community, and one that I'm curious how they'll work around when it comes to making money with bots. Could we be looking at a post-advertising world, when it comes to generating revenue?</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From what I can tell, bot monetization will either be about mining data from users,&nbsp;paying for premium features, or a little of both. I'm still a few weeks off from having more examples of how the bots are generating revenue, but I wanted to make sure I recorded Slack's stance on the subject, for reference in future work.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_13_at_9.17.46_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>One request I get from folks on a regular basis, is an example of file upload APIs. Each time I get one of these requests I regret that I do not have more file upload and storage APIs profiled, allowing me to share a list of examples. So file upload APIs are high on my list to keep an eye out for as I'm doing my regular monitoring and mapping of the API universe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An API I wanted to add to this list was <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/ton">the&nbsp;TON (Twitter Object Nest) API</a>, which "allows implementers to upload media and various assets to Twitter".&nbsp;The TON API is an interesting model for me because it supports resumable, and non-resumable uploads--with all files over 64MB required to be resumable. I wanted to profile the API in a story, and add some of the key aspects to my research on file upload APIs, so that I could reference in future conversations.</p>
<p>Some of the core features of how the TON API operates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Content-Type of requests cannot be application/x-www-form-urlencoded.</li>
<li>The Content-Type of requests&nbsp;are&nbsp;a valid media type as defined by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml">IANA</a>.</li>
<li>Chunks should be in integer multiples of X-TON-Min-Chunk-Size (except the last).</li>
<li>The Location header after upload needs to be saved to be used in other Twitter API calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the basic makeup of the initial request to kick off a resumable upload:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authorization: See 3-legged authorization</li>
<li>Content-Length: Set to 0</li>
<li>Content-Type: The Content-Type of the asset to be uploaded.</li>
<li>X-TON-Content-Type: Identical to Content-Type</li>
<li>X-TON-Content-Length: Total number of bytes of the asset to be uploaded</li>
</ul>
<p>The initialization response contains a Location which can then be used in other calls to the Twitter API. After you make the resumable upload initialization call, you can make each of the follow-up chunk uploads for the file--here is an example resumable video upload request:</p>
<ul>
<li>PUT /1.1/ton/bucket/{bucket}/SzFxGfAg_Zj.mp4?resumable=true&amp;resumeId=28401873 HTTP/1.1</li>
<li>Authorization: // oAuth1.0a (3-legged) details here</li>
<li>Content-Type: video/mp4</li>
<li>Content-Length: {number of bytes transferred in this request}</li>
<li>Content-Range: bytes {starting position, inclusive, 0-indexed}-{end position, inclusive}/{total content length}</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything under 64MB in size can just be done in <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/ton/single-chunk">a single chunk</a>. Next, I'm going to create an OpenAPI Spec for <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/ton">the Twitter TON API</a>, and hack together a simple server side edition of it in PHP, just so I can play with a complete example, in a sandbox environment. I will play with the Twitter TON API as well, and get familiar with how it works in relationship to the rest of the Twitter API.</p>
<p>Once I profile the file upload APIs for a couple of other providers I will add as a single area of my API stack research. I'm hoping to establish a common set of design patterns that I can point people to when designing their own file upload APIs, providing a single repository of API definition patterns that anyone can fork and put to use.</p>

<p>We like to talk about the API economy in this space. It is kind of the grand dream of API obsessed, that helps us articulate how big of a deal we think APIs are going to be. We know APIs are going to be big, but in reality, the impact most APIs make don't size up. This is one of the reasons I'm such a big support of APIs in the public sector, as the potential for a positive impact tends to be greater in my opinion.</p>
<p>One of the APIs that has the potential to contribute at the API economy scale is out of a partnership between the Department of Labor and the University of Chicago--the <a href="http://www.dataatwork.org/">DataAtWork Open Skills API</a>. Providing "a complete and standard data store for canonical and emerging skills, knowledge, abilities, tools, technologies, and how they relate to jobs". Opening up a pretty useful API from their collaborative work to "<span>map the DNA or genome of the U.S. labor market."</span></p>
<p><a href="http://api.dataatwork.org/v1/spec/">The Open Skills API uses Swagger UI for the documentation</a>, which always makes me happy because it means there is <a href="http://api.dataatwork.org/v1/spec/skills-api.json">an OpenAPI Spec behind</a>, for use in <a href="http://getpostman.com">Postman</a>, <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a>, and other API solutions. It's a simple, open API, that has some serious potential for use in web, and mobile apps, as well as visualizations, analysis, and other types of applications--making it worthy to add the APIs in my list that I think could actually make an impact at API economy scale.</p>

<p>My friend Jordan Walsh (<a href="https://twitter.com/jordwalsh">@jordwalsh</a>) just <a href="https://jordwalsh.com/2016/10/10/swagger-gist-io-saving-and-versioning-swagger-definitions/">released a new take on the Swagger editor</a>, that inches closer to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/19/my-dream-api-sketchbook-and-portfolio/">my vision of a dream API sketchbook and portfolio</a>. His&nbsp;<a href="http://swagger-gist.io">swagger-gist.io tool</a> allows you to open and save your API definitions to Github Gists, allowing you to use the snippet sharing solution to manage your API definitions, and their evolution.</p>
<p>While it isn't my entire vision for an API sketchbook and portfolio, swagger-gist.io's usage of Github Gists is a move in the right direction. This is just the first draft of his&nbsp;tool, and it looks like he plans on building in more of the API definition management features I am looking for--leveraging Github Gists as the book, in my sketchbook definition. #Creative</p>
<p>I like this model, especially when it comes to collaboration and storytelling around the API design process. I could see offering more sharing features for API definitions within the editor, enabling you to email, Slack, and share throughout an API's life cycle. I can also see more copy and paste opportunities, embedding API definitions using Github Gists in blog, knowledge base, and forum posts--grabbing the embed code from within the editor.</p>
<p>I'm curious to see where Jordan takes it. I have lots of ideas, but will just keep an eye on his work. My only critique at the moment is to not couple the functionality too tightly with the word "Swagger", as that is a trademarked product. I recommend relying on "OpenAPI Spec" or even better, some other way of identifying Gists that contain an OpenAPI Spec definition. ;-)</p>
<p>Cool stuff Jordan, keep up the good work.</p>

<p>I'm following along as the Sunlight Foundation winds down their operations and gathering any lessons along the way, that can help&nbsp;us open data and transparency folks can learn from as we do our work. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/23/learning-from-the-sunlight-foundation-situation-and-baking-transparency-into-projects/">I wrote earlier that we should be learning from the Sunlight Foundation situation and that we are making sure we bake transparency into our projects</a>&nbsp;and wanted to continue to extract wisdom we can reuse as they turn out the lights.</p>
<p>The Sunlight Foundation <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/10/04/github-and-internet-archive-helping-to-preserve-the-sunlight/">shared that they are working with the Internet Archive and Github to preserve their projects</a>, and that they are "trying to ensure the open source community can understand and use our projects in the future" by:</p>
<ul>
<li>adding documentation</li>
<li>standardizing licenses&nbsp;</li>
<li>scrubbing sensitive info</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the benefits of being transparent and open by default is that you tend&nbsp;to do all of this in real-time. If you are in the business of opening up data, making it accessible with open APIs, you should be using Github, documenting, and telling the story as you go along. Then you do not have to do it all when you are walking away--everything is open by default.</p>
<p>This is why I work out in the open on Github each day, it allows people to take my tools like <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/csv-converter">the CSV Converter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack">the API Stack</a>, and put them to work, even as I'm still evolving them. When I step away from a project, it can continue to live on with all the code, definitions, schema, data, licensing, and the story behind in a nice forkable package--no extra work necessary.</p>
<p>Anyways, just a couple of nuggets to consider as we are working on open data and API project across the space.</p>

<p>I was learning about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/verizon-to-start-selling-wireless-data-plans-for-drones-1475774573">Verizon starting to sell wireless data plans for drones in the Wall Street Journal</a>, as part of my research on what could be a drone API stack. As an Internet of Things (IoT)&nbsp;concept, I find drones fascinating because they can have so many dimensions of APIs at play. The drone, its camera, battery, and other components can have APIs. They can publish video to Youtube, Facebook via APIs. They can receive real-time updates about weather, fire, infrastructure, and other changing events via APIs. This post is about thinking through about network API layer when it comes to drones.</p>
<p>If we are going to be rolling out networks for specific devices like drones, automobiles, and other IoT devices, it seems like every object should have an API, including the underlying network itself. As I wade through <a href="http://network.apievangelist.com/organizations/">the different companies in my network API research</a> and learn about <a href="http://api.openswitch.net/rest/dist/index.html">the myriad of ways web APIs are being exposed at the network level</a>, I am left thinking about the programmability of the network in service of specific devices like this, and what this will mean for net neutrality.</p>
<p>Let's take that to another level. What happens when drones can be programmed to fly around and either be the network, or program the network? This is what captivates&nbsp;me about drones and APIs. It all breaks me free from thinking about APIs from just a provider and consumer dimensions&nbsp;and blurs all the lines. I know that Verizon is just reselling its existing network to a new type of device ($$$), but I think the potential with rolling out networks for IoT devices will be in making sure it is also programmable, along with every object that is connected.</p>
<p>All of this opens up some really interesting security concerns&nbsp;when you have so many dimensions of the physical and virtual world possessing APIs. Drones with APIs, flying around providing and consuming APIs, redefining its own network with an API--it is a recipe for pure API mayhem. ;-) Well, for now, I'll add the reference for drone specific networks to my research, and keep my eye out for other device specific networks like this--maybe as I continue to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/18/expanding-my-awareness-of-how-apis-are-being-used-at-the-network-level/">push my understanding of software defined networks</a> forward, I can further&nbsp;merge the concepts more.</p>

<p>While I still see a steady uptick in the number of hypermedia APIs out there in the wild, as well as conversations around the different media types that are available, I think we severely underestimated the time it would take for the average API developer to absorb and accept the concept. When you are immersed in any of the leading formats, from HAL to Siren, and you have the aha moment about why hypermedia makes sense, it can be easy to think everyone will see the future like we do. When in reality, I just don't think people are always seeking the wisdom in the same way, they are often just looking to get the job done.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of work to become hypermedia literate. An investment, not everyone can afford. While I am seeing more APIs employ hypermedia I have not seen an increase in the tooling and definitions we need to help developers speed up their understanding--providing examples they can reverse engineer. <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren is my hypermedia format</a> of choice&nbsp;and I found that <span>the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://developers.wurl.com/">TV and streaming video API platform Wurl</a>&nbsp;gave me a strong example to reverse engineer&nbsp;and learn from in my own journey.</p>
<p>Maybe not everyone learns like I do, but I can't help but feel like people need more common examples to learn from. I will spend some time going through <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/apis/">the hypermedia APIs I've included in my research</a>, and generalize some of the design patterns that are present and publish them as simple examples on Github. I need to refresh my own hypermedia skills, as I dive back <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/12/02/realizing-i-need-hypermedia-to-bring-my-api-lifecycle-vision-to-life/">into my subway map API design</a>, which uses Siren as an enabler of the journey. It will also give me some good stories here on the blog--hypermedia is always an evergreen driver of users, as they Google for things in their hypermedia journey.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/webform/request-information-regarding-data-portability">The White House is looking for our thoughts on data portability</a>. While it is the U.S. federal government asking for our thoughts, something that could apply to our tax returns, veterans records, or student loan information. They seem to be most interested in what data portability means to us as consumers, or via many online services today--as the product.</p>
<p>Here is what they are looking for:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is interested in understanding the benefits and drawbacks of increased data portability as well as potential policy avenues to achieve greater data portability. The views of the American people, including stakeholders such as consumers, academic and industry researchers, and private companies, are important to inform an understanding of these questions.</em></p>
<p>They want our input in 5000 words or less by&nbsp;<span>November 23, 2016. I am going to gather my own thoughts on data portability, and publish to API Evangelist, as well as submit via their RFI form. This is an extremely important topic&nbsp;and one I'm glad to see the White House picking up, and fingers crossed, will be moving forward in a consumer-centered way.</span></p>
<p><span>While I feel government open data is a critical piece of the puzzle, I think data literacy amongst consumer is just as critical. Data is what is fueling the tech sector, and in most scenarios, it is our personal data. The more control we have over this data, the better off we will be. The more opportunities we have to store locally, and migrate where we need to, the more data literate we will all be.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyways, I'll save my thoughts for my own response for the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/webform/request-information-regarding-data-portability">White House data portability RFI</a>. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the subject, if you want to post to your blog, or share with me via email.</span></p>

<li><strong>Username / Password - </strong>Default passwords for devices aren't changed, or the settings of unique passwords are not enforced. This makes it pretty easy to get right into the most common devices, after learning the default configuration.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play">Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)</a> - </strong>Increased usage of UPnP for the discovery and default opening up of networks to support device communication and monitoring. Often doing so without much consideration for security, and the bigger picture, serving the specific needs of a company and a single device.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Telnet/SSH_and_the_Command_Line">Telnet / SSH</a> - </strong>Even if one changes the password on the device&rsquo;s Web interface, the same default credentials may still allow remote users to log in to the device using telnet and/or SSH--providing a separate doorway for manufacturers, developers, and hackers to gain control over a device.</li>
<li><strong>Firmware Upgrades - </strong>A device may have had a patch released, but the actual firmware for a device has not actually been updated. The ease of installation, discover and access to the Internet, allows devices to be more easily installed by average folks unaware of wider security concerns, and the fact that devices&nbsp;will need to be updated regularly.</li>
</ul>
<p>While none of these areas speak directly to APIs, they definitely speak to some of the similar ways in which API security are compromised, and I think are also aspects of device operations that might be assisted, or improved upon with APIs. Right now I'm just adding this as security considerations for Internet of Things (IoT) implementations, but will also be keeping an eye out for any further role that APIs are playing in this type of attack, as well as the follow-up analysis.</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/who-makes-the-iot-things-under-attack/">Brian Krebs provides a wealth of insight into the attack</a>, as well as the multiple other reports I've read. Krebs provided a <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IoTbadpass-Sheet1.csv">CSV of the devices that had compromised passwords</a>, something I am going to add the company URL and logo, as well as more product information to. This will help me learn more about the products contributing to the mayhem, as well as the companies behind them. After that, I will put some more thought into how APIs can be put to work helping make sense of this growing problem--if nothing else we can just use them to make the forensic&nbsp;details of each attack available online, so we can sift through the wreckage easier with each future event.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/google_developer_agency_program.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was doing some research on how API providers are providing certification of their developers. I want to better understand how leading API providers are developing curriculum for certifying that developers have the skills needed to integrate with their API, and how API providers are also showcasing these certified developers.</p>
<p>As I was looking through various API programs I came across <a href="https://developers.google.com/agency/">Google's Developers Agency Program</a>, where they certify companies as competent to work with Google's APIs when developing Android applications. Google provides <a href="https://developers.google.com/agency/resources/">an eBook to help provide agencies with the resources they need to get certified</a>, the <a href="https://developers.google.com/agency/certification/">details on how to get certified</a>, as well as <a href="https://developers.google.com/agency/directory/">a page showcasing the agencies that have been certified</a>. I came across the program through a press release from one of the agencies, tooting their horn about being a Google certified agency.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/google_developers_agency_program_google_developers.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Google's agency certification got me thinking about how this can apply to the average API provider. While API providers might not have the resources to provide an agency certification program like Google does, it might make sense to at least establish relationships with a handful of agencies, and showcase them as part of API operations. Having some pre-certified, ready to go, agency level development resources that can tackle API integrations seems like a good idea for any size API provider.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/18/how-are-dev-shops-in-chicago-using-apis-a-talk-with-bryson-pouw-at-blaze-portfolio/">I've had conversations with agencies before, discussing which APIs they put to use</a>, and they tend to be either commerce related, or social integrations with Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This is something I'd like to explore further. I would also like to continue looking for examples of how API providers certify and showcase development resources, whether they are individual, or agency focused like Google is doing. I'm thinking that investment in API expertise at the agency level is one of the areas that will need a lot more attention as the world of APIs continues to expand and evolve.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/base_drone_screenshot.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Now that I have API Evangelist fired back up I am spending more time with my drones, working to understand the role APIs can play in the booming industry. I have been studying how companies like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/05/airmap-is-positioning-itself-to-be-a-critical-api-broker-for-the-drone-industry/">Airmap are working to be API brokers for the drone industry</a>, and how <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/02/direct-government-connection-into-internet-of-things-devices-like-we-are-seeing-with-drones/">government open data and APIs are being injected into the personal and commercial drone experience</a>. I want to continue this exploration, and learn more about how companies are injecting data, content, and other algorithmic resources into this experience, and brainstorm some other approaches to augmenting the world of drones with API resources.</p>
<p>As part of my regular monitoring of the space, I am tuned into many of the examples of how drones are being used. Many of them are pretty unrealistic, but some of them have real world usage, like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.suasnews.com/2016/10/drones-augmented-reality-powerful-tools-disaster-strikes/">disaster relief</a>. Think about the potential when you being to feed in vital data about local infrastructure pulled from city open data, or maybe household data from census data. This is where augmenting the drone experience begins to get interesting for me, going beyond just telling me where I can or cannot fly.</p>
<p>I fly a DJI Phantom 3 Professional drone (<a href="http://www.dji.com/mavic">I am eyeballing that Mavic</a>), and my drone experience is primarily through <a href="http://www.dji.com/">the DJI Go iPad application</a>, making API integration a pretty straightforward concept. My flight plan, and the latitude, longitude, elevation, and direction is shared via APIs in real-time (if there is an Internet connection), and I can share live-stream of the video to Youtube and Facebook via APIs. I also get regular updates about the flight condition, warnings of airports, forest fires, and other activity via the app--this is just the beginning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to explore what is next for APIs, based on what I am seeing emerge across the drone sector. I'm taking a series of screenshots of the DJI Go app and turn it into a transparent augmented reality template that I can use to explore what is possible. I have a number of drone scenarios that I can't replicate in the real world and need a simulation environment where I can think through examples like the disaster relief one above, or in some of the agricultural and industrial scenarios I'm reading about in the news.</p>
<p>I'm underwhelmed by most of what I'm seeing when it comes to the Internet of Things, but the world of drones fascinates me. Partly due to <a href="http://dronerecovery.org">my experiences this summer</a>, but also because of the seemingly unlimited ways in which they are being to put use. Much of it worries me, but like many of the other ways I see API being put to use, I am just trying to understand and be aware, and once this evolves, maybe I can lend my perspective on how we can help strike a more healthy balance across the industries they are impacting.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2016/10/embedded-reviews-at-yelp.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_10_at_8.08.25_pm.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2016/10/embedded-reviews-at-yelp.html">Yelp has shared some of the wisdom behind how they design, deploy, and operate their embeddable reviews</a>. I like it when leading API providers share the story behind their tooling like this. This type of storytelling generates SEO for their API, educates their API consumers, and provides educational resources for other API providers (and content for analysts like me).</p>
<p>So, what makes for a good embeddable widget, according to Yelp?</p>
<ul>
<li>a minimal amount of HTML code&nbsp;</li>
<li>a consistent &amp; responsive design</li>
<li>stay up-to-date with contextual information</li>
<li>load fast &amp; gracefully handle traffic spikes</li>
<li>record accurate analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>Yelp shares a little bit about the technical approach to achieving their definition of a good embeddable widget, which "are served as Yelp pages within iframes, adhere to the Yelp Styleguide, and show the most up-to-date review":</p>
<ul>
<li>iframe embeds allow for a simpler widgets.js</li>
<li>iframe embeds make development easier</li>
<li>iframe embeds can take advantage of HTML caching</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I've heard about lightening the load for your JavaScript, and the ease of embeddability before, from other providers. I hadn't thought about the cache-ability of using iframes before. It makes sense, allowing the user's browser to carry more of the load. They close up the post with some more interesting insight into the architectural decisions behind their embeddable(s):</p>
<ul>
<li>The embed HTML snippet consists of unstyled and empty elements so that the HTML snippet is minimal and durable.</li>
<li>We use a controller loaded via script tag to create and load iframes. The controller consists of pure JavaScript and doesn&rsquo;t use any libraries. The controller communicates with the iframes using postMessage.</li>
<li>We use a Google Analytics iframe served by Yelp to handle sending events for multiple review widget iframes on a single page. Resources served by Yelp, such as the controller and the iframes are either cached or served via CDN.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of Google Analytics is another interesting aspect that I hadn't considered. It gets me thinking about what other examples are there regarding the usage Google Analytics for a tracking layer within API clients. How is Yelp layering this into their wider Google Analytics strategy? Inversely how is Google possibly expanding Google Analytics for tracking of clients beyond straightforward web consumption? All things I need to get more up to speed on.</p>
<p>Yelp's story provides me with a number great nuggets for adding to my <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">API Embeddable research</a>. It also overlaps nicely with my <a href="http://analysis.apievangelist.com/">API analysis&nbsp;research</a>&nbsp;and even some of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/04/increased-analytics-at-the-api-client-and-sdk-level/">my recent thoughts on the expanding analytics layer for other API clients and SDKs</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://zapier.com/blog/push-by-zapier-google-chrome-extension/">Zapier is up to more good things with the launch of Push by Zapier</a>, allowing you to trigger API driven events from your browser. The new Chrome browser extension lets anyone, even non-developers to trigger the functionality of over 700 apps from the browser toolbar--further expanding the definition of how APIs can be put to work.</p>
<p>Allowing users to trigger API functionality from the browser adds an empowering dimension to the API conversation for non-developers. It allows the average user to access the features of any SaaS platform with an API, in their default environment--the browser. It allows the user to define, and queue up the API driven events that matter to them, where they operate the most. Zapier gave non-developers access to orchestrate the integration between the platforms they depend on, and Push by Zapier gives them even more granular level control over this world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the API driven events Zapier highlights in their release are:</p>
<p><a href="https://zapier.com/blog/push-by-zapier-google-chrome-extension/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/push_by_zapier.gif" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Add Tasks to Your To-Do List</li>
<li>Send an Email or SMS to a Specific Person</li>
<li>Crunch Numbers and Calculate Payments</li>
<li>Copy Data from an Unsupported Site or App and Add It to a Zapier Workflow</li>
<li>Create Invoices with a Click</li>
<li>Send Documents to be Signed</li>
<li>Create a New Project or Folder</li>
<li>Impersonate a Slack Bot</li>
<li>Look Up Data and Use It in a Workflow</li>
<li>Get Details from Your CRM Delivered Anywhere</li>
<li>Translate Text</li>
<li>Send Sales and Onboarding Emails to Potential or New Customers</li>
<li>Set a Reminder for Yourself</li>
<li>Create a Templated Document</li>
<li>Push a Button to Build a Report or Pull Statistics</li>
</ul>
<p>All very business-centric, API-driven functionality. That is what I like about what Zapier enables. They provide meaningful API-driven functionality for the average business user, and Push just gives them another way to define what this functionality is, and when it gets executed. This transcends&nbsp;just the features and functionality that each API platform offers, it also is about end-users being API literate, and aware that they can put these granular level features to work.</p>
<p><a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/push/">Push by Zapier</a> provides another incentive for SaaS providers to have an API. Not all APIs will fuel the development of 3rd party web or mobile apps. Sometimes APIs are just about enabling existing users to better orchestrate, or trigger specific features and events that are important to them--when and where they want. The problem is, what do we call this type of API push service? Push Integration Platform as a Service (piPaaS)? :-) I don't care what its called, I find it easy to get behind anything that enables the average user to put APIs to work.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/04/an-integrations-page-for-your-api-solution/">I wrote about having an integrations page for your API service the other day</a>, and as I'm continuing to study the approach of other providers I find myself stuck on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/product/integrations/">b DataDog's integration page.</a>&nbsp;Datadog provides the monitoring layer across many of the top&nbsp;service providers in the space, making for a pretty stellar list of what solutions are being put to use across the sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Datadog integration page has been open in my browser for the last week, as I make way through each provider. Some of them I'm very familiar with, but others are entirely new to me. Integration pages like this show me what is possible with a service provider like Datadog, but also provides me an opportunity to learn about new services that I can put to use in my own operations, and what the cool kids are using.</p>
<p>When you click on the detail for each of the potential integrations you get more information about what is possible, as well as a configuration file in YAML, and what metrics are made available when monitoring is activated. Datadog even groups their integrations by a tag, something they don't expose via the user interface very well, but is something I'll include in my suggestions for crafting an integration page for any other API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An integration page is definitely a building block I will be suggesting to other API providers, and I am also a big fan of sharing configuration, and other integration details like Datadog does. There are infinite learning opportunities available on this type of API integration pages, for analysts like me, for API providers, as well as service providers who sell to API providers.&nbsp;These are the types of common API building blocks that I feel contribute in a positive way to the tech sector, reflecting&nbsp;what APIs do best--enabling API integration, and API literacy all in the same motion.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-cybersecurity-2.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.splunk.com/2016/10/07/analyzing-the-mirai-botnet-with-splunk/">I was learning from the Splunk's analysis of the Mirai Botnet</a>, which was behind <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/">the massive attack against Krebs on Security</a>, implemented via common Internet of Things devices like security cameras, and printers. I've been reading several of these types of security event analysis, which is something I think is extremely important in helping the industry deal with the increasing number of security events that are occurring across the online landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sharing of log files from compromised systems in this way is super important. We need as many eyes as we can get on these attacks, helping analyze what happened, and maybe possibly who was behind it. Of course, there&nbsp;are some scenarios where you might want to be cautious in opening up this data to the general public, but using common approaches to API <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a> and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">management</a>, this can be managed sensibly--while also adding another logging layer to the conversation, keeping track of who joins participates in the <a href="http://analysis.apievangelist.com/">analysis</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a minimum, the DNS, application, and server logs should be made available via Github, leveraging it's Git core, as well as the Github API as part of the evaluation and analysis of the attack information. Ideally, key aspects of the data, attack vector, and other elements should also be added to some sort of shared API infrastructure for continued community security threat analysis. In addition to the growing number of attacks, and analysis by leading analysts like Splunk, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/topic/cybersecurity-information-sharing">I'm also seeing increased discussion around the sharing of threat data in a standardized way</a>--APIs can act as a distributed engine for this operation.</p>
<p>I learn a lot from the analysis&nbsp;that occurs on security events like this. I know that other security analysts learn from this as well. With digital security being such a critical issue, right along with environmental events like hurricanes, or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/03/making-scientific-research-more-real-time-and-collaborative-using-apis/">health care concerns like the Zika virus</a>, I'm suggesting that APIs be employed in a standardized way. We should have a common checklist for making log files from these security events accessible via APIs to help guide future release. We should also have a common set of API definitions and schema for making it available&nbsp;so that we can begin to standardize the client tooling we use to sense of each event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have a lot of work ahead of us when it comes to putting APIs to work when it comes to online security. It is another area I will continue to evangelize as I see more API and open data patterns emerge. I am looking to help stimulate 3rd party analysis of <a href="http://cybersecurity.apievangelist.com">cybersecurity</a>, and <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">security</a> events. In my opinion, it is the only way we are going to make sense of such a massively complex problem.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-embeddable.png" alt="" width="25%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am seeing some renewed interest and discussion around <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">API driven embeddable(s)</a>--an area of my API research that has been going on for years, focusing on buttons, badges, and widgets, but is something that I'm seeing continued investment in from API providers lately. To help fuel the innovation that is already occurring, I figured I'd contribute with my API thoughts extracted from across the bot and voice API landscape.</p>
<p>As I monitor the bot community growing out of the Slack platform, the voice API integration emerging from the Alexa development community, and read news about Google's latest push into the space, I'm thinking about how APIs are being used to define the intents, skills, and actions that are&nbsp;driving these bot and voice implementations. I am also processing this intersection with the latest release of Push by Zapier. All of this about delivering the meaningful API responses, to where the end users desire--in their browser, their chat, or voice enablement in the business and home.</p>
<p>While processing the wisdom shared by Yelp about their deployment of embeddable reviews, I'm thinking about how these embeddable JavaScript widgets can be used to further allow users to quantify the intent, discover the skills, and achieve the action they are looking for. How can API providers, and the savvy API developers make valuable API resources accessible to users on their terms, and in the client they desire. For example, I might need to know my availability next Thursday while talking to my Amazon Echo, engaging in a Slack conversation, or possibly filling out a form on my corporate network--in all these scenarios I will need API access to the calendar(s) that I depend on, in the way that is required in each unique situation.</p>
<p>I am not always the biggest fan of voice and bot enabled scenarios, but I do think they provide us with some interesting constraints&nbsp;on API design. I'm hoping that some of these constraints can further be applied to legacy approaches of API deployment. Voice and bots are nothing new, but the current wave of evolution, in this time of abundant API-driven data, content, and algorithms, hold a lot of potential. This is why I spend so much time looking at so many different areas, is that the cross-pollination opportunities are sometimes the most interesting ones, and are often the ones that folks can't always see from&nbsp;the individual verticals where they are putting APIs to work.</p>

<p>I am watching the world of Internet of Things (IoT) unfold, not because I'm a big fan of it, but more because I'm concerned that it is happening, and often worried that much of it is happening without any focus on security, and privacy. As I look at this week's stories in my API IoT bucket I can't help but think that IoT is a live demonstration of how the regulatory beasts, that we love to hate on in America, are created.</p>
<p>It starts with a bunch of fast moving, greedy, corner cutting capitalists who are innovating and all that shit. These are not always the first wave of movers in a space, but usually the second and third waves of opportunists with one thing in mind--making some money. These are the companies that are so focused on revenue and profits they ignore things like security, and they see the data generated being key to their success, and concepts around privacy often do not even exist--it's the new oil motha fuckkers!</p>
<p>As the number of security and privacy events increase, things like <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/">the unprecedented attack on Krebs on Security</a>, the calls for a fix will only&nbsp;grow. Eventually, these calls for help are heard by the government, if they are negatively impacting enough well to do white folk, and the government steps up to figure out what to do. Often times, these investigative forces aren't fully up to speed on the area they are investigating, but with the resources they have, they'll usually inflict some regulatory and legal response. If there are any existing companies with a strong lobbying presence, the immediate response will be significantly watered down, making it more of a nuisance than anything else.</p>
<p>This is when the market voice begins its complaining about the government overstepping its responsibilities, and stepping in to throw a wet blanket on business. The government is bad. Regulation is bad. Then we repeat, rinse, and go about our days. This is how regulatory beasts are born, nurtured, and fed on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The Internet of Things is the modern poster child for this process. &nbsp;In a couple years, after more of this bad behavior continues, we will see an increasing amount of government legislation and regulatory intervention into the world of IoT. Then we will hear more squealing from the startups and enterprises who could have just behaved sensibly in the beginning, as they turn up the volume about how the government is so bad, and so anti-business and anti-innovation.</p>

<p>There is a lot of data coming out of the automobile industry. I was just reading about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/05/udacity-open-sources-an-additional-183gb-of-driving-data/">Udacity open sources an additional 183GB of driving </a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/05/udacity-open-sources-an-additional-183gb-of-driving-data/">data</a> and <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2016/10/05/this-global-public-registry-of-electric-vehicle-charging-locations-has-42k-listings/">the global public registry of electric vehicle charging locations with 42K+ listings</a>, providing us with two examples from the wild. I'm seeing an increasing number of these stories about institutions, government agencies, and the private sector making automobile related data available in this way--pointing to a pretty big opportunity when it comes to aggregating this valuable "data exhaust" (pun intended) in a coherent&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>Whether its self-driving, electric, car share, rental or otherwise, the modern automobile is generating a lot of data. There are some significant ways in which the automobile industry is being expanded upon, and the need to understand, and become more aware using data are immense. Making API access for this public, and private data will be increasingly important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a number of different interests producing this data, and they aren't always immediately thinking about sharing, and reuse of the data, let alone making sure there is standardized APIs and data schema at play. Opening up a pretty big opportunity for someone to focus on aggregating all these emerging automobile datasets, make available via a unified API, and helping define a common set of API definitions and schema for accessing this valuable data exhaust from the industry.</p>
<p>I do not think automobile industry data aggregation is the next VC fundable idea, but I to think that with some hard work, and the slow build of some expertise in this fast moving area, an individual, or small group of folks could do very well. I know from dabbling in this area that the auto industry, the department of transportation, and the aftermarket product and service providers don't always see eye to eye, and a neutral, 3rd party aggregator&nbsp;and evangelist has the potential to make a significant impact.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/google_improve_your_api_experience.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>We all like it when the API providers we depend on make using their APIs easier to put to work. I also like it when API providers also share the story behind how they are making their APIs easier to use because it gives me material for a story, but more importantly it provides examples that other API providers can consider as part of their own operations.</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2016/10/key-improvements-for-your-api-experience.html">Google recently shared some of the improvements they have made to help make our API experience better</a>--here are some of the key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faster, more flexible key generation </strong>- Making this step simpler, by reducing the old multi-step process with a single click.</li>
<li><strong>Streamlined getting started flow -</strong>&nbsp;Introduced an in-flow credential set up procedure directly embedded within the developer documentation.</li>
<li><strong>An API Dashboard -</strong> To easily view usage and quotas, so you can view all the APIs you&rsquo;re using along with usage, error and latency data.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you spend any time-consuming APIs you know that these areas represent the common friction many of us API developers experience regularly. It is nice to see Google addressing these areas of friction, as well as sharing their story with the rest of us, providing us all a reminder of how we can cut off these sharp corners in our own operations.</p>
<p>These areas represent what I'd say are the two biggest pain points with getting up and going using an API, and the API dashboard represents the biggest pain point we face once we are up and running--where do we stand with our API consumption, within the rate limits provided by the platform. If you use a modern API management platform you probably have a dashboard solution in place, but for API providers who have hand-rolled their own solution, this continues to be a big problem area.</p>
<p>While some of the historical Google API experiences have left us API consumers desiring more (Google Translate, Google+, Web Search), they have over 100 public APIs, and their approach to standardizing their approach is full of best practices and positive examples we can follow. As they continue to step up their game, I'll keep tuning in to see what else I can share.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-danger-shaky.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am regularly reminded in my world as the API Evangelist that things are rarely ever what they seem on the surface. Meaning that what a company actually does, and what a company says it does are rarely in sync. This is one of the reasons I like APIs, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/03/apis-can-give-an-honest-view-of-what-a-company-does/">is they often give a more honest look at what a company does (or does not do)</a>, potentially cutting through the bullshit of marketing.</p>
<p>It would be nice if companies were straight up about their intentions, and relied upon building better products, offering more valuable services, but many companies prefer being aggressive, misleading their customers, and in some cases an entire industry. I'm reminded of this fact once again while reading a post on <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1136184/Software-backward-compatibility-undocumented-APIs">software backward compatibility, undocumented APIs and importance of history</a>, which provided a stark example of it in action from the past:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span>&ldquo;</span><strong>Embrace, extend, and extinguish</strong><span>&ldquo;,</span><sup id="cite_ref-DeadlyEmbrace_1-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish#cite_note-DeadlyEmbrace-1">[1]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;also known as &ldquo;</span><strong>Embrace, extend, and exterminate</strong><span>&ldquo;,</span><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;is a phrase that the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice">U.S. Department of Justice</a><span>&nbsp;found</span><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;that was used internally by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;to describe its strategy for entering product categories involving widely used standards, extending those standards with&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">proprietary</a><span>&nbsp;capabilities, and then using those differences to disadvantage its competitors.</span></p>
<p><span>This behavior is one of the contributing factors to why the most recent generation(s) of developers are so adverse to standards&nbsp;and is behavior that exists within current open API and open source efforts. From experience, I would emphasize that the more a company feels the need to say they are open source, or open API, the more likely they are indulging in this type of behavior. It is like,&nbsp;some sort of subconscious response, like the dishonest person needing to state that they are being honest, or that you need to believe them--we are open, trust us.</span></p>
<p>I am not writing this post as some attempt to remind us that Microsoft is bad--this isn't at all about Microsoft. It is simply to remind us that this behavior has existed in the past, and it exists right now. Not all companies involved in helping define the API space are not interested in things being open, and that there are common specifications in place for us all to use. Some companies are more interested in slowing what happens within the community, and ensuring that when possible, all roads lead to their proprietary solution. This is just my regular reminder to always be aware.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Oct 2016</span>
        <p>I have been&nbsp;spending time thinking about how we can build in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/08/when-working-with-our-api-make-sure-you-build-faultresistance-into-your-code/">fault tolerance</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/28/thinking-about-how-i-can-build-change-resilience-into-my-api-integrations/">change resiliency</a> into our API SDKs, and client code. I want to better understand what is necessary to develop the best possible integrations as possible. While doing my regular monitoring this week I came across a <a href="https://twitter.com/Runscope/status/783020481276317696/">Tweet from @Runscope</a>, with a pretty interesting image on this subject <a href="https://twitter.com/realm">crafted by @realm</a>, a mobile platform for sync.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/ct3y_zqviaaggk5.jpg" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>There is a wealth of building blocks here to apply at the client and SDK level, helping us achieve more fault tolerance, and make our applications, systems, and device integrations more change resilient. I wanted to break them out, providing a bulleted list I could include in my research:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-broken-link.png" alt="" width="15%" align="right" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Is the API Online?</li>
<li>Did the server receive the request?</li>
<li>Was URL request successful?</li>
<li>Did the request timeout?</li>
<li>Was there a server error?</li>
<li>Was JSON receive successfully?</li>
<li>Was JSON malformed?</li>
<li>Was there an unexpected response?</li>
<li>Were we&nbsp;able to map to JSON successfully?</li>
<li>Is the JSON valid?</li>
<li>Does local model match server model?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some valuable nuggets present in this diagram. It should be crafted into some sort of algorithmic template that developers can apply when developing their API integrations, as well as for API providers when developing the SDK and client solutions they make available to their API communities. I'm taking note so that next time I spend some cycles on my <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">API SDK research</a> I can help solidify my own definition.</p>
<p>This is a very micro look at fault-tolerance when it comes to API integration, and I'm continuing to look for other examples of change resiliency at this layer. Meaning, is there a plan B for the API call? Is there revenue ceiling considerations? Or other more non-technical, business and political considerations that should be baked into the code as well. Helping us all think more deeply around how we encourage change resiliency across&nbsp;the API community.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/06/adding-behaviordriven-development-assertions-to-my-api-research/">As I was learning about behavior driven development (BDD) and test driven development (TDD) this week</a>, I quickly found myself applying this way of thought to my <a href="http://regulation.apievangelist.com">existing API regulation</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/04/pushing-for-more-algorithmic-transparency-using-apis/">algorithmic transparency</a> research. BDD and TDD are both used by API developers to ensure APIs are doing what they are supposed to, in development, QA, and production environments. There is no reason that this line of thought can't be elevated beyond just development groups to other business units, up to a wider industry level, or possibly employed by regulators to validate data or algorithmic solutions.</p>
<p>I am not a huge fan of government regulation, but I am a fan of algorithms doing what is being promised, and APIs plus BDD and TDD testing is one way that we can accomplish this. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/14/the-future-of-public-private-sector-partnerships-being-negotiated-at-the-api-oauth-scope-level/">Similar to how the federal government is working together to define OAuth scopes which help&nbsp;sets the bar for how a user&nbsp;data is accessed</a>, BDD assertion templates can be defined, shared, and validated within regulated industries.</p>
<p>Right now we are just focused at the very local level when it comes to API assertions. With time I'm hoping an API assertion template format will emerge (maybe already something out there), and I'm hoping that we evolve ways for allowing the average business user to be part of defining and validating API assertions. I know my friends over at <a href="https://restlet.com/products/dhc/">Restlet are working towards this with their DHC client solution</a>, which provides testing solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BDD, TDD, and API assertions still very much exist in the technical environments where APIs are born&nbsp;and managed. I'm hoping to help define the space, identify opportunities for establishing common patterns&nbsp;while encouraging more reuse of leading patterns. Like other layers of the API economy, I am hoping that API assertions will expand beyond just the technical, and enjoy use amongst business groups, including industry leaders, and government regulators when it applies.</p>

<p>Sharing of <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> is critical to any industry or public sector where APIs are being put to work. If the API sector is going to scale effectively, it needs to be reusing common patterns, something that many API and open data providers have not been that great at historically. While this is critical in any business sector, there is no single area where this needs to happen more urgently than within the public sector.</p>
<p>I have spent years trying wade through the volumes of open data that comes out of government, and even spent a period of time doing this in DC for the White House. The lack of open API definition formats like <a href="https://openapis.org/specification">OpenAPISpec</a>, <a href="http://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a>, <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and <a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a> across government is a passion of mine, so I'm very pleased to the&nbsp;new <a href="http://federation.data.gov/">US Data Federation</a> project coming out of the General Services Administration (GSA).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The U.S. Data Federation supports data interoperability and harmonization across Federal, state, and local government agencies by highlighting common data formats, API specifications, and metadata vocabularies."</p>
<p>The&nbsp;U.S. Data Federation has focused in on some of the existing patterns that exist in service of the public sector, including seven existing initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building &amp; Land Development Specification</li>
<li>National Information Exchange Model</li>
<li>Open Referral</li>
<li>Open311</li>
<li>Project Open Data</li>
<li>Schema.org</li>
<li>The Voting Information Project</li>
</ul>
<p>I am a big supporter of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">Open Referral,</a> <a href="http://open311.org">Open311</a>, Project Open data, and <a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/">Schema.org</a>. I will step up and get more familiar&nbsp;with the building &amp; land development specification, national information exchange model, and the voting information projects. The US Data Federal project echoes the work I've been doing with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/07/25/taking-a-look-at-whats-next-for-the-environmental-protection-agency-epa-envirofacts-data-service-api/">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Envirofacts Data Service API</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/26/taking-another-look-at-the-department-of-labor-api-efforts/">Department of Labor APIs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ed-data/fafsa-api">FAFSA API</a>, and my general <a href="http://adopta.agency">Adopta.Agency</a> efforts.</p>
<p>Defining the current inventory of government APIs and open data using OpenAPI Spec, and indexing the with APIs.json&nbsp;is how we do the hard work of identifying the common patterns that are already in place&nbsp;and being used by agencies on the ground. Once this is mapped out, we can begin the long road towards defining the common patterns that could be proposed as future initiatives for the US Data Federation. I think the project highlights this well <a href="http://federation.data.gov/about/">on their about page</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;"These examples will highlight emerging data standards and API initiatives across all levels of government, convey the level of maturity for each effort, and facilitate greater participation by government agencies."</p>
<p>The world of API definitions is a messy one. It may seem straightforward if you are a standards&nbsp;oriented person. It may also seem straightforward if you are a scrappy startup person. In reality, the current landscape is a tug of war&nbsp;between these two words. There are a wealth of existing web API concepts, specifications, and data standards available to us, but there are also a lot of leading definitions being defined by tech giants like Amazon, Google, Twitter, and others. With the tone set by VC investment, and distorted views on what intellectual property is, the sharing of open API definitions and schemas has been deficient across many sectors, for many years.</p>
<p>What the GSA is doing with the&nbsp;<a href="http://federation.data.gov/">US Data Federation</a>&nbsp;project is important. They are mapping out the common patterns that already exist, and providing a forum for helping identify others, as well as to help evolve the less mature, or disparate API and schema patterns out in the wild. A positive sign that they are heading in the right direction is also that <a href="https://github.com/GSA/us-data-federation">the&nbsp;US Data Federation&nbsp;project is operating on Github</a>. It is important that these common patterns exist on the social coding platform, as it's increasingly being used as an engine for the API economy--touch all stops along the API life cycle.</p>
<p>I will carve out the time to go through some of my existing government open data work, which includes rebooting <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">my Open Referral leadership role</a>. I'm finding that just doing the hard work crafting OpenAPI Specs for government APIs is a very important piece of the puzzle. We need a machine-readable map of what already exists, otherwise, it is very difficult to find a way forward in the massive amounts of government open data available to us. However, I believe that when you take these machine readable API definitions and put them on Github, it becomes much easier to find the common patterns that the GSA is looking to define with&nbsp;<a href="http://federation.data.gov/">US Data Federation</a>.</p>

<p>I'm neck deep in studying how Amazon is operating their Alexa platform, so I'm pretty excited about <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/schedule/">the chance to listen&nbsp;and learn from the Alexa team at APIStrat in Boston</a>. Even if you aren't building voice-enabled applications, the approach to developing, managing, and evangelizing the Alexa platform provides a wealth of best practices that we should all strive to emulate in our own operations.</p>
<p>Rob McCauley (<a href="https://twitter.com/RobMcCauley">@RobMcCauley</a>) from the Amazon Alexa team is doing a workshop, as well as a keynote at @APIStrat in Boston next month. This is relevant to what is going on in the wider space because voice-enablement is a fast-moving layer when it comes to delivering API resources, helping define what is being dubbed as the conversational interface movement, while also providing the best practices for a modern API strategy that I mentioned above.</p>
<p>There are a number of things that the Alexa team does which have captured my attention, including their approach to developing skills, their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/10/investing-in-your-api-community-like-amazon-and-slack/">investment ($$) into their developers</a>, and their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/04/amazon-alexa-as-an-example-when-it-comes-to-api-communications/">overall communication strategy</a>. I'm working on profiling all of this as part of what I call a blueprint reports, where I map out the approach of the Alexa team in a way that other API providers can put to work in their own operations.</p>
<p>I'm thinking I will have to wait until after @APIStrat to finish my blueprint report, as I'd like to attend the Alexa workshop, hear his keynote, and possibly even talk to him personally about their approach, in the hallway. I hope to see you there, and hear you share your story, even if you aren't on the stage at APIStrat, the hallways tend to be a great place to listen to the story of leaders from across the space,&nbsp;as well as share your own--no matter how big or small you might be.</p>
<p>Make sure <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/registration/">you get registered for APIStrat</a> before it is sold out, and I'll see you there!</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-answers-architect-more-confidently-effectively-on-aws/">Amazon launched their own questions and answers site called simply called AWS Answers</a>. Amazon is definitely in a class of their own, but I thought the move reflects illnesses in the wider QA space&nbsp;and an approach that smaller API providers might want to consider for their operations.</p>
<p>Quora doesn't have an API, so why would we use as a QA solution for the API space? I don't care how much network they have. While Stack Overflow is a wealth of API related questions and answers, the environment has been found to be pretty toxic for some API providers. Making hand rolling your own QA site a more interesting option.</p>
<p>AWS answers is&nbsp;a pretty basic implementation&nbsp;but also has a wealth of valuable content. it wouldn't take much to handroll your own FAQ or wider answers solution&nbsp;within your <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">API developer portal</a>. I can understand why AWS would do their own, to help ensure their users are able to find the answers they need, without leaving the AWS platform. It depends on the type of platform you are operating, but keeping QA local might make more sense than using 3rd party solutions--allowing for more precise control over the answers your customers receive.</p>
<p>As I work to expand my <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">API portal definition beyond just the minimum version</a>, I'm adding a FAQ solution to the stack, and now I'm going to consider adding a separate answers solution modeled after <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/">AWS Answers</a>. While I think platforms like Stack Overflow and Quora will continue to do well, I'm more interested in supporting API providers to roll their own solution, maybe even provide an API, and allow for more interoperability, and control over their own resources.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/14500451_10157473672265368_6769931295752399398_o.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" />A friend of mine messaged me this photo of the Southwest Airlines flight API on Facebook the other day. After doing a little homework I found that every flight has this available on the planes local network. There is a pretty interesting <a href="http://rogerparks.com/projects/southwest-flight-logging/">write up on it from Roger Parks</a>&nbsp;if you care to learn more.</p>
<p>Looking through the response it has all the information you need for your flight update screen. It might seem scary for folks like us poking around the network on airplanes looking for things like this, but this is just the nature of the Internet and something any network operator should consider as normal.</p>
<p>The API is available at&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">getconnected.southwestwifi.com/current.json</span> when you are on the planes local network, and I'd consult Roger's post if you want more details about how to sniff it out using your browser. Anytime I am on a guest network on a plane or in a hotel, I enjoy turning on my <a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles Proxy</a> to log a list of all the domains and IP address in use.</p>
<p>This is a good way to learn about how people are architecting their networks, and delivering their resources to web, mobile, and device users. The problem with this activity is that sometimes you can discover things that you shouldn't. A line that I worry about a lot. I feel pretty strongly that if companies are using public DNS, or opening up their private network to the public, they should be aware that this is going to happen.</p>
<p>I hope that someday this type of behavior is embraced by companies, institutions, and government agencies. Not everyone will have good intentions like I do, but network operators should know this will happen, and make the those of us where white hats welcome, so that we will report insecure infrstructure,&nbsp;and help&nbsp;keep things locked down--before the bad guys get in.</p>
<p>Thanks to my friend Jason for pinging me with this. From reading up on it, it is nothing new, but still worthy of noting, and talking about. I love learning about all the APIs that exist in the cracks.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2016</span>
        <p>The common approach to discovering that a SaaS provider has an API is through a single, external link in the footer of a website, simply labeled API or developers. Whenever I can I'm on the lookout for evolutionary approaches to making users aware of an API, and I just found a good one over at CloudFlare.</p>
<p>When you are logged into CloudFlare managing your DNS, right below the area for adding, editing, and deleting DNS records you are given some extra options, including expandable access to your API--down in the right-hand corner, between Advanced and Help.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/cloudflare_dns_api_inline_1.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Once you click on the API option, you are given a listing of DNS record related API endpoints, allowing me to bake the same functionality available to me in the CloudFlare UI, into my own systems and application. A summary, path, and verb is provided for each relevant API, with a link to the full API documentation.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist-site/blog/cloudflare-dns-api-inline-2.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>I really like this approach. It is a great way to make APIs more accessible to the muggles (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseySoftware">@CaseySoftware</a>). It is also a great way to think about connecting UI functionality to the (hopefully) API behind. Imagine if every UI element had an API link in the corner to see the API behind, and a link to its documentation . You could even display the request and response bodies for the API call made by the UI, allowing people to easily reverse engineer what an API does.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have suggested this approach at several events, and to other API technologists who felt it was a bad idea, as the user doesn't want to be bothered by the details of why something does what it does, they just want it to be done. I disagree. I strongly believe that this is an extension of old school beliefs by the IT wizards, that the muggles aren't smart enough, and IT should have all the power (one ring and all that).</p>
<p>Seriously, though. There is no reason that everyone shouldn't be exposed to the API behind, and if they want to learn more they can. If they do not want to learn more, they do not have to. I'm going to be evangelizing for more links to the API developer portal, API documentation, and other resources from within the UI of the SaaS solutions we use. This will help make sure that all users are aware of the API behind, and the opportunities for putting it to use in external applications, tooling, and services.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/google_auditing.gif" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/2016/05/google-mobile-management-introducing.html">Google just released a mobile audit solution for their Google Apps Unlimited users</a>&nbsp;looking to monitor activity across iOS and Android devices. At first look, the concept didn't strike me as anything I should write about, but once I got to thinking about how the concept applies beyond mobile to IoT, and the potentially for external 3rd party auditing of API and endpoint consumption--it stood out as a pattern I'd like to have in the filing cabinet for future reference.</p>
<p>Using the Google Admin SDK Reports&nbsp;API you can access mobile audit information by users, device, or by auditing&nbsp;event. API responses include details about the device including model, serial numbers, user emails, and any other element that included as part of device inventory. This model seems like it could easily be adapted to IoT devices, bot and voice clients.</p>
<p>One aspect that stood out for me as a pattern I'd like to see emulated elsewhere, is the ability to verify that all of your deployed devices are running the latest security updates. After <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/">the recent IoT launched DDOS attack on Krebs on Security</a>, I would suggest that the security camera industry needs to consider implementing an audit API, with the ability to check for camera device security updates.</p>
<p>Another area that caught my attention was their mention that <em>"mobile administrators have been asking for is a way to take proactive actions on devices without requiring manual intervention."</em> Meaning you could automate certain events, turning off, or limiting access to specific API resources. When you open this up to IoT devices, I can envision many benefits depending on the type of device in play.</p>
<p>There are two dimensions of this story for me. That you can have these audit events apply to potentially any client that is consuming API resources, as well as the fact that you can access this data in real time, or on a scheduled basis via an API. With a little webhook action involved, I could really envision&nbsp;some interesting auditing scenarios that are internally executed, as well as an increasing number of them being executed by external 3rd party auditors making sure mobile, devices, and other API-driven&nbsp;clients are operating as intended.</p>

<p>I was <a href="http://chaijs.com/api/assert/">going through Chai, a behavior, and test driven assertion library</a>, and spending some time learning about behavior driven development, or BDD, as it applies to APIs today. This is one of the topics I've read about and <a href="http://www.pragmaticapi.com/blog/2013/11/10/bdd-for-apis-talk-at-apistrat-sf-2013">listened to talks from people I look up to</a>, but just haven't had the time to invest too many cycles in learning more. As I do with other interesting, and applicable areas, I'm going to add as a research area, which will force me to bump it up in priority.</p>
<p>In short, BDD is how you test to make sure an API is doing what is expected of it. It is how the smart API providers are testing their APIs, during development, and production to make sure they are delivering on their contract. Doing what I do, I started going through the leading approaches to BDD with APIs, and came up with these solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://chaijs.com">Chai</a> -&nbsp;A BDD / TDD assertion library for&nbsp;node&nbsp;and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.</li>
<li><a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> - <span style="background-color: rgba(243, 168, 163, 0.952941);">A</span><span>&nbsp;behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> -&nbsp;<span>Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on&nbsp;</span><a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a><span>&nbsp;and in the browser, making asynchronous testing&nbsp;</span><em>simple</em><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><em>fun</em><span>.</span></li>
<li><a href="http://nightwatchjs.org/">Nightwatch.js</a> -&nbsp;Nightwatch.js is an easy to use Node.js based End-to-End (E2E) testing solution for browser based apps and websites.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fluentassertions.com/">Fluent Assertions</a> -&nbsp;<span>Fluent Assertions is a set of .NET extension methods that allow you to more naturally specify the expected outcome of a TDD or BDD-style test.</span></li>
<li><a href="http://vowsjs.org/">Vows</a> -&nbsp;Asynchronous behaviour driven development for Node.</li>
<li><a href="http://unexpected.js.org/">Unexpectd</a> -&nbsp;The extensible BDD assertion toolkit</li>
</ul>
<p>If you know of any that I'm missing, please let me know. I will establish a research project, add them to it, and get to work monitoring what they are up to, and better track on the finer aspects of BDD. As I was searching on the topic I also came across these references that I think are worth noting, because they are from existing providers I'm already tracking on.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.runscope.com/docs/api-testing/assertions">Runscope</a> - Discussing BDD using Runscope API monitoring.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.getpostman.com/2015/09/29/writing-a-behaviour-driven-api-testing-environment-within-postman/">Postman</a> - Discussing BDD using Postman API client.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am just getting going with this area, but it is something I'm feeling goes well beyond just testing&nbsp;and touches on many of the business and political aspects of API operations I am most concerned with. I'm looking to provide ways to verify an API does what it is supposed to, as well as making sure an API sizes up to claims made by developers or the provider. I'm also on the hunt for any sort of definition format that can be applied across many different providers--something I could include as part of APIs.json indexes&nbsp;and OpenAPI Specs.</p>
<p>Earlier I had written on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/08/the-api-assertions-we-make-believe-in-and-require-for-our-business-contracts/">the API assertions we make, believe in, and require for our business&nbsp;contracts</a>. This is an area I'm looking&nbsp;to expand on with this API assertion research. I am also looking to include BDD as part of&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/04/pushing-for-more-algorithmic-transparency-using-apis/">my thoughts on algorithmic transparency</a>, exploring how BDD assertions can be used to validate the algorithms that are guiding more of our personal and business worlds. It's an interesting area that I know many of my friends have been talking about for a while&nbsp;but is now something I want to work to help normalize for the rest of us who might not be immersed in the world of API testing.</p>

<p style="white-space: normal;"><a href="http://apievangelist.com">I have over 70 areas of research occurring right now as part of my API lifecycle work</a>--these are areas that I feel directly impact how APIs are provided and consumed today. <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist">Each of these areas lives as a Github repository</a>, using Github Pages as the front-end of the research.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;">I use Github for managing my research because of its capabilities for managing not just code, but also machine readable data formats like JSON, CSV, and YAML. I'm not just trying to understand each area of the API lifecycle, I am working to actually map it out in a machine readable way.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;">This process takes a lot of effort, and is always work in progress. To help me manage the workload I rely on Github, the Github API, and Github Pages. On top of this&nbsp;Github base, I leverage the data and content capabilities of Jekyll when you run it on Github Pages (or any other Jekyll enabled server or cloud service).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;">Each of my research areas begins with me curating news from across space, then I profile companies and individuals who are doing interesting things with APIs, and the services, tooling, and APIs they are developing. I process all of this information on a weekly basis and publish to each of my research projects as its YAML core.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;">An example of this can be seen with <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">my API monitoring research</a> (the most up to date) with the following machine-readable&nbsp;components:</p>
<ul style="white-space: normal;">
<li><strong>Master APIs.json</strong>&nbsp; - Each project has a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-evangelist/monitoring/gh-pages/_data/apis.yaml">YAML APIs.json</a>&nbsp;(I know, I know) core, with a <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/apis.json">dynamically generated JSON version in the root of site</a>, providing an index of all the companies and APIs included in this research.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Individual APIs.json</strong> - In addition to the central project APIs.JSON file, there are individual APIs.JSON files for each company included in my research, which includes OpenAPI Specs for all APIs I have indexed.</li>
<li><strong>Blog Atom </strong>- There is <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/data/blog-atom.xml">an atom feed for the blog</a>, showing any posts I write on API monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>News Atom&nbsp;</strong>- There is&nbsp;<a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/data/news-atom.xml">an atom feed for the news</a>, showing any items I have curated as part of my API monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Blog OPML </strong>- I include an <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/data/blog-opml.xml">OPML file of all the companies</a> who have blogs and feeds available.</li>
<li><strong>Github OPML -</strong> I also started including <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/data/github-opml.xml">an OPML file of all the companies who have a Github profile,</a> providing a list of feeds for their accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p style="white-space: normal;">I also have several machine readable elements available which use&nbsp;<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to drive the content for each research project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building Blocks -</strong> There is a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-evangelist/monitoring/gh-pages/_data/buildingblocks.yaml">YAML core listing of the building blocks</a> I aggregate across my API research, as well as a <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/data/buildingblocks.json">dynamic JSON one</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Curated</strong>&nbsp;- There is a&nbsp;<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-evangelist/monitoring/gh-pages/_data/curated.yaml">YAML core listing of the news, stories, and other content I aggregate</a> across my API research, as well as a&nbsp;<a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/data/curated.json">dynamic JSON one</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Organizations</strong>&nbsp;- There is a&nbsp;<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-evangelist/monitoring/gh-pages/_data/organizations.yaml">YAML core listing of just the organizations I aggregate</a> across my API research, as well as a&nbsp;<a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/data/organizations.json">dynamic JSON one</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>&nbsp;- There is a&nbsp;<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-evangelist/monitoring/gh-pages/_data/tools.yaml">YAML core listing the building blocks</a>&nbsp;I aggregate across my API research, as well as a&nbsp;<a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/data/tools.json">dynamic JSON one</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I update any of my research areas I just publish the YAML to each of my research project "jigs", and everything is updated. The content is dynamically driven using Liquid, which leverages a YAML-driven core. This allows me to manage 70+ research projects as a one-person operation. The news and analysis is published automatically each day as I do my monitoring, but the organizations, APIs, and tooling is manually triggered as I get the time to dive into each area.</p>
<p>I am writing about this because I just locked down this machine readable core for my <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">API monitoring research</a>, which will set the bar for the rest of my research occurring over the next year. I will replicate the latest definition across all 70+ areas over the next couple of weeks as I get the bandwidth to spend within in each area. I couldn't do what I do without Github, its API, Github Pages, and Jekyll--they make my world go round.</p>

<p>I feel like I have said this before, but probably is something that is worth refreshing--where is the WordPress for APIs? First, I know WordPress has an API, that isn't what I'm talking about. Second, I know WordPress is not our best foot forward when it comes to the web. What I am talking about is a ready to go API deployment solutions in a variety of areas, that are as easy to deploy and manage as WordPress.</p>
<p>There is a reason WordPress is as popular as it is. I do not run WordPress for any of my infrastructure, but I do help others setup&nbsp;and operate their own WordPress installs from time to time. I get why people like it. I personally think its a nightmare in there, when you start having to make it do things as a programmer, but I fully grasp why others dig it, and willing to support that whenever I can.</p>
<p>I want the same type of enabling solution for APIs. If you want a link API -- here you go. If you want a product API -- download over here. There should be a wealth of open source solutions that you can just download, unzip, upload, and go through the wizard. You get the API&nbsp;and a simple management interface. I would get to work building one in PHP / MySQL just to piss all the real programmers off, but I have too many projects on my plate already.</p>

<p>I get the argument from hypermedia and linked data practitioners that we need to model our web API behavior on the web. It makes sense, and I agree that we need to be baking hypermedia into our API design practices. What I have trouble with is the fact that the web is a cornerstone that we should be modeling&nbsp;it after. I do not know what web y'all use every day, but the one I use, and harvest regularly is quite often is a pretty broken thing.</p>
<p>It just feels like we overlooking so much to support this one story. I'm not saying that hypermedia principles don't apply because the web is shit, I'm just saying maybe it isn't as convincing of an anchor to build a story that currently web APIs are shit. I understand that you want to sell your case, and trust me...I want you to sell your case, but using this argument just does not pencil out for me.</p>
<p>There is another aspect of this that I find difficult. That the web was developed and took root in a very different environment than web APIs are. We had more time and space to be more thoughtful about the web, and I do not think we have that luxury with web APIs. The stakes are higher, the competition is greater, and the incentives for doing it thoughtfully really do not exist in the startup environment that has taken hold. We can't be condemning API designers and architects for serving their current master (or can we?).&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I will keep using <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">core web concepts and specs</a> to help guide my views on designing, defining, and deploying my web APIs, I'm going to explore other ways to articulate why we should be putting them to use. I'm going to also be considering the success or failure of these elements based on the shortcomings of the web, and web APIs,&nbsp;while I work to better polish the existing stories we tell, as well as hopefully evolve new ones that help folks understand what the best practices for web APIs are.</p>

<p>I am playing around with some new features <a href="http://apimatic.io">from the SDK generation as a service provider APIMATIC</a>, including the ability to deploy my SDKs to Github. This is just many of the ways Github, and more importantly Git is being used as what I'd consider as an engine in the API economy. Deploying your SDKs is nothing new, but when your autogenerating SDKs from API definitions, deploying to Github and then using that to drive deployment, virtualization, containers, serverless, documentation, testing, and other stops along the API life cycle--it is pretty significant.</p>
<p>Increasingly we are publishing API definitions to Github, the server side code that serves up an API, the Docker image for deploying and scaling our APIs, the documentation that tell us what an API does, the tests that validate our continuous integration, as well as the clients and SDKs. I've been long advocating for use of Github as part of API operations, but with the growth in the number of APIs we are designing, deploying, and managing--Github definitely seems like the progressive way forward for API operations.</p>
<p>I will keep tracking on which service providers allow for importing from Github, as well as publishing to Github--whether its definitions, server images, configuration, or code. As these features continue to become available in these companies APIs I predict we will see the pace of continuous integration and API orchestration dramatically pick up. As we are more easily able to automate the importing and exporting of essential definitions, configurations, and the code that makes our businesses and organizations function.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://apimatic.io"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/apimatic-logo.png" alt="" width="20%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I've been a big supporter of <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> since they started, so I'm happy to see them continuing to evolve their approach to delivering SDKs&nbsp;using machine readable API definitions. I got a walkthrough of their new DX Kits the other day, something that feels like an evolutionary step for SDKs, and contributing to API providers making onboarding and integration as frictionless as possible for developers.</p>
<p>Let's walk through what APIMATIC already does, then I'll talk more about some of the evolutionary steps they are taking when auto-generating SDKs. It helps to see the big picture of where APIMATIC fits into the larger API lifecycle to assist you in getting beyond any notion of them simply being just an SDK generation service.</p>
<p><strong>API Definitions</strong><br />What makes APIMATIC such an important service, in my opinion, is that they just don't speak using modern API definition formats, they speak in all of the API definition formats, allowing anyone to generate SDKs from the specification of your choice:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apimatic.io"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_transformer.png" alt="" width="22%" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>API Blueprint</li>
<li>Swagger 1.0 - 1.2</li>
<li>Swagger 2.0 JSON</li>
<li>Swagger 2.0 YAML</li>
<li>WADL - W3C 2009</li>
<li>Google Discovery</li>
<li>RAML 0.8</li>
<li>I/O Docs - Mashery</li>
<li>HAR 1.2</li>
<li>Postman Collection</li>
<li>APIMATIC Format</li>
</ul>
<p>As any serious API service provider should do be doing, <a href="https://apitransformer.com/">APIMATIC then opened up their API definition transformation solution as a standalone service and API</a>. This allows this type ofAPI &nbsp;transformations to occur&nbsp;and be baked in, at every stop along a modern API lifecycle,&nbsp;by anyone.</p>
<p><strong>API Design</strong><br />Being so API definition driven focused, APIMATIC needed a practical way to manage API definitions, and allow their customers to add, edit, delete, and manipulate the definitions that would be driving the SDK auto generation process. APIMATIC provides one of the best API design interfaces I've found across the API service providers that I monitor, allowing customers to manage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Endpoints</li>
<li>Models</li>
<li>Test Cases</li>
<li>Errors</li>
</ul>
<p>Because APIMATIC is so heavily invested in having a complete API definition, one that it will result in a successful SDK, they've had to bake healthy API design practices into their API design interface--helping developers craft the best API possible. #Winning</p>
<p><strong>SDK Auto Generation</strong><br />Now we get to the valuable, and time-saving portion of what APIMATIC does best--generate SDKs in 10 separate programming language and platform environments. Once your API definition validates, you can select to generate in their preferred language.</p>
<p><a href="http://apimatic.io"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_04_at_4.45.42_pm.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual Studio </strong>- A class library project for Portable and Universal Windows Platform</li>
<li><strong>Eclipse</strong> - A compatible maven project for Java 5 and above</li>
<li><strong>Android Studio -</strong> A compatible Gradle project for Android Gingerbread and above</li>
<li><strong>XCode</strong> - A project based on CoCoaPods for iOS 6 and above</li>
<li><strong>PSR-4 </strong>- A compliant library with Composer dependency manager</li>
<li><strong>Python</strong> - A package compatible with Python 2 and 3 using PIP as the dependency manager</li>
<li><strong>Angular </strong>- A lightweight SDK containing injectable wrappers for your API</li>
<li><strong>Node.js -</strong> A client library project in Node.js as an NPM package</li>
<li><strong>Ruby </strong>- A project to create a gem library your API based on Ruby&gt;=2.0.0</li>
<li><strong>Go</strong> - A client library project for Go language (v1.4)</li>
</ul>
<p>APIMATIC takes their SDKs seriously. They make sure they aren't just&nbsp;low-quality auto-generated&nbsp;code. I've seen the overtime they put into make sure the code they produce matches the styling and the reality on the ground for each language and environment being depoyed.</p>
<p><strong>Github Integration</strong><br />Deploying your API SDKs to Github is nothing new, but being able to autogenerate your SDK from a variety of API definition languages, and then publish to Github opens up a whole new world of possibilities. This is when Github can become a sort of API definition driven engine that can be installed into not just the API life cycle, but also every web, mobile, device, bot, voice, or any other client that puts an API to use.</p>
<p>This is where we start moving beyond SDK for me, into the realm of what APIMATIC is calling a DX Kit. APIMATIC isn't just dumping some auto-generated code into the Github repo of your choice. They are publishing the code, and now complete documentation for the SDK to a Github README, so that any human can come along and learn about what it does, as well as any other system can also come along and put the API definition auto-generated code to work.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Integration</strong><br />The evolution of the SDK continues with...well, continuous integration, and orchestration. If you go under the settings for your API in APIMATIC, you now also have the option to publish configuration files for four leading CI solutions:</p>
<p><a href="http://apimatic.io"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/apimatic_dx_kits.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><label class="small-label-thin"><strong>Generate Appveyor</strong> -&nbsp;</label><label class="small-label-light" for="GenerateAppveyorConfig">Generate Appveyor configuration file?</label></li>
<li><label class="small-label-thin"><strong>Generate CircleCI </strong>-&nbsp;</label><label class="small-label-light" for="GenerateCircleConfig">Generate CircleCI configuration file?</label></li>
<li><label class="small-label-thin"><strong>Generate Jenkins</strong> -&nbsp;</label><label class="small-label-light" for="GenerateJenkinsConfig">Generate Jenkins configuration file?</label></li>
<li><strong><label class="small-label-thin">Generate Travis -&nbsp;</label></strong><label class="small-label-light" for="GenerateTravisConfig">Generate Travis CI configuration file?</label></li>
</ul>
<p>APIMATIC had already opened up beyond just doing SDKs with the release of their API Transformer solution, and their introduction of detailed documentation for each kit (SDK) on Github. Now they are pushing into API testing and orchestration areas by allowing you to publish the required config files for the CI platform of your choosing.</p>
<p>I feel like their approach represents the expanding world of API consumption. Providing an API and SDK is not enough anymore. You have to provide and encourage healthy documentation, testing, and continuous integration practices as well. APIMATIC is aiming to&nbsp;"simplify API Consumption", with their DX Kits, which is a very positive thing for the API space, and worth highlighting as part of <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">my API SDK research</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_04_at_11.24.39_am.png" alt="" width="48%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I recently carved out some time to read&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.07108v1.pdf">A Web API ecosystem through feature-based reuse</a> by Ruben Verborgh (@RubenVerborgh) and Michel Dumontier. It is a lengthy, very academic proposal on how we can address the fact that "the current Web API landscape does not scale well: every API requires its own hardcoded clients in an unusually short-lived, tightly coupled relationship of highly subjective quality."</p>
<p>I highly recommend reading their proposal, as there are a lot of very useful patterns and suggestions in there that you can put to use in your operations. The paper centers around the notion that the web has succeeded because we were able to better consider interface reuse, and were able to identify the most effective patterns using analytics, and pointing out that there really is no equivalent to web analytics for measuring an APIs effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In order to evolve Web API design from an art into a discipline with measurable outcomes, we propose an ecosystem of reusable interaction patterns similar to those on the human Web, and a task-driven method of measuring those.</em></p>
<p>To help address these challenges in the world of web APIs, Verborgh and Dumontier propose that we work to build web interfaces, similar to what we do with the web, employing a bottom-up to composing reusable features such as full-text search, auto-complete, file uploads,&nbsp;etc.--in order to unlock the benefits of bottom-up interfaces, they propose 5 interface design principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Web APIs consist of features that implement a common interface</li>
<li>Web APIs partition their interface to maximize feature reuse.</li>
<li>Web API responses advertise the presence of each relevant feature</li>
<li>Each feature describes its own invocation and functionality.</li>
<li>The impact a feature on a Web API should be measured across implementations.</li>
</ol>
<p>They provide us with a pretty well thought out vision involving implementations and frameworks, and the sharing of documentation, while universally applying metrics for being able to identify the successful patterns. It provides us with a compelling, "feature-based method to construct the interface of Web APIs, favoring reuse&nbsp;overreinvention, analogous to component-driven interaction design on the human Web."</p>
<p>I support everything they propose. I cannot provide any critique on the technical merits of their vision. However, I find it lacks an awareness of the current business&nbsp;and political landscape that I find regularly present in the hypermedia, and linked data material I consume.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the business and political considerations that contribute to the situation we find ourselves in that&nbsp;Verborgh and Dumontier are focused on, which will also work to slow the adoption of their proposed vision:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Venture Capital</strong> - The current venture capital driven climate does not incentivize sharing and reuse, and their startups investing time and energy into web technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Intellectual Property </strong>- Modern views of the intellectual property, partially fueled by VC investment, but further exacerbated by legal cases like Oracle v Google force developers and designers to hold patterns close to their chest, limiting sharing and reuse again.</li>
<li><strong>Lazy Developers -</strong> Not all developers are knowledge seekers like the authors of this paper, and myself, many are just looking to get the job done&nbsp;and get home. There are few rewards for contributing back to the community, and once I have mine, I'm done.</li>
<li><strong>The Web Is Shit </strong>- One area that linked data and hypermedia folks tend to lose me is their&nbsp;focus on modeling things after the web. I agree the web is "working", but I don't know which one you use, but the one I use is shit, and only getting worse--have you scraped web content lately?</li>
<li><strong>Metrics &amp; Analytics - </strong>Google Analytics started out providing us with a set of tools to measure what works and doesn't work when it comes to the parts and pieces of our websites, but now it just does that for advertising. Also we do have analytics in the API space, but due to the other areas cited above, there is no sharing of this wisdom across the space.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of areas I regularly see working against the API design, definition, and hypermedia areas of the space, and will flood in slow the progress of their web API ecosystem vision. It doesn't mean I'm not supportive. I see the essence of a number of positive things present in their proposal, like reuse, sharing, and measurement. I feel the essence of existing currents in the world of APIs like microservices, DevOps, and continuous integration (aka <a href="http://orchestration.apievangelist.com/">orchestration</a>).</p>
<p>My mission, as it has been since 2010, is make sure really smart folks like Ruben and&nbsp;Michel at institutions, startups, and the enterprise better understand the business and political currents that are flowing around them. It can be very easy to miss significant signals around the currents influencing what is working, or not working with APIs when you are heads down working on a product, or razor focused on getting your degree within an institution. The human aspects of this conversation are always well cited, but I'm thinking we aren't always honest about the human elements present on the API side of the equation. Web != API &amp; API !=Web.</p>

<p>Your API definitions aren't just driving the API documentation on your website. They are being used across the API life cycle. I am using them fire up and playing with your API in <a href="http://getpostman.com">Postman</a>, generating SDKs using <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a>, or creating a <a href="https://getsandbox.com/">development sandbox</a> so I do not have to develop against your&nbsp;live environment.

<p>APIs can help make technology better serve us humans&nbsp;when you execute them thoughtfully. This is one of the main reasons I kicked off API Evangelist in 2010. I know that many of my technologist friends like to dismiss me in this area, but this is more about their refusal to give up the power they possess&nbsp;than it is ever about APIs.</p>
<p>I have been working professionally with databases since the 1980s, and have seen the many ways in which data and power go together, and how technology is used as smoke and mirrors as opposed to serving human beings. One of the ways people keep data for themselves is to make it seem big, complicated, and only something a specific group of people (white men with beards (wizards)) can possibly&nbsp;make work.</p>
<p>There is a great excerpt from a story by Sara M. Watson (<a href="https://twitter.com/smwat">@smwat</a>), called <a href="http://dismagazine.com/discussion/73298/sara-m-watson-metaphors-of-big-data/">Data is the New &ldquo;___&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;that sums up this for me:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The dominant industrial metaphors for data do not privilege the position of the individual. Instead, they take power away from the person to which the data refers and give it to those who have the tools to analyze and interpret data. Data then becomes obscured, specialized, and distanced.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We need a new framing of a personal, embodied relationship to data. Embodied metaphors have the potential to bring big data back down to a human scale and ground data in lived experience, which in turn, will help to advance the public&rsquo;s investment, interpretation, and understanding of our relationship to our data.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>DATA IS A MIRROR portrays data as something to reflect on and as a technology for seeing ourselves as others see us. But, like mirrors, data can be distorted, and can drive dysmorphic thought.</em></p>
<p>This is API for me. The desire to invest, interpret, and understand our relationship to our data is <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>. This is why I believe in the potential of APIs, even if the reality of it all often leaves me underwhelmed. There is no reason that the databases have to be obscured, specialized, and distant. If we want to craft meaningful interfaces for our data we can. If we want to craft useful interfaces for our data, that anyone can understand and put to work without specialized skills--we can.</p>
<p>The problem in this process is often complicated through our legacy practices, the quest for profits, or there are vendor-driven objectives in the way of properly defining and opening up frictionless access to our data. Our relationships with our data are out of alignment because it is serving business and technological masters, and do not actually benefit the humans whom it should be serving.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobileanalytics/latest/ug/welcome.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/aws_coding_analytics.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am seeing more <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobileanalytics/latest/ug/welcome.html">examples of analytics at the API client and SDK level</a>, providing more access to what is going on at this layer of the API stack. I'm seeing API providers build them into the analytics they provider for API consumers, and more analytic services from providers for the web, mobile, and device endpoints. Many companies are selling these features in the name of awareness, but in most cases, I'm guessing it is about adding another point of data generation which can then be monetized (IoT is a gold rush!).</p>
<p>As I do, I wanted to step back from this movement&nbsp;and look at it from many different dimensions, broken down into two distinct buckets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Positive(s)</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>More information -</strong> More data than can be analyzed</li>
<li><strong>More awareness -</strong> We will have visibility across integrations.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time insights -</strong> Data can be gathered on real time basis.</li>
<li><strong>More revenue - </strong>There will be more revenue opportunities&nbsp;here.</li>
<li><strong>More personalization - </strong>We can personalize the experience for each client.</li>
<li><strong>Fault Tolerance -</strong> There are opportunities for building in API fault tolerance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Negative(s)</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>More information -</strong> If it isn't used it can become a liability.</li>
<li><strong>More latency </strong>- This layer slows down the primary objective.</li>
<li><strong>More code complexity - </strong>Introduces added complexity for devs.</li>
<li><strong>More security consideration -</strong> We just created a new exploit opportunity.</li>
<li><strong>More privacy concerns -</strong> There are new privacy concerns facing end-users.</li>
<li><strong>More regulatory concerns -</strong> In some industries, it will be under scrutiny.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I can understand why we want to increase the analysis and awareness at this level of the API stack. I'm a big fan of building in resiliency in our clients &amp; SDKs, but I think we have to weigh the positive and negatives before jumping in. Sometimes I think we are too willing to introduce unnecessary&nbsp;code, data gathering, and potentially opening up security and privacy holes chasing new ways we can make money.</p>
<p>I'm guessing it will come down to each SDK, and the API resources that are being put to work. I'll be aggregating the different approaches I am seeing as part of my <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">API SDK research</a> and try to provide a more coherent glimpse at what providers are up to. By doing this, I'm hoping I can better understand some of the motivations behind this increased level of analytics being injected at the client and SDK level.</p>

<p>A new way that I am discovering the new tech services that the cool kids are using is from the dedicated integrations pages of API service providers I track on. Showcasing the services your platform integrates with is a great way of educating consumers about what the possibilities are when it comes to your tools and services. It is also a great way for analysts like me to connect the dots around which services are most important to the average user.</p>
<p>API service providers like <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/product/integrations/">DataDog</a>, <a href="https://www.opsclarity.com/product/integrations/">OpsClarity</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="https://pingometer.com/integrations/">Pingometer</a>&nbsp;are providing dedicated integration pages showcasing the other 3rd party platforms they integrate with. Alpha API dogs like Runscope also have <a href="https://www.runscope.com/docs/api/integrations">integration APIs</a>, allowing you to get a list of integrations your team depends on (perfect for another story). I'm just getting going tracking on tracking the existence of these integration pages, but each time I have come across one lately I find myself stopping and looking through each of the services included.</p>
<p>Directly, API integrations provide a great way to inform customers about which of the other services they use can be integrated with this platform, potentially adding to the number of reasons why they might choose to go with a service. Indirectly, API integration pages provide a great way to inform the sector about which API driven platforms are important to service providers, and their customers. After I get a number of these integration pages bookmarked as part of my research, I will work on other stories showcasing the various approaches I find.</p>

<p>I'm always looking for specific API providers to showcase as examples we can follow when crafting different portions of our API strategies. The Amazon Alexa team is doing a pretty kick ass job at blogging, and owning the conversation when it comes to developing conversational interfaces, so I thought I'd highlight them as an example to follow when planning the communications portion of your strategy.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/community/blog/tag/Alexa">the #Alexa tag for the AWS blog</a>. They have a regular stream of storytelling coming out of the platform. Its a mix of talking about the tech of the platform, and showcasing what it can do. What really captured my attention for this story is there regular showcasing of the interesting solutions developers are building on top of the platform. Many platform blogs I read are a one trick pony, just talking about their service, and I think the AWS Alexa team has found a compelling blend.</p>
<p>Ok, AWS probably has just a few more resources than your API team, but trust me, one person can do a lot when they are really engaged. I produce at least five posts a day (ok, they are ranty and weird), and always work to keep thing as diverse as possible, and not about my products or services (fact I don't have any probably helps as well). I do not recommend you using API Evangelist as a model for your platform blogging. I do recommend you use Amazon Alex as a model for how you can create a compelling API platform communication experience.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/26/my-api-definitions-are-incomplete-but-you-do-not-want-to-contribute/">I wrote a post about the emails I get from folks telling me the API definitions contained within my API stack research</a>, something that has helped me better see why it is I do API definitions. I go through APIs and craft OpenAPI Specs for them because it helps me understand the value each company offers, while also helping me discover interesting APIs&nbsp;and the healthy practices behind them.</p>
<p>The reason <a href="http://theapistack.com/">I create API definitions and organize them into collections is all about discovery</a>. While some of the APIs I will be putting to use, most of them just help me&nbsp;better understand the world of APIs&nbsp;and the value and the intent behind the companies who are doing the most interesting things in the space.</p>
<p>I would love it if all <a href="http://theapistack.com/certifying/">my API definitions were 100% certified</a>, and included complete information about the request, response, and security models, but just having the surface area defined makes me happy. My intention is to try and provide as complete of a definition as possible, but the primary stop along the API lifecycle I'm looking to serve is <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">discovery</a>, with other ones like <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">mocking</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">testing</a>, <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">SDKs</a>, and others following after that.</p>
<p>Maybe if we can all better understand the different reasons behind why&nbsp;we all craft and maintain API definitions we can better leverage Github to help make more of them complete. For now, I'll keep working on my definitions, and if you want to contribute head over to <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">the Github repo for my work</a>, and share any of your own definitions, or <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack/issues">submit an issue</a> about which APIs you'd like to see included.</p>

<p>I was <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/organizations/">profiling the New Relic API</a> and came across their <a href="https://newrelic.com/synthetics">Synthetics service</a>,which is a testing and monitoring solution that lets you&nbsp;"s<span>end calls to your APIs to make sure each output and system response are successfully returned from multiple locations around the world"--pretty straight forward monitoring stuff. The name is what caught my attention, and got me thinking the data and content that we run through our APIs.</span></p>
<p>Virtualization feels like it defines the levers and gears our API-driven systems, and synthetics feels like it speaks to the data and content that flows through&nbsp;flows through these systems. It feels like everything in the API stack should be able to be virtualized, and sandboxes, including the data and content, which is the lifeblood--allowing us to test&nbsp;and monitor everything.</p>
<p>It also seems like another reason we'd want to share our data schemas, as well as employ common ones like <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>, so that others can create synthetic data and content sets for variety of scenarios--then API providers could put these sets to work in testing and monitoring their operations. A sort of synthetic data and content marketplace for the growing world of API testing and monitoring.</p>
<p>I see that New Relic has the name Synthetics trademarked, so I'll have to play around with variations to describe the data and the content portion of <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com/">my API virtualization research</a>. I'll use virtualization to describe gears of the engine, and something along the lines of synthetic data and content to describe everything that we run through it. I am just looking for ways to better describe the different approaches I am seeing, and tell more stories about API virtualization, and sandboxing in ways that resonate with folks.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_02_at_11.04.26_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of the reasons I enjoy profiling APIs is that they give an honest view of what a company does, absent of all the marketing fluff, and the promises that I see from each wave of startups. If designed right, APIs can provide a very functional, distilled down representation of data, content, and algorithmic resources of any company. Some APIs can be very fluffy and verbose, but the good ones are simple, concise, and straight to the point.</p>
<p>As I'm <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/organizations/">profiling the APIs for the companies included in my API monitoring research</a>, what&nbsp;API Science, Apica, API Metrics, BMC Software, DataDog, New Relic, and <a href="https://www.runscope.com">Runscope</a> offer quickly become pretty clear. A simple list of valuable resources you can put to use when monitoring your APIs. Crafting an OpenAPI Spec allows me to define each of these companies APIs, and easily articulate what it is that they do--minus all the bullshit that often comes with the businesses side of all of this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel like the detail I include for each company in an APIs.json&nbsp;file provides a nice view of the intent behind an API, while the details I put into the OpenAPI Spec provide insight into whether or not a company actually has any value behind this intent. It can be frustrating to wade through the amount of information some providers feel they need to publish as API documentation, but it all becomes worth it once I have the distilled down OpenAPI Spec, giving an honest view of what each company does.</p>

<p>I am spending some time profiling the companies who are part of my API monitoring research, specifically learning about <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/organizations/">the APIs they offer as part of their solutions</a>. I do this work so that I can better understand what API monitoring service providers are offering, but also for the discoveries I make along the way--this is how I keep API Evangelist populated with stories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An interesting API I came across during this work was from the <a href="https://www.site24x7.com">Site24X7 monitoring service</a>, specifically <a href="https://www.site24x7.com/help/api/#sla-settings">their service level agreement (SLA) API</a>. An API for adding, managing, and reporting against SLA's that you establish as part of the monitoring of your APIs. Providing a pretty interesting API pattern that seems like it should be part of the default API management stack for all API providers.</p>
<p>This would allow API providers to manage SLA's for their operations, but also potentially expose this layer for each consumer of the API, letting them understand SLA"s that are in place, and whether or not they have been met--in a way that could be seamlessly integrated with existing systems. An API for SLA management for API providers seems like it could also be a standalone operation as well, helping broker this layer of the API economy, and provide a rating system for how well API providers are holding up their end of the API contract.</p>
