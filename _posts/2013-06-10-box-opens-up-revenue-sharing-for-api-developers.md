{% include JB/setup %}<p>Enterprise content sharing platform box launched a new developer revenue sharing program for its API developer ecosystem, called $rev.Box $rev is pretty straightforward.You just integrate the Box API into your app, enroll it into the Box $rev program, and box will monitor, track and report your activity--sending you checks for up to 15% of the per seat price as a commission, each quarter.As a PaaS provider, the core value driven by the box API is not about making money, it is based upon adding new users, and getting them to depend on box for their everyday needs.Offering developers 15% of the revenue generated via the core box platforms makes a lot of sense.</p>
