{% include JB/setup %}<p>Peter Gruenbaum of SDK Bridge shared an article in the companys November newsletter that resonated with some of the work Ive been doing recently -- creating API documentation for the Mimeo Connect REST Print API.The article is titled A Coders Guide to Writing API Documentation and appeared in MSDN Magazine.Gruenbaum says that writing good API documentation requires the four components: Overview: Explaining what advantages developers have in using the platform, and in some cases, providing an architectural description of the platform.Getting started: Helping the developer get started, in the form of step-by-step tutorials or simpler walkthroughs.Sample code: Providing well-commented code samples that developers can build on.</p>
