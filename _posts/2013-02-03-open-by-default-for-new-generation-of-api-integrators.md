{% include JB/setup %}<p>I did a presentation at the DC API Meetup, when I was in Washington DC last week.My talk was some of my usual material around the history, business and politics of APIs, but included a section on trends, where I covered some of the newer aggregation providers like Singly, BaaS providers like Parse and automation tools like IFTTT.At the end of the meetup, we did a QA panel session, and Javaun Moradi (@javaun), product manager at NPR digital, made a great point about the reliability and stability of this new generation of third party platforms building aggregate, backend, automation or other types of providers who are in turn, dependent on other API providers.Javaun questioned the reliability of this new generation of startups, who are newly funded, most likely not yet profitable, dependent on other APIs, and are most likely going to be acquired later on down the road, or go out of business when funding runs out.Javaun felt that established players like Salesforce and Google are here to stay, you know they arenâ€™t going anywhere--where a new startup has greater potential for service disruption and instability.</p>
