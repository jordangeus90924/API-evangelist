			<p><em>14 Feb 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m regularly surprised by companies who are doing microservices which are failing to see the need the change organizational culture, and that microservices will be some magic voodoo to fix all their legacy technical debt. That simply decoupling and breaking down the technology, without any re-evaluation of the business and politics behind, will fix everything, and set the company, organizations, institution, or government agency on a more positive trajectory. In coming years, we will continue to hear stories about why microservices do not work, from endless waves or groups who were unable to do the hard work to decouple, and reorganize the operations behind the services they provide. The monolith legacy systems I’m seeing targeted are widely seen as purely technology, which is why it is often labeled as technical debt. What is missing from this targeting and labeling is any acknowledgement of the people and decisions behind the monolith. The years of business, political, and cultural investment into the monolith. How will we every unwind, or properly address the monolith, if we do not see the organizational, human, and business aspects of why it exists in the first place? Are we talking about the business decisions that went into creating and perpetuating the monolith? It is highly likely we will be making some of the same decisions with microservices, which could end up being worse than when we made them with a single system. Distributed mess, is often more painful than consolidated mess. I’m seeing endless waves of large organizations mandating that their teams invest in microservices, with no mandating for microteams, microbudgets, microdecisionmaking, or any of the other decoupling needed to make microservices truly work independently. I attach micro as a joke. I really don’t feel micro is the constant that needs applying when it comes to services, or the business and organizational mechanism behind them. However, it is the word du jour, and one that gets at some of the illnesses our...[<a href="/2018/02/14/your-microservices-effort-will-fail-because-you-will-never-decouple-your/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>14 Feb 2018</em></p>
			<p>When you are operating an API, you are always looking for new ways to be discovered. I study this aspect of operating APIs from the flip-side–how do I find new APIs, and stay in tune with what APIs are to? Historically we find APIs using ProgrammableWeb, Google, and Twitter, but increasingly Github is where I find the newest, coolest APIs. I do a lot of searching via Github for API related topics, but increasingly Github topics themselves are becoming more valuable within search engine indexes, making them an easy way to uncover interesting APIs. I was profiling the market data API Alpha Vantage today, and one of the things I always do when I am profiling an API, is I conduct a Google, and then secondarily, a Github search for the APIs name. Interestingly, I found a list of Github Topics while Googling for Alpha Vantage API, uncovering some interesting SDKs, CLI, and other open source solutions that have been built on top of the financial data API. Showing the importance of operating your API on Github, but also working to define a set of standard Github Topic tags across all your projects, and helping encourage your API community to use the same set of tags, so that their projects will surface as well. I consider Github to be the most important tool in an API providers toolbox these days. I know as an API analyst, it is where I learn the most about what is really going on. It is where I find the most meaningful signals that allow me to cut through the noise that exists on Google, Twitter, and other channels. Github isn’t just for code. As I mention regularly, 100% of my work as API Evangelist lives within hundreds of separate Github repositories. Sadly, I don’t spend as much time as I should tagging, and organizing projects into meaningful topic areas, but it is something I’m going to be investing in...[<a href="/2018/02/14/the-growing-importance-of-github-topics-for-your-api-seo/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>14 Feb 2018</em></p>
			<p>Over 50% of the projects I consult on still generate OpenAPI (fka Swagger) from code, rather then the other way around. When I first begin working with any API development group as an advisor, strategist, or governance architect I always ask, “are you using OpenAPI?” Luckily the answer is almost always yes. The challenge is that most of the time they don’t understand the full scope of how to use OpenAPI, and are still opting for the more costly approach–writing code, then generating OpenAPI from annotations. It has been over five years since Jakub Nesetril(@jakubnesetril) of Apiary first decoupled this way of doing API design first, but clearly we still have a significant amount of work when it comes to API definition and design literacy amongst development groups. When you study where API services and tooling are headed it is clear that API deployment, and the actual writing of code is getting pushed further down in the life cycle. Services like Stoplight.io, and Postman are focusing on enabling a design, mock, document, test, and iterate approach, with API definitions (OpenAPI, Postman, etc) at the core. The actual deployment of API, either using open source frameworks, API gateways, or other method, is coming into the picture more downstream. Progressive API teams are hammering out exactly the API they need without ever writing any code, making sure the API design is dialed in before the more expensive, and often permanent code gets written and sent to production. You will see me hammering on this line of API design first messaging on API Evangelist over the next year. Many developers still see OpenAPI (fka Swagger) about generating API documentation, not as the central contract that is used across every stop along the API lifecycle. Most do not understand that you can mock instead of deploying, and even provide mock data, errors, and other scenarios, allowing you to prototype applications on top of API designs. It will take a...[<a href="/2018/02/14/code-generation-of-openapi-fka-swagger-still-the-prevailing-approach/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>14 Feb 2018</em></p>
			<p>I was providing an overview of Kong, AWS API Gateway, and other solutions for a team I’m advising a couple weeks back. I was just looking to distill down some of the key features, and provide an overview to a large, distributed team. This work lends itself well to publishing here on the blog, so I published an overview of Kong yesterday, and today I wanted to publish the summary of the AWS API Gateway. The API gateway solution from AWS has some overlap with what Kong delivers, but I consider it to be more of an API deployment, as well as an API management gateway. The AWS API Gateway brings API deployment front and center, allowing you to define and deploy APIs that are wired up to your backend (AWS) infrastructure: API Endpoint - a host name of the API. the API endpoint can be edge-optimized or regional, depending on where the majority of your API traffic originates from. You choose a specific endpoint type when creating an API. Backend Endpoint - A backend endpoint is also referred to as an integration endpoint and can be a Lambda function, an HTTP webpage, or an AWS service action, or a mock interface. Swagger / OpenAPI - Using Swagger to import and export API configuration and definitions. Then the gateway brings a wealth of API management features, providing a look at how it has been baked into the cloud now: Accounts - Creation and management of Accounts. Keys - Creation and management of API Keys Certificates - Adding and management of certifications Documentation - Publishing of ApI documentation Domains - Mapping of domains Response - Custom Gateway responses. Models - Management of schema models. Validation - Validation of API requests SDK Generation - Generating of client SDKs Staging - Establishing of stages Tags - Tagging of resources Templates - Mapping template used to transform a payload. Plans - Establishing of different plans for API usage. VPC...[<a href="/2018/02/14/a-summary-of-aws-api-gateway-as-an-api-deployment-and-management-solution/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Feb 2018</em></p>
			<p>Working with Streamdata.io has forced a shift in how I see the API landscape. When I started working with their proxy I simply saw it about doing API in real time. I was hesitant because not every API had real time needs, so I viewed what they do as just a single tool in my API toolbox. While Server-Sent Events, and proxying JSON APIs is just one tool in my toolbox, like the rest of the tools in my toolbox it forces me to think through what an API does, and understand where it exists in the landscape, and where the API provider exists in their API journey. Something I’m hoping the API providers are also doing, but I enjoy doing from the outside-in as well. Taking any data, content, media, or algorithm and exposing as an API, is a journey. It is about understanding what that resource is, what it does, and what it means to the provider and the consumer. What this looks like day one, will be different from what it looks like day 365 (hopefully). If done right, you are engaging with consumers, and evolving your definition of the resource, and what is possible when you apply it programmatically through the interfaces you provide. API providers who do this right, are leveraging feedback loops in place with consumers, iterating on their APIs, as well as the resources they provide access to, and improving upon them. Just doing simple web APIs puts you on this journey. As you evolve along this road you will begin to also apply other tools. You might have the need for webhooks to start responding to meaningful events that are beginning to emerge across the API landscape, and start doing the work of defining your event-driven architecture, developing lists of most meaningful topics, and events that are occurring across your evolving API platform. Webhooks provide direct value by pushing data and content to your API consumers, but...[<a href="/2018/02/13/streaming-and-eventdriven-architecture-represents-maturity-in-the-api-journey/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Feb 2018</em></p>
			<p>I am profiling US, UK, French, and German banks as part of some research I am doing for Streamdata.io. I am profiling how far along in the API journey these banks are, and one clear differentiator for me is whether a bank has a developer.[bankdomain] subdomain setup for their APIs or not. The banks that have a dedicated subdomain for their API operations have a clear lead over those who do not. The domain doesn’t do much all by itself, but it is clear that when a bank can get this decision made, many of the other decisions that need to be made are also happening in tandem. This isn’t unique just to banking. This is something I’ve written about several times over the years, and remains constant after looking at thousands of APIs over the last eight years. When a company’s API presence exists within the help section of their website, the API is almost always secondary to the core business. When a company relies on a 3rd party service for their API and developer presence, it almost always goes dormant after a couple months, showing that APIs are just not a priority within the company. Having a dedicated subdomain, landing page, and set of resources dedicated to doing APIs goes a long way towards ensuring an API program gains the momentum it needs to be successful within an organization, and industry. I know that having a dedicated subdomain for API operations seems like a small thing to many folks. However, it is one of the top symptoms of a successful API in my experience. Making data, content, and algorithms available in a machine readable way for use in other applications by 3rd party via the web is something every company, organization, institution, and government agency should be doing in 2018. It is the next iteration of the web, and is not something that should be a side project.

			<p><em>13 Feb 2018</em></p>
			<p>Github is the number one signal in my API world. The activity that occurs via Github is more important than anything I find across Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social channels. Commits to repositories and the other social activity that occurs around coding projects is infinitely more valuable, and telling regarding what a company is up to, than the deliberate social media signals blasted out via other channels is. I’m always working to dial in my monitoring of Github using the Github API, but also via the RSS feeds that are present on the public side of the platform. I feel RSS is often overlooked as an API data source, but I find that RSS is not only alive and well in 2018, it is something that is actively used on many platforms. The problem with RSS for me, is the XML isn’t always conducive to working with in many of my JavaScript enabled applications, and I also tend to want to aggregate, filter, and translate RSS feeds into more meaningful JSON. To help me accomplish this for Github, I crafted a simple PHP RSS aggregator and converter script which I can run in a variety of situations. I published the basic script to Github as a Gist, for easy reference. The simple PHP script just takes an array of Github users, loops through them, pulls their RSS feeds, and then aggregates them into a single array, sorts by date, and then outputs as JSON. It is a pretty crude JSON API, but it provides me with what I need to be able to use these RSS feeds in a variety of other applications. I’m going to be mining the feeds for a variety of signals, including repo and user information, which I can then use within other applications. The best part is this type of data mining doesn’t require a Github API key, and is publicly available, allowing me to scale up much further...[<a href="/2018/02/13/aggregating-multiple-github-account-rss-feeds-into-single-json-api-feed/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Feb 2018</em></p>
			<p>I was breaking down what the API management solution Kong delivers for a customer of mine, and I figured I’d take what I shared via the team portal, and publish here on the blog. It is an easy way for me to create content, and make my consulting work more transparent here on the blog. I am using Kong as part of several healthcare and financial projects currently, and I am actively employing it to ensure customers are properly managing their APIs. I wasn’t the decision maker on any of these projects when it came to choosing the API management layer, I am just the person who is helping standardize how they are using API services and tooling across the API life cycle for these projects. First, Kong is an open source API management solution with an easy to install community edition, and enterprise level support when needed. They provide an admin interface, and developer portal for the API management proxy, but there is also a growing number of community editions like KongDash, and Konga emerging to make it a much more richer ecosystem. And of course, Kong has an API for managing the API management layer, as every API service and tooling provider should have. Now, let’s talk about what Kong does for helping in the deploying of your APIs: API Routing - The API object describes an API that’s being exposed by Kong. Kong needs to know how to retrieve the API when a consumer is calling it from the Proxy port. Each API object must specify some combination of hosts, uris, and methods Consumers - The Consumer object represents a consumer - or a user - of an API. You can either rely on Kong as the primary datastore, or you can map the consumer list with your database to keep consistency between Kong and your existing primary datastore. Certificates - A certificate object represents a public certificate/private key pair for an...[<a href="/2018/02/13/a-summary-of-kong-as-an-api-management-solution/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>12 Feb 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve been evolving an observability ranking for the APIs I track on for a couple years now. I’ve bene using the phrase to describe my API profiling and measurement approach since I first learned about the concept from Stripe. There are many perspectives floating around the space about what observability means in the context of technology, however mine is focused completely on APIs, and is more about communicating with external stakeholders, more than it is just about monitoring of systems. To recap, the Wikipedia definition for observability is: Formally, a system is said to be observable if, for any possible sequence of state and control vectors, the current state can be determined in finite time using only the outputs (this definition is slanted towards the state space representation). Less formally, this means that from the system’s outputs it is possible to determine the behavior of the entire system. If a system is not observable, this means the current values of some of its states cannot be determined through output sensors. Most of the conversations occurring in the tech sector are focused on monitoring operations, and while this is a component of my definition, I lean more heavily on the observing occurring beyond just internal groups, and observability being about helping keep partners, consumers, regulators, and other stakeholders be more aware regarding how complex systems work, or do not work. I feel that observability is critical to the future of algorithms, and making sense of how technology is impacting our world, and APIs will play a critical role in ensuring that the platforms have the external outputs required for delivering meaningful observability. When it comes to quantifying the observability of platforms and algorithms, the more outputs available the better. Everything should have APIs for determining the inputs and outputs of any algorithm, or other system, but there should also be operational level APIs that give insight into the underlying compute, storage, logging, DNS, and other layers...[<a href="/2018/02/12/more-outputs-are-better-when-it-comes-to-establishing-an-api-observability/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>12 Feb 2018</em></p>
			<p>I am profiling a number of market data APIs as part of my research with Streamdata.io. As I work my way through the process of profiling APIs I am always looking for other interesting ideas for stories on API Evangelist. One of the things I noticed while profiling Alpha Vantage, was that they highlighted their high usage APIs with prominent, very colorful labels. One of the things I’m working to determine in this round of profiling is how “real time” APIs are, or aren’t, and the high usage label adds another interesting dimension to this work. While reviewing API documentation it is nice to have labels that distinguish APIs from each other. Alpha Vantage has a fairly large number of APIs so it is nice to be able to focus on the ones that are used the most, and are more popular. For example, as part of my profiling I focused on the high usage technical indicator APIs, rather than profiling all of them. I need to be able to prioritize my work, and these labels helped me do that. Providing one example of the benefit that these types of labels can bring to the table. I’m guessing that there are many other time saving aspects of labeling popular APIs, beyond just saving me time. This type of labeling is an interesting way of externalizing API analytics in my opinion. Which is another interesting concept to think about across API operations. How can you take the most meaningful data points across your API management processes, and distill them down, externalize and share them so that your API consumers can benefit from valuable API metrics? In this context, I could see a whole range of labels that could be established, applied to interactive documentation using OpenAPI tags, and made available across API documentation, helping make APIs even more dynamic, and in sync with how they are actually being used, measured, and making an impact on operations....[<a href="/2018/02/12/labeling-your-high-usage-apis-and-externalizing-api-metrics-within-your-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>12 Feb 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m profiling a large number of APIs right now, and I am ranking APIs based upon how easy or difficult they are to access. Whether or not an API provide has a business model is part of the ranking, and how clearly articulated the access and pricing is around that model is a critical part of my profiling algorithm. The APIs that end up included in the API gallery I’m developing for Streamdata.io, and available as part of my wider API Stack research will all have to possess easy to articulate access levels. Not all of them will be free, but the ones that cost money will have straightforward pricing that can be articulate in a single sentence–something that seems to be elusive with many of the API providers I am profiling. I am regularly confused regarding the myriad of ways in which API providers obfuscate the pricing for their APIs. I’ve long been weary of API providers who don’t have a clear business model, but when they have a pricing page, but bu do not consistently apply it to APIs, I’m just left confounded. I can’t always tell if it is done maliciously, or they just haven’t approached their API through an external lens. If I find a pricing page, and the plans seem reasonable, and I’ve plugged my credit card in, but then I still don’t have access to some APIs, and there is no clear labeling of which APIs I have access to as part of my plan, I just can’t spend the afternoon testing and seeing which APIs return a 403 to understand the landscape. The API service composition, and pricing tiers needs to be coherent and front and center, otherwise I just have to move on. If I can’t communicate what is going on to others, it won’t be included in my work. I do not have a problem with different tiers of access, as long as they are communicated,...[<a href="/2018/02/12/be-clear-about-your-api-pricing/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I get endless waves of people wanting to “guest post” on API Evangelist. It isn’t something I’m interested in because of the nature of API Evangelist, and that it really is just my own stream of consciousness, and not about selling any particular product or service. However, if you are an API provider, looking for quality content for your blog, having a formal approach to managing guest bloggers might make sense. Sure, you don’t want to accept all the spammy requests that you will get, but with the right process, you could increase the drumbeat around your API, and build relationships with your partners and API consumers. There is an example of this in action at the financial data marketplace Intrinio, with their official blogger program. The blogging program for the platform has a set of established benchmarks defined by the Intrinio team, to establish quality for any post that is accepted as part of the program. What I find really interesting, is that they also offer three months of free access to data feeds for API consumers who publish a post via the platform. “Exceptional” participants in the program may have their free access extended, and ALL participants will receive discounts on paid data access subscriptions via the platforms APIs. This is the type of value exchange I like to see via API platforms. Too many APIs are simple one way streets, paying for GET access to data, content, media, and algorithms. API management shouldn’t be just about about metering one way access and charging for it. Sensible API management should measure value exchange around ALL platform resources, including blog and forum posts, and other activities API providers should be incentivizing via their platforms. This is one of the negative side effects of REST I feel–too much focus on resources, and not about the events that occur around these resources. Something we are beginning to move beyond in an event-driven API landscape. Next, I...[<a href="/2018/02/12/a-dedicated-guest-blogger-program-for-your-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>06 Feb 2018</em></p>
			<p>I wrote an earlier article that basic API design guidelines are your first step towards API governance, but I wanted to introduce another first step you should be taking even before basic API design guides–cataloging all of your APIs. I’m regularly surprised by the number of companies I’m talking with who don’t even know where all of their APIs are. Sometimes, but not always, there is some sort of API directory or catalog in place, but often times it is out of date, and people just aren’t registering their APIs, or following any common approach to delivering APIs within an organization–hence the need for API governance. My recommendation is that even before you start thinking about what your governance will look like, or even mention the word to anyone, you take inventory of what is already happening. Develop an org chart, and begin having conversations. Identify EVERYONE who is developing APIs, and start tracking on how they are doing what they do. Sure, you want to get an inventory of all the APIs each individual or team is developing or operating, but you should also be documenting all the tooling, services, and processes they employ as part of their workflow. Ideally, there is some sort of continuous deployment workflow in place, but this isn’t a reality in many of the organization I work with, so mapping out how things get done is often the first order of business. One of the biggest failures of API governance I see is that the strategy has no plan for how we get from where we are to where we ant to be, it simply focuses on where we want to be. This type of approach contributes significantly to pissing people off right out of the gate, making API governance a lot more difficult. Stop focusing on where you want to be for a moment, and focus on where you are.

			<p><em>06 Feb 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m slowly categorizing all the APIs I find who are offering up some sort regional availability as part of their operations. With the easy of deployment using leading cloud services, it is something I am beginning to see more frequently. However, there is still a wide variety of reasons why an API provider will invest in this aspect of their operations, and I’m looking to understand more about what these motivations are. Sometimes it is because they are serving a global audience, and latency kills the experience, but other times I’m seeing it is more about the maturity of the API provider, and they’ve have such a large user base that they are getting more requests to deliver resources closer to home. The most recent API provider I have come across who is offering regional API endpoints is from Riot Games, the makers of League of Legends, who offers twelve separate regions for you to chose from, broken down using a variety of regional subdomains. The Riot Games API provides a wealth of meta data around their games, and while they don’t state their reasons for providing regional APIs, I’m guessing it is to make sure the meta data is localized to whichever country their customers are playing in. Reducing an latency across networks, making the overall gaming and supporting application experience as smooth and seamless as possible. Pretty standard reasons for doing regional APIs, and providing a simple example of how you do this at the DNS level. RIot Games also provides a regional breakdown of the availability of their regional endpoints on their API status page, adding another dimension to the regional API delivery conversation. If you are providing regional APIs, you should be monitoring them, and communicating this to your consumers. This is all pretty standard stuff, but I’m working to document every example of regional APIs I come across as part of my research.

			<p><em>06 Feb 2018</em></p>
			<p>One aspect of my talk at APIDays Paris this last week, included a slide about considering to allow API consumers to negotiate CSV responses from our API. Something that would probably NEVER occur to most API providers, and probably would make many even laugh at me. I’m used to it, and don’t care. While not something that every API provider should be considering, depending on the data you are serving up, and who your target API consumer ares, it is something that might make sense. Allowing for the negotiation of CSV responses represents lowering the bar for API consumption, and widening the audience who can put our APIs to work. I was doing more work around public data recently, and was introduced to an interesting look at some lessons from developing open data standards. I’m doing a deep dive into municipal data lately as part of my partnership with Streamdata.io, and I found the lessons they published interesting, and something that reflects my stance on API content negotiation. From the development and maintenance of the API, it quickly became clear that adjusting scripts after every election (and by-election) and website modification, was quickly becoming unsustainable. To address this issue, a simple CSV schema was developed to encourage standardisation of this data from the outset. The schema was designed to be as simple and easy to understand and implement as possible. Comprised of just 21 fields, 7 of which are recommended fields, the schema does not have hierarchical relationships between terms and can be implemented in a single CSV file. By making the standard this simple, we were able to get a number of adopters onboard and outputting their lists of elected representatives on their own open data portals. When it comes to APIs, simplicity rules. The simpler you can make your API, the more impact you will make. Allowing for the negotiation of CSV responses from your API when possible allows API consumers to go...[<a href="/2018/02/06/keeping-api-schema-simple-for-wider-adoption/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I recently watched a BBC documentary about the history of the branding used as part of the London Underground. I’m pretty absorbed lately with using public transit as an analogy for complex API implementations, and moving beyond just using subway maps, I thought the branding strategy for the London Underground provided other important lessons for API providers. The BBC documentary went into great detail regarding how much work was put into standardizing the font, branding, and presentation of information for each London Underground, to help reduce confusion, and help riders get where they needed, and making the city operate more efficiently. As I continue to study the world of API documentation, I think we have so much work ahead of us when it comes to standardizing how we present our API portals. Right now every API portal is different, even often times with multiple portals from the same company–see Amazon Web Services for example. I think we underestimate the damage this has to the overall API experience for consumers, and why we see API documentation like Swagger UI, Slate, and Read the Docs have such an impact. However this is just documentation, and we need this to occur as part of the wider API portal user experience. I’ve seen some standardized open source API portal solutions, and there are a handful of API portal services out there, but there really is no standard for how we deliver, brand, and operate the wider API experience. I have my minimum viable API portal definition, and have been tracking on the common building blocks of API operations for eight years now, but there are no “plug and play” solutions that users can implement, following any single approach. I have the data, and I even have a simple Twitter Bootstrap version of my definition (something I’m upgrading ASAP), but in my experience people get very, very, very hung up on the visual aspects of this conversation, want different visual...[<a href="/2018/02/06/consistency-in-branding-across-api-portals/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I’ve been trash talking APIs that identify me as part of some sort of sales funnel, and automate the decision around whether or not I get access to their API. My beef isn’t with API providers profiling me and making decisions about how much access I get, it is about them limiting profiles making it so I do not get access to their APIs at all. Their narrow definitions of the type of API consumers they are seeking does not include me, even though I have thousands of regular readers of my blog who do fit their profile. In the end, it is their loss, not mine, that they do not let me in, but the topic is still something I feel should be discussed out in the open, hopefully expanding the profile definitions for some API providers who may not have considered the bigger picture. I’ve highlighted the limiting profiling of API consumers that prevent access to APIs, but now I want to talk about how profiling can be sensibly used to limit access to API resources. Healthy API management always has an entry level tier, but what tiers are available after that often depend on a variety of other data points. One thing I see API providers regularly doing is requiring API consumers to provide more detail about who they are and what they are doing with an API. I don’t have any problem with API providers doing this, making educated and informed decisions regarding who an API consumer is or isn’t. As the API Evangelist I am happy to share more data points about me to get more access. I don’t necessarily want to do this to sign up for your entry level access tier, just so I can kick the tires, but if I’m needing deeper access, I am happy to fill our a fuller profile of myself, and what I am working on.

			<p>I am learning more about gRPC and HTTP/2, as part of the recent expansion of my API toolbox. I’m not a huge fan of Protocol Buffers, however I do get the performance gain they introduce, but I am very interested in learning more about how HTTP/2 is being used as a transport. While I’ve been studying how websockets, Kafka, MQTT, and other protocols have left the boundaries of HTTP and are embracing the performance gains available in the pure TCP realm, I’m more intrigued by the next generation of HTTP as a transport. Part of my learning process is all about understanding the headers available to us in the HTTP/2 realm. I’ve been learning more about the next generation HTTP headers from the gRPC Github repository which provides details on the request and response headers in play. HTTP/2 API Request Headers Request-Headers → Call-Definition *Custom-Metadata Call-Definition → Method Scheme Path TE [Authority] [Timeout] Content-Type [Message-Type] [Message-Encoding] [Message-Accept-Encoding] [User-Agent] Method → “:method POST” Scheme → “:scheme “ (“http” / “https”) Path → “:path” “/” Service-Name “/” {method name} # But see note below.

			<p>Streamdata.io is investing in my API Stack work as we build out their API Gallery of valuable data streaming APIs. I’m powering through hundreds of APIs and using my approach to profiling APIs that I have been developing over the last eight years of operating API Evangelist. I have a large number of APIs to get through, so I don’t have a lot of time to spend on each API. I am quickly profiling and ranking them to quickly identify which one’s are worth my time. While there are many elements that get in the way of me actually being able to obtain an API key and begin using an API, one of the more frustrating elements when API providers require me to jump on the phone with them before I can test drive any APIs. I’ve encountered numerous APIs that require me talk to a sales person before I can do anything. I know that y’all think this is savvy. This is how business is done these days, but it just isn’t the way you start conversations with API consumers. Sure, there should be support channels available when I need them, but it SHOULD NOT be the way you begin a conversation with us API consumers. I’ve heard all the reasons possible for why companies feel like they need to do this, and I guarantee that all of them are based upon out of date perspectives around what APIs are all about. Often times they are a bi-product of not having a modern API management solution in place, and a team that lacks a wider awareness of the API sector and how API operations works. In 2018, I shouldn’t have to talk to you on the phone to understand what your API does, and how it fits into what I’m working on. Most of the time I do not even know what I’m working on.

			<p>I am profiling market data APIs as part of my partnership with Streamdata.io. It is a process I enjoy, because it provides me with a number of interesting stories I can tell here on API Evangelist. Many of the APIs I profile just frustrate me, but there are always the gems who are doing interesting things with their APIs, and understand providing APIs, as well as consuming APIs. One API that I’ve been profiling, and I am able to put to use in my work to build a gallery of real time data APIs, was 1Forge. 1Forge provides dead simple APIs for accessing market data, and surprise!! – you can sign up for a key, and begin making API calls within minutes. It might not sound like that big of a deal, but after going through 25+ APIs, I only have about 5 API keys. I’m working on an OpenAPI definition for 1Forge, so I can begin to poll, and stream the data they make available, including it in the Streamdata.io API gallery I’m building. However, as I was getting up and running with the API, I noticed their quota endpoint, which allows me to check my usage quote with the 1Forge API–something that I thought was story worthy. The idea of an endpoint to check my applications usage quota for an API seems like a pretty fundamental concept, but sadly it is something I do not see very often. It is something that should be default for ALL APIs, but additionally I’d like to see a webhook for, letting me know when my API consumption reaches different levels. Since I’m talking about Streamdata.io, it would also make sense to offer a Server-Sent Event (SSE) for the API quote endpoint, allowing me to bake the usage quota for all the APIs I depend on into a single API dashboard–streaming real time usage information across the APIs depend on, and maybe displaying things in RED when...[<a href="/2018/02/05/api-quota-api-webhooks-and-serversent-events-sse/">Read More</a>]</p>

Here is the abstract: The modern API toolbox includes a variety of standards and methodologies, which centers around REST, but also includes Hypermedia, GraphQL, real time streaming, event-driven architecture , and gRPC. API design has pushed beyond just basic access to data, and also can be about querying complex data structures, providing experience rich APIs, real-time data streams with Kafka and other standards, as well as also leveraging the latest algorithms and providing access to machine learning models. The biggest mistake any company, organization, or government agency can do is limit their API toolbox to be just about REST. Learn about a robust and modern API toolbox from the API Evangelist, Kin Lane. Diverse Toolbox After eight years of evangelizing APIs, when I participate in many API conversations, some people still assume I’m exclusively talking about REST as the API Evangelist–when in reality I am simply talking about APIs that leverage the web. Sure, REST is a dominant design pattern I shine a light on, and has enjoyed a significant amount of the spotlight over the last decade, but in reality on the ground at companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies of all shapes and sizes, I find a much more robust API toolbox is required to get the job done. REST is just one tool in my robust and diverse toolbox, and I wanted to share with you what I am using in 2018. The toolbox I’m referring tool isn’t just about what is needed to equip an API architect to build out the perfect vision of the future. This is a toolbox that is equipped to get us from present day into the future, acknowledging all of the technical debt that exists within most organizations which many are looking to evolve as part of their larger digital transformation.

Here is the abstract: Understanding the PSD2 regulations unfolding for the banking industry is a daunting challenge for banks, aggregators, and regulators, let alone when you are an average user, journalist, or analyst trying to make sense of things. As the API Evangelist I have used a common approach to mapping out transit systems using the universally recognized subway map introduced by Harry Beck in London in the early 20th century. I’m taking this mapping technique and applying it to the PSD2 specification, helping provide a visual, and interactive way to navigating this new regulatory world unfolding in Europe. Join me for an exploration of API regulations in the banking industry, and how we can use a subway and transit map to help us quickly understand the complexities of PSD2, and learn what takes to get up and running with this new definition for the API economy. Using Transit As API Analogy I’ve been fascinated with transit systems and subway maps for most of my adult life. Recently I’ve begin thinking about the parallels between complex municipal transit systems, and complex API infrastructure. Beginning in 2015, I started working to see if I could apply the concept of a subway map to the world of APIs, not just as a visualization of complex API systems, but as a working interface to discover, learn about, and even govern hundreds, or even thousands of APIs working in concert. While very much a physical world thing, transit systems still share many common elements with API infrastructure, spanning multiple disparate systems, operated by disparate authorities, possessing legacy as well as modern infrastructure, and are used by many people for work and in their personal lives. While the transit system isn’t a perfect analogy for modern API infrastructure, there is enough there to keep me working to find a way to apply the concept, and specifically the transit map to...[<a href="/2018/02/03/a-regulatory-subway-map-for-psd2/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>26 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve been working on two talks for API Days in Paris next week. These talks are at two opposite ends of the API spectrum for me. The first one, API Is Not Just REST, is rooted in the technology of APIs, but then touches lightly on the business and politics of APIs. The second one, a regulatory subway map for PSD2, is all about the politics of APIs, but then touches lightly on the business and technology of APIs. I have the outlines for both talks done, and I’m working on the narrative and slides for each, along the way I’m really caught by how different each end of the spectrum are, and require me to use a different part of my brain–something I think really defines the yin and yang of APIs. When I’m down at the protocol level of APIs, thinking about the details of HTTP, TCP, and the nuance of how headers are used, and the messages we pass back and forth, the politics of APIs do not matter to me. My developer and architect brain is absorbed with the technical details, and the human or political consequences of my decisions really do not matter all that much. As long as things are technically correct, and my responses and requests are doing what is expected, I am good. It is easy for me to be railroaded within this technical silo, and I wouldn’t ever need to be concerned for the business and politics of it all, if my work as API Evangelist didn’t force me out of my comfort zone. Inversely, when I’m thinking about the politics of how this all works, and the intention and impact of regulatory guidance like PSD2 in Europe, the technical details of HTTP, headers, and what messages I’m using feel less important. Sure, they still matter to what I’m trying to do, but the strictness in which I define my protocols, headers, data formats, schema, and...[<a href="/2018/01/26/shifting-gears-between-the-technology-and-politics-of-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>24 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m signing up for a large number of new APIs lately as part of a project I am working on. It is pretty normal for me to sign up for a couple new APIs a week, or 10-20 within a month, but right now I’m signing up for hundreds, setting up an application and getting keys for each service. I’ll share more about what I’m working on in future stories, but I wanted to talk more about the on-boarding practices of some of these APIs. It is pretty clear from the on-boarding processes that I don’t rank very high in some of these API provider’s sales funnels, making me not deserving of self-service access, or even a sales call–which is a separate topic I will talk about in a future post. I’ve registered with a number of high value API providers who have more of an enterprise focus, but also have a seemingly self-service, public API available. After signing up for access, it becomes very clear that APIs are anything but self-service, and there is a sales funnel in play, and I’ve been ranked, tagged, and identified where I am in this sales funnel, and what value I bring as a potential small business–which is not much by usual measurements. I’m pretty well versed in how company’s set up their sales strategy, and have seen many companies think it is a good idea to translate these practies to their API operations. Only targeting the high value customers, and not really giving a shit about the rest of them. It just isn’t worth the resources to go after them, they don’t have the spending capacity of customers you want in your funnel. I get it. You are right. I don’t have a lot of money to buy your services, and will not become a high value customers. However, I have many readers who are high value customers, and trust my opinion about which services are worthy...[<a href="/2018/01/24/where-am-i-in-the-sales-funnel-for-your-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>24 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’ve been thinking about the potential for measuring value exchange at the API management level a lot more lately, and while I’m working on a project to profile banks that are needing to comply with the PSD2 regulations in Europe, I’m thinking about the missed opportunities for the API providers I’m using to fuel my research to leverage the value I’m generating. I’m using a variety of data enrichment APIs for helping add to the contact data, corporate profiles, images, documents, patents, and other valuable data to what I’m doing as part of my wider research into the API space. While these APIs have valuable services that I am paying for, all of the APIs are just using one HTTP verb–GET. On a regular basis I come across incorrect, or incomplete data, and as part of my work I dive in and correct the data, and continue to connect the dots. I often find better copies of logos, add in relevant business profile data, and I always provide very detailed information regarding a company’s API–which I find to be some of the most telling aspects of what a company does, or doesn’t do. I’m thankful for the services that the 3rd party APIs I utilize, but I think they are missing out on a pretty big opportunity for trusted partners like me to be able to POST or PUT the data I am gathering back to their systems. I would love to be able to POST and PUT back information to the APIs I am GETting my data from, and receive credits to my API bill for these contributions. It would benefit API providers by helping ensure the data they are providing is complete and acurate, and it would benefit me by helping me keep my API bills as low as possible. I understand that it would some work on the provider side to ensure I’m a trusted partner, and being able to verify the...[<a href="/2018/01/24/i-want-to-be-able-to-post-and-put-and-receive-credits-on-my-api-bill/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>24 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>One aspect of my partnership with Streamdata.io is about helping define what it is that Streamdata.io does–internally, and externally. When I use any API technology I always immerse myself in what it does, and understand every detail regarding the value it delivers, and I work to tell stories about this. This process helps me refine not just how I talk about the products and services, but also helps influence the road map for what the products and services deliver. As I get intimate with what Streamdata.io delivers, I’m beginning to push forward how I talk about the company. The first thoughts you have when you hear the name Streamdata.io, and learn about how you can proxy any existing JSON API, and begin delivering responses via Server-Sent Events (SSE) and JSON Patch, are all about streaming and real time. While streaming of data from existing APIs is the dominant feature of the service, I’m increasingly finding that the conversations I’m having with clients, and would be clients are more about efficiencies, caching, and streamlining how companies are delivering data. Many API providers I talk to tell me they don’t need real time streaming, but at the same time they have rate limits in place to keep their consumers from polling their APIs too much, increasing friction in API consumption, and not at all about streamlining it. These experiences are forcing me to shift how I open up conversations with API providers. Making real time and streaming secondary to streamlining how API providers are delivering data to their consumers. Real time streaming using Server-Sent Events (SSE) isn’t always about delivering financial and other data in real time. It is about delivering data using APIs efficiently, making sure only what what has been updated and needed is delivered when it is needed. The right time. This is why you’ll see me increasingly adding (line) to the Stream(line)data.io name, helping focus on the fact that we are helping streamline...[<a href="/2018/01/24/helping-define-streamlinedata-io-as-more-than-just-real-time-streaming/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>As part of my continued effort to break down the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) in Europe, and develop my awareness of how the regulations are intended, as well as the reality on the ground within the industry, I am working to map out all of the players involved. This post is about understanding the role of the European Banking Authority (EBA), and clearly understanding when and where they come into the conversation. First, what is the European Banking Authority (EBA)? They are the regulatory agency for the European Union, who is in charge of conducting stress tests on European banks and increasing transparency in the European financial system and identifying weaknesses in banks’ capital structures. When it comes to PSD2, their role is to: develop a publicly accessible central register of authorised payment institutions, which shall be kept up to date by the national authorities assist in resolving disputes between national authorities develop regulatory technical standards on strong customer authentication and secure communication channels with which all payment service providers must comply develop cooperation and information exchange between supervisory authorities The catalyst for this post was because I was looking for the “central register of authorized payment institutions”, and could not find it. Something that will be critical to this effort working, and evolving. I’m also on the hunt for more details regarding how they will be addressing authentication for all 3rd party API access, which will also be something that makes or breaks this effort. And, of course, as the API Evangelist I’m looking to help anyone in the position of helping “develop cooperation and information exchange”–it is what I do. When it comes to PSD2, I have gotten to know the API definition (OpenAPI), and I am making my way through the actual set of laws, but I’m still working to understand who all the players are. I’ll keep profiling every type participant in the PSD2 theater that is unfolding across Europe...[<a href="/2018/01/23/the-role-of-european-banking-authority-eba-when-it-comes-to-psd2/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>
I’m immersed in studying the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) in Europe, which includes an API definition to help enable the interoperability they are looking to achieve as part of the regulation. I’m working to break down the directive into bit such chunks to help be digest, and understand exactly what it does. The PSD2 laws seeks to improve the existing EU rules for electronic payments (hence the 2), and takes into account emerging approaches to payment services, such as Internet and mobile payments, with APIs at the hear.

The directive sets out rules concerning:


  strict security requirements for electronic payments and the protection of consumers’ financial data, guaranteeing safe authentication and reducing the risk of fraud
  the transparency of conditions and information requirements for payment services
  the rights and obligations of users and providers of payment services


Additionally, “the directive is complemented by Regulation (EU) 2015/751 which puts a cap on interchange fees charged between banks for card-based transactions. This is expected to drive down the costs for merchants in accepting consumer debit and credit cards.” Which can be one of the most frustrating aspects of banking today, where you have no expectations regarding the fees you can be charged around every turn, as you are just trying to make ends meet.

You will be seeing a lot more posts about PSD2 as I work to absorb the regulations, and the technical guidance set forth regarding banking APIs. I’m playing around with the OpenAPI definition for PSD2, and crafting a version of my API Transit subway map to represent the technical guidance present. I’m also working to understand the business, and political aspects of PSD2, which involves me breaking down the directive into this small, digestible stories, here on API Evangelist.

			<p><em>19 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>I am working to understand the value that Streamdata.io brings to the table, and one of the tools I am developing is a set of APIs to help me measure the difference in data received for normal API calls versus when they are proxied with Streamdata.io using Server-Sent Events (SSE) and JSON Patch. Creating an API to poll any 3rd party API I plug in is pretty easy and straightforward, but setting up a server setup to operate long running Server-Sent Events (SSE), managing for failure and keeping an eye on the results takes a little more consideration. Doing it browser side is easy, but server side removes the human aspect of the equation, which starts and stops the process. This post is just meant to just outline what I’m looking to build, and act as a set of project requirements for what I’m going to develop–it isn’t a guide to building it. This is just my way of working through my projects, while also getting content published on the blog ;-). I just need to work out the details of what I will need to run many different Server-Sent Events (SSE) jobs for long periods of time, or even continuously, and make sure nothing breaks, or at least minimize the breakages. Half of my project will be polling hundreds of APIs, while the other half of it will be proxy those same APIs, and making sure I’m receiving those updates continuously. I will need some basic APIs to operate each event stream I want to operate: Register - Register a new API URL I wish to run ongoing stream on. Start - Kick off a new stream for any single API I’m tracking on. Stop - Stop a stream from running for any single API I have streaming. Any API I deem worthy, and have successfully proxied with Streamdata.io will be registered, and operating as a long running background scripts via AWS EC2 instances...[<a href="/2018/01/19/developing-a-microservice-to-orchestrate-long-running-background-serversent/">Read More</a>]</p>

These vendor extensions show up in the OpenAPI you export for any API, and reflect how AWS has extended the OpenAPI specification, making sure it does what they need it to do as part of AWS API Gateway operations. AWS has 20 separate OpenAPI vendor extensions as part of the OpenAPI specification for any API you manage using their gateway solution: x-amazon-apigateway-any-method - Specifies the Swagger Operation Object for the API Gateway catch-all ANY method in a Swagger Path Item Object. This object can exist alongside other Operation objects and will catch any HTTP method that was not explicitly declared. x-amazon-apigateway-api-key-source - Specify the source to receive an API key to throttle API methods that require a key. This API-level property is a String type. x-amazon-apigateway-authorizer - Defines a custom authorizer to be applied for authorization of method invocations in API Gateway. This object is an extended property of the Swagger Security Definitions object. x-amazon-apigateway-authtype - Specify an optional customer-defined information describing a custom authorizer. It is used for API Gateway API import and export without functional impact. x-amazon-apigateway-binary-media-types - Specifies the list of binary media types to be supported by API Gateway, such as application/octet-stream, image/jpeg, etc. This extension is a JSON Array. x-amazon-apigateway-documentation - Defines the documentation parts to be imported into API Gateway. This object is a JSON object containing an array of the DocumentationPart instances. x-amazon-apigateway-gateway-responses - Defines the gateway responses for an API as a string-to-GatewayResponse map of key-value pairs. x-amazon-apigateway-gateway-responses.gatewayResponse - Defines a gateway response of a given response type, including the status code, any applicable response parameters, or response templates. x-amazon-apigateway-gateway-responses.responseParameters - Defines a string-to-string map of key-value pairs to generate gateway response parameters from the incoming request parameters or using literal strings. x-amazon-apigateway-gateway-responses.responseTemplates -...[<a href="/2018/01/19/aws-api-gateway-openapi-vendor-extensions/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>19 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>My friend Irakli Nadareishvili, has published a new health check response format for HTTP APIs that I wanted to make sure was documented as part of my research. The way I do this is write a blog post, forever sealing this work in time, and adding it to the public record that is my API Evangelist brain. Since I use my blog as a reference when writing white papers, guides, blueprints, policies, and other aspects of my work, I need as many references to usable standards like this. I am going to just share the introduction from Irakli’s draft, as it says it all: The vast majority of modern APIs driving data to web and mobile applications use HTTP [RFC7230] as a transport protocol. The health and uptime of these APIs determine availability of the applications themselves. In distributed systems built with a number of APIs, understanding the health status of the APIs and making corresponding decisions, for failover or circuit-breaking, are essential for providing highly available solutions. There exists a wide variety of operational software that relies on the ability to read health check response of APIs. There is currently no standard for the health check output response, however, so most applications either rely on the basic level of information included in HTTP status codes [RFC7231] or use task-specific formats. Usage of task-specific or application-specific formats creates significant challenges, disallowing any meaningful interoperability across different implementations and between different tooling. Standardizing a format for health checks can provide any of a number of benefits, including: Flexible deployment - since operational tooling and API clients can rely on rich, uniform format, they can be safely combined and substituted as needed. Evolvability - new APIs, conforming to the standard, can safely be introduced in any environment and ecosystem that also conforms to the same standard, without costly coordination and testing requirements. This document defines a “health check” format using the JSON format [RFC7159] for APIs to...[<a href="/2018/01/19/a-health-check-response-format-for-http-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>18 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>I am a big fan API providers taking ownership of their OpenAPI definition, which enables API consumers to download a complete OpenAPI then import into any client tooling like Postman, using it to generate client SDKs, and getting up to speed regarding the surface area of an API. This is why I like to showcase API providers I come across who do this well, and occasionally shame API providers who don’t do it, and demonstrate to their consumers that they don’t really understand what OpenAPI definitions are all about. This week I am showcasing an API provider who does it well. I was on the hunt for an OpenAPI of the Docker Engine API, for use in a project I am consulting on, and was please to find that they have a button to download the OpenAPI for each version of the Docker Engine API right at the top of the page. Making it dead simple for me, as an API consumer, to get up and running with the Docker API in my tooling. OpenAPI is about much more than just the API documentation, and something that should be a first class companion to ALL API documentation for EVERY API provider out there–whether or not you are a devout OpenAPI (fka Swgger) believer. The Docker API team just saved me a significant amount of time in tracking down another OpenAPI, which most likely would be incomplete. Let alone the amount of work that would be required to hand-craft one for my project. I was able to take the existing OpenAPI and publish to the team Github Wiki for a project I’m advising on. The team will be able to use the OpenAPI to import into their Postman Client and begin to learn about the Docker API, which will be used to orchestrate the containers they are using to operate their own microservices. A subset of this team will also be crafting some APIs that proxy...[<a href="/2018/01/18/docker-engine-api-has-openapi-download-at-top-of-their-api-docs/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I was integrating with the Clearbit API, doing some enrichment of the API providers I track on, and I found their API stack pretty interesting. I’m just using the enrichment API, which allows me to pass it a URL, and it gives me back a bunch of intelligence on the organization behind. I’ve added a bookmarklet to my browser, which allows me to push it, and the enriched data goes directly into my CRM system. Delivering what it the title says it does–enrichment. Next up, I’m going to be using the Clearbit Discovery API to find some potentially new companies who are doing APIs in specific industries. As I head over the to the docs for the API, I notice the other three APIs, and I feel like they reflect the five stages of transition to the data intelligence dark side. Enrichment API - The Enrichment API lets you look up person and company data based on an email or domain. For example, you could retrieve a person’s name, location and social handles from an email. Or you could lookup a company’s location, headcount or logo based on their domain name. Discovery API - The Discovery API lets you search for companies via specific criteria. For example, you could search for all companies with a specific funding, that use a certain technology, or that are similar to your existing customers. Prospector API - The Prospector API lets you fetch contacts and emails associated with a company, employment role, seniority, and job title. Risk API - The Risk API takes an email and IP and calculates an associated risk score. This is especially useful for figuring out whether incoming signups to your service are spam or legitimate, or whether a payment has a high chargeback risk. Reveal API - Reveal API takes an IP address, and returns the company associated with that IP.

			<p>I am working to evolve an algorithm for Streamdata.io that helps measure the benefits of their streaming service. There are a couple layers to what they offer as a company, but as I dive into this algorithm, there are also multiple dimensions to what we all perceive as real time, and adding more complexity to the discussion, it is something that can significantly shift from industry to industry. The Streamdata.io team was working to productize this algorithm for quantifying the value their service delivers, but I wanted to take some time to break it down, lay it out on the workbench and think about it before they moved to far down this path. Ok. To help me get my brain going, I wanted to work my way through the dictionary sites, exploring what is real time? Real time often seems to describe a human rather than a machine sense of time. It is about communicating, showing, or presenting something at the time it actually happens, where there is no notable delay between the action and its effect or consequence. All of this is relative to the human receiving the real time event, as well as defining exactly when something truly happens / happened. Real time in banking is different than real time in stock trading, and will be different than media. All requiring their own perception of what is real time, and what the effects, consequences, and perceptions are. When it comes to the delivery or streaming of real time events, it isn’t just about the delivering of the event, message, or transaction. It is about doing it efficiently. The value of real time gets ruined pretty quickly when you have to wade through too much information, or you are given too many updates of events, messages, and transactions that are not relevant. Adding an efficient element to the concept of what is real time.

			<p>This is a series of stories I’m doing as part of my API Transit work, trying to map out a simple journey that some of my clients can take to rethink some of the basics of their API strategy. I’m using a subway map visual, and experience to help map out the journey, which I’m calling API transit–leveraging the verb form of transit, to describe what every API should go through. This is a simple one. All APIs will eventually need to be deprecated. This is how you avoid legacy systems that have been up for over decades. Make sure the life span of each service is discussed as part of its conception, and put some details out about the expected timeline for its existence. Even if this becomes an unknown, at least you thought about it, and hopefully discussed it with others. Here are just a few of the common building blocks I’m seeing with API operations that respect their users enough to plan for API deprecation: Releases - Have a set release schedule, and think about what will be deprecated along with each release, allowing for future planning with push. Schedule - Have a deprecation schedule set for each API. You can always extend, or keep versions of your API beyond the date, but at least set a minimum schedule. Communication - Make sure you have a communication strategy around deprecations. Post to the blog, Tweet out notices, and send emails. The Sunset HTTP Header - This specification defines the Sunset HTTP response header field, which indicates that a URI is likely to become unresponsive at a specified point in the future. Another valuable concept this process will introduce is the possibility that APIs can be ephemeral and maybe only exist for days, weeks, or months. With CI/CD cycles allowing for daily, weekly, and monthly code pushes, there is no reason that APIs can evolve rapidly, and deprecate just as fast. Make sure...[<a href="/2018/01/17/api-transit-basics-deprecation/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>The concept of API management has been around for a decade now, and is something that is now part of the fabric of the cloud with services like AWS API Gateway. API management is about requiring all consumers of any API resource to sign up for any API access, obtain a set of keys that identify who they are, and pass these keys in with each API call they make from any application. Since every API call is logged, and every API call possesses these keys, it opens up the ability to understand exactly how your APIs are being used through reporting and analytics packages which come with all modern API management available today. This is the fundamentals of API management, allowing us to understand who is accessing our digital resources, and how they are putting them to use–in real time. The security of API management comes in with this balance of opening up access, being aware of who is accessing what, and being able to throttle or shut down the access of bad actors–more than it is ever about authentication, and requiring keys for all API calls. If you want access to any digital resources from a company, organization, institution, or government agency in a machine readable format, for use in any other web, mobile, or device application–you use the API. This allows ALL digital assets to be made available internally, to trusted partners, and even to the public, while still maintaining control over who has access to what, and what types of applications they are able to use them in. APIs introduce more control over our digital resources, not less–which is a persistent myth when it comes to web APIs. API management allows us to limit who has access to which APIs by putting each API into one or many “plans”. The concept of software as a service (SaaS) has dominated this discussion around plan access, establishing tiers of API access such as...[<a href="/2018/01/17/api-management-and-the-measurement-of-value-exchanged/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>As I look through the developer, data, and API portals of transit authorities in cities around the United States, one thing is clear–they are all underfunded, understaffed, and not a priority. This is something that will have to change if transit authorities are expected to survive, let alone thrive in a digital world. I’m working on a series of white papers as part of my partnership with Streamdata.io, on transit data, and the monetization of public data. I’ll be writing more on this subject as part of this work, but I needed to start working through my ideas, and begin crafting my narrative around how transit authorities can generate much needed revenue and compete in this digital world. I know that many transit authorities often see data as a byproduct, and something that is occasionally useful, and that their main objective is to keep the trains running. However, every tech company, and developer out there understands the value of the data being generated by the transit schedule, the trains, and most importantly the ridership. The Googles, Ubers, and data brokers are mining this data, enriching their big data warehouses, and actively working to generate revenue from transit authorities most valuable assets–their riders. Ticket sales, and people riding the trains seems like the direct value generation, but in the era of big data, where those people are going, what they are doing, reading, thinking, and who they are doing it with is equally or more valuable than the price of the ticket to ride. Most of the transit APIs I’m using require you to sign up for a key, so there is some sort of API management in place. However, there are still huge volumes of feeds and downloads that are not being managed, and there is no evidence that there is any sort of analysis, reporting, or other intelligence being gathered from API consumption. Demonstrating that API management is more about rate limiting, and keeping...[<a href="/2018/01/16/transit-authorities-need-to-understand-that-api-management-means-more-control/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m working through the different ways that transit authorities can generate more revenue from their data using APIs as part of my work with Streamdata.io. Making data streaming and truly more real time is the obvious goal of this research, but Streamdata.io is invested in transit authorities take more control over their data resources, and use APIs to generate revenue at a time when they need all the revenue they can possible get their hands on. One overlap in the projects I’m working on with Streamdata.io is where transit data intersects with machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I’m not sure what transit authorities are doing with their historical data, but I know that it isn’t available via their APIs, and developer portals. I’m guessing they see historical data about schedules, vehicles, riderships, and other data points as a burden, and once they’ve generated the reports they need, don’t do anything else with it. This historical data is a goldmine of information when it comes to training machine learning models, which could then in turn be better used to understand ridership, make predictions, understand maintenance, scheduling, and other aspects of transit operations–let alone commerce, real estate, and other demographic data. There is a dizzying amount of investment going into machine learning and artificial intelligence right now, and is something that could be routed to transit authorities to help boost revenue. If all historical data on transit operations was digitized and available via APIs, then metered using modern API management approaches, it could be an entirely new revenue opportunity for transit authorities. Transit systems are the heartbeat of the cities they operate within, and historical data is the record of everything that occurs, which can be used to develop machine learning models for the transit industry, as well as real estate, commerce, and other sectors that transit systems feed into on a daily basis, and have for years. I do not know what data transit authorities possess....[<a href="/2018/01/16/the-value-of-historical-transit-data-when-it-comes-to-machine-learning/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m spending time immersed in the world of transit data and APIs lately, and found a simple, yet useful approach to helping onboard developers over at the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) API. When you you click on their products page (not sure why they use this name), you get a guest API key which allows you try out the API, and kick the tires. Of course, you can’t use the key in production applications, as it is rate limited and can change at any time, but the concept is simple, and provides an example which other API providers might want to consider. In my days as the API Evangelist I’ve seen API providers do this in a variety of ways, by providing sample API URLs complete with an API key, and by embedding a key in the OpenAPI definition, so that the interactive documentation picks up the key and will allow developers to make live, interactive API calls–to name a few. No matter what your approach, providing a guest key for users to play around without signing up makes a lot of sense. Of course, you want to rotate this key regularly, or at least be monitoring it to see what IP addresses it is being called from, and maybe understand how its being used–you never know, it might reveal some interesting use cases. Whatever your approach, get out of the way of your consumers. Don’t expect that everyone is going to want to sign up for an account so that they can learn about what your API does. Not everyone is interested in handing over their email address, and other information just so they can test drive. If you have API management in place (which you should), it really doesn’t take much to generate test users, applications, and keys, monitor them, and rotate them on a regular basis. I recommend using them like you would marketing tags, and strategically place them into...[<a href="/2018/01/16/providing-a-guest-api-key/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>I am working with a number of different groups who are using developer portals in some very different ways once they have moved beyond the concept that API developer portals are just for use in the public domain. With the introduction of the static site shift in the CMS landscape, and the introduction of Jekyll and Github Pages as part of the Github project workflow, the concept of the API developer portal is beginning to mean a lot of different things, depending on what the project objective is. An API portal is becoming something that can reflect a specific project, or group, and isn’t something that always has a public URL. Here are just a few of the ways in which I’m seeing portals being wielded as part of API operations. Individual Portals - Considering how developers and business users can be leverage portals to push forward conversations around the APIs they own and are moving forward. Team Portals - Thinking about how different groups and teams can have their own portals which aggregate APIs and other portals from across their project. Partner Portals - Leveraging a single, or even partner specific portals that are public or private for engaging in API projects with trusted partners. Public Portal - Begin the process of establishing a single Mutual of Omaha developer portal to provide a single point of entry for all public API efforts across the organization. Pipeline Integration - How can BitBucket be leverage for deploying of individual, team, partner, and even the public portal, making portals another aspect of the continuous deployment pipeline. One of the most interesting shifts that I am seeing is the deployment of portals as part of continuous deployment and integration pipelines. Since you can host a portal on Github, why not be deploying it, managing and evolving it as its own pipeline, or as part of individual projects, and partner integrations. This is something that static CMSs have have...[<a href="/2018/01/16/moving-beyond-a-single-api-developer-portal/">Read More</a>]</p>

I’m using a subway map visual, and experience to help map out the journey, which I’m calling API transit–leveraging the verb form of transit, to describe what every API should go through. Think of support as a reactive area, while training will be the proactive area of the API life cycle. Ensuring there is a wealth of up to date material for API developers and consumers across all stops along the API life cycle. Investing in internal, and partner capacity when it comes to the fundamentals of APIs, as well as the finer details of each stop along the API life cycle, and CI/CD pipelines will pay off big time down the road. Every API should be included in training materials, workshops, and potentially part of conference talks given my product owners. If your API delivers value within your organization, to partners, and 3r party developers you should be training folks on putting this value to use. Here are some of the training areas I’m seeing emerge within successful API operations: Workshops - Conduct more of the workshops that I conducted with external consultants like me, as well as make sure they are conducted internally by each group. The first day of the our workshop was a great example of this in action. Curriculum - Establish common approaches to designing, developing, and evolving curriculum for teaching about the API lifecycle, as well as using each individual API. Provide forkable templates that developers can easily put to work as part of their work, and make support materials a pipeline asset that gets deployed along with documentation, and other assets. Conferences - Make sure you are sending team members to the latest conferences. In my conversations during the...[<a href="/2018/01/16/api-transit-basics-training/">Read More</a>]</p>

Beyond communication, make sure there is adequate support across API teams, and the services, tooling, and processes involved with operations. If an API goes unsupported, it might as well not exist at all, making standardized, comprehensive support practices essential. Every API should have an owner, with a contact information published as part of all API definitions. Ideally, every API owner has a backup point of contact to go to if someone should leave a company, or is out sick. Similar to the communications stop along this journey, there a handful of common support building blocks you see present within the leading API pioneers portals. These are the four I recommend baking in by default to all of your API portals, and anywhere API discovery and documentation exists. Email - Make sure there is support available via email channels, with a responsive individual on the other end–with accountability. Tickets - Consider a ticketing system for submitting and supporting requests around API operations. Dedicated - Identify one, or many individuals who can act as internal, partner, and public support when it makes sense. Office Hours - Consider one time a week where there is a human being available in person, or online to answer direct question. Every single API should have a support element present as part of its operations. Each API definition allows for the inclusion of responsible point of contact via email, and other channels–make use of it.

			<p><em>15 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>Everyone wants their API to be used. We all suffer from “if we build it, they will come” syndrome in the world of APIs. If we craft a simple, useful API, developers will flock to it and integrate it into their applications. However, if you operate an API, you know that getting the attention of developers, and standing out amongst the growing number of APIs is easier said than done. Even if your API truly does bring the value you envision to the table, getting people to discover this value, and invest the time into integrating it into the platforms, products, and services takes a significant amount of work–requiring that you remove all possible obstacles and friction from any possible integration opportunity. One way we can remove obstacles for possible integrations is by allowing for ALL types of applications–even other APIs. If you think about it, APIs are just another type of application, and one that many API providers I’ve talked with either haven’t thought about at all, or haven’t thought about very deeply and restrict this use case, as they see it as directly competing with their interests. Why would you want to prevent someone from reselling your API, if it brings you traffic, sales, and the other value your API brings to your company, organization, institution, or government agency? If a potential API consumer has an audience, and wants to private label your API, how does that hurt your business? If you have proper API management in place, and have a partner agreement in place with them, how is it different than any other application? I’ve been profiling companies as part of my partnership with Streamdata.io, looking for opportunities to deliver real time streaming APIs on top of existing web APIs. Ideally, API providers become a Streamdata.io customer, but we are also looking to enable other businesses to step up and resell existing APIs as a streaming version.

Hopefully you already have your own security practices in place, with the ability to scan for vulnerabilities, and understand where security problems might exist. If you do, I’m guessing you probably already have procedures and protocols around reporting, and handling security problems across teams. Ideally, your API security practices are more about prevention than they are about responding to a crisis, but your overall strategy should have plans in place for addressing both ends of the spectrum. Unfortunately in the wider API space, much of the conversation around API security has been slowed by many people feeling like their API management solutions were doing everything that is needed. Luckily, in 2017 we began to see this thaw a bit and some API security focused solutions began to appear on the market, as well as some existing players began tuning into to address the specific concerns of API security, beyond the desktop, web, and other common areas of concern.

Moving further towards the human side of this API transit journey, I’d like to focus on one of the areas that I see cause the failure and stagnation of many API operations–basic communications. A lack of communication, and one way communication are the most common contributors to APIs not reaching their intended audience, and establishing much needed feedback loops that contribute to the API road map. This portion of the journey is not rocket science, it just take stepping back from the tech for a moment and thinking about the humans involved. When you look at Twitter, Twilio, Slack, Amazon, SalesForce, and the other leading API pioneers you see a handful of communication building blocks present across all of them. These are just a few of the communication elements that should be present in both internal, as well as external or publicly available API operations. Blogs - Make blogs a default part of ALL portals, whether partner, public, or internal. They don’t have to be grand storytelling vehicles, but can be used as part of communicating around updates within teams, groups, and for projects. Twitter - Not required for internally focused APIs, but definitely essential if you are running a publicly available API. Github - Github enables all types of communication around repos, issues, wikis, and other aspects of managing code, definitions, and content on the social coding platform.

			<p><em>15 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>One of aspects of a project I’ve been assisting with recently involves helping define, implement, and organize the usage of OpenAPI vendor extensions across a distributed microservice development team. When I first began advising this group, I introduced them to the concept of extending the OpenAPI definition using x-extension format, expanding the teams approach to how they use the OpenAPI specification. They hadn’t heard that you can extend OpenAPI beyond what the specification brings to the table, allowing them to make it deliver exactly what they needed. Within this project each microservice exists in its own Github repository, with an OpenAPI definition available in the root, defining the surface area of the API. At the organizational level, I have a script that will loop through all Github repos, spider each OpenAPI looking for any x-extensions, and then it aggregates them into a single master list of OpenAPI vendor extensions that are used across all APIs. I then take the list, and add descriptions to each verified extension, and when I come across ones I haven’t seen before I reach out to microservice owners to understand what the vendor extension is used for, and ensure it is in alignment with overall API governance for the project. I am looking to encourage API designers, developers, and architects to extend OpenAPI. I am also looking to help them be responsible with this power, and make sure they are doing it for good reasons. I am also looking to organize, then educate across teams regarding how different groups are using OpenAPI vendor extensions, and incentivize the reuse and standardization of these extensions. I see vendor extensions as an area for potential innovation when it comes to defining what an API is capable of, as well as the relationship each microservice has with its supporting architecture. Acting for a relief valve for the often perceived constraints of the OpenAPI specification.

			<p>You hear me say it all the time–if you are selling services and tooling to the API sector, you should have an API. In support of this way of thinking I like to highlight the API service providers I work with who follow this philosophy, and today’s example is from (Postman](https://postman.com). If you aren’t familiar with Postman, I recommend getting acquainted. It is an indispensable tool for integrating, consuming, and collaborating around the APIs you depend on, and are developing. Postman is essential to working with APIs in 2018, no matter whether you are developing them, or integrating with 3rd party APIs. Further amplifying the usefulness of Postman as a client tool, the Postman API reflects the heart of what Postman does as not just a client, but a complete life cycle tool. The Postman API provides five separate APIs, allowing you orchestration your API integration, consumption, and collaboration environment. Collections - The /collections endpoint returns a list of all collections that are accessible by you. The list includes your own collections and the collections that you have subscribed to. Environments - The /environments endpoint returns a list of all environments that belong to you. The response contains an array of environments’ information containing the name, id, owner and uid of each environment. Mocks - This endpoint fetches all the mocks that you have created. Monitors - The /monitors endpoint returns a list of all monitors that are accessible by you. The response contains an array of monitors information containing the name, id, owner and uid of each monitor. User - The /me endpoint allows you to fetch relevant information pertaining to the API Key being used. The user, collections, and environments APIs reflect the heart of the Postman API client, where mocks and monitors reflects its move to be a full API life cycle solution.

			<p><em>12 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>I’m providing API guidance on a project being delivered to a government agency, as part of my Skylight partnership, and found myself spending more time looking around the AWS compliance department. You can find details on certifications, regulations, laws, and frameworks ranging from HIPPA and FERPA to FedRAMP, so that it can be used by federal government agencies in the United States, and other countries. You can find a list of services that are in scope, and track on their progress when it comes to compliance across this complex web of compliance rules. I’ve been primarily tracking on the progress of the AWS API Gateway which is currently in progress when it comes to FedRAMP compliance. When it comes to regulatory compliance, AWS has a significant leg up on its competitors, Google and Microsoft. Both of these cloud platforms have existing regulatory efforts, but they aren’t as organized, or as far along as AWS’s approach to delivering in this area. Delivering cloud solutions that are compliant gives AWS a pretty significant advantage when it comes to first impressions with government agencies, and enterprise organizations operating within heavily regulated industries. Once this impression is made, and these groups have gotten a taste of AWS, and migrated systems, and data to their cloud, it will be hard to change their behavior. As this whole Internet thing grows up, regulatory compliance is unavoidable. Many companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies we are selling to are already needing to deliver when it comes to compliance, but even for the shiny new starts breaking new ground, at some point you will have to mature and deliver within regulatory constraints. Making AWS a pretty appealing place to be publishing databases, servers, and I’m hoping pretty soon, APIs using AWS API Gateway. If you are on the AWS API Gateway team, I’d love to get an update on the status, as I have a big government project I’d love to deploy using...[<a href="/2018/01/12/aws-has-head-start-helping-navigate-regulatory-compliance-in-the-cloud/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>12 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>Software Development Kits (SDKs), and code libraries in a variety of programming languages have always been a hallmark of API operations. Some API pundits feel that SDKs aren’t worth the effort to maintain, and keep in development alongside the rest of API operations, while others have done well delivering robust SDKs that span very valuable API stacks–consider the AWS JavaScript SDK as an example. Amidst this debate, SDKs continue to maintain their presence, and even have been evolving to support a more continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) approach to delivering APIs and the applications that depend on them. Supporting SDKs in a variety of programming languages can be difficult for some API providers. Luckily there is tooling available that help auto-generate SDKs from API definitions, helping make the SDK part of the conversation a little smoother. Of course, it depends on the scope and complexity of your APIs, but increasingly auto-generated SDKs and code as part of a CI/CD process is becoming the normal way of getting things done, whether you are just making them available to your API consumers, or you are actually doing the consuming yourself. Swagger Codegen - The leading open source effort for generating SDKs from OpenAPI. APIMATIC - The leading service for generating SDKs from OpenAPI, and including as part of existing CI/CD efforts. RESTUnited - The easiest way to generate SDKs (REST API libraries): PHP, Python, Ruby, ActionScript (Flash), C#, Android, Objective-C, Scala, Java Depending on your versioning and build processes, SDK generation can be done alongside all the other stops along this life cycle. When you iterate on an API, you simply auto-generate documentation, tests, SDKs, and other aspects of supporting your services. Not all providers I talk with are easily able to jump into the aspect of producing code, as their build processes aren’t as streamline, and some of their APIs are too large to expect auto-generated code to perform as expected. However, it is...[<a href="/2018/01/12/api-transit-basics-sdkst/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>12 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>Every API should be tested to ensure it delivers what is expected of it. All code being deployed should meet required unit and code tests, but increasingly API testing is adding another layer of assurance to existing build processes, even going so far as halting CI/CD workflows if tests fail. API testing is another area where API definitions are delivering, allowing tests to be built from existing artifacts, and allowing detailed assertions to be associated with tests to add to and evolve the existing definitions. API testing has grown over the last couple of years to include a variety of open source solutions, as well as cloud service providers. Most of the quality solutions allow you to import your OpenAPI, and automate the testing via APIs. Here are a few of the solutions I recommend considering as you think about how API testing can be introduced into your API operations. Runscope - An API testing service that uses OpenAPI for importing and exporting of API tests and assertions. Hippie-Swagger - An open source solution for testing your OpenAPI defined APIs. Spring Cloud Contract - Spring Cloud Contract is an umbrella project holding solutions that help users in successfully implementing the Consumer Driven Contracts approach. Postman Testing - With Postman you can write and run tests for each request using the JavaScript language. Frisby.js - Frisby is a REST API testing framework built on Node.js and Jasmine that makes testing API endpoints easy, fast, and fun. There are numerous ways to augment API testing on top of your existing testing strategy. More of these providers are integrating with Jenkins and other CI/CD solutions, allowing API testing to deeply integrate with existing pipelines. My recommendation is that the artifacts from these tests and assertions also live alongside OpenAPI and other artifacts and are used as part of the overall definition strategy, widening the meaning of “contract” to apply across all stops along the lifecycle–not just testing.

			<p>I’ve been diving into the world of transit data, and learning more about GTFS and GTFS Realtime, two of the leading specifications for providing access to static and real time transit data. I’ve been able to take the static GTFS data and quickly render as APIs, using the zipped up CSV files provided. Next on my list I wanted to be able to work with GTFS Realtime data, as this is where the data is that changes much more often, and ultimately is more valuable in applications and to consumers. Google has developed a nice suite of GTFS Realtime bindings in a variety of programming languages, including .NET, Java, JavaScript / Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Golang. I went with the PHP bindings, which interestingly enough is the only one in its own Github repository. I’m using it because I still feel that PHP has the best opportunity for adoption within municipal organizations–something that is beginning to change, but still holds true in my experience. The GTFS-realtime data is encoded and decoded using Protocol Buffers, which provides a compact binary representation designed for fast and efficient processing of the data. Even with the usage of Protocol Buffers, which is also used by gRPC via HTTP/2, all of the GFTS Realtime data feeds I am consuming are being delivered via regular HTTP/1.1. I’m doing all this work to be able to make GTFS Realtime feeds more accessible for use by Streamdata.io, as the Protocol Buffers isn’t something the service currently supports. To make the data accessible for delivery via Server-Sent Events (SSE), and for partial updates to be delivered via JSON Patch, I need the Protocol Buffer format to be reduced to a simpler JSON format–which will be my next weeks worth of work on this project. I was able to pretty quickly bind to the MTA subway GTFS Realtime feed here in NYC using the PHP bindings, and get at up to date “vehicle” and...[<a href="/2018/01/11/working-with-general-transit-feed-specificationgtfs-realtime-data/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format for providing access to transit data has dominated the landscape for most of the time I have been researching transit data and APIs over the last couple of weeks. A dominance led by Google and their Google Maps, who is the primary entity behind GTFS. However the tech team at Streamdata.io brought it to my attention the other day that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Bus Time API Supports Service Interface for Real Time Information (SIRI), another standard out of Europe. I think MTA’s introduction to Siri, and the story behind their decision tells a significant tale about how standards are viewed. According to the MTA, “SIRI (Service Interface for Real Time Information) is a standard covering a wide range of types of real-time information for public transportation. This standard has been adopted by the European standards-setting body CEN, and is not owned by any one vendor, public transportation agency or operator. It has been implemented in a growing number of different projects by vendors and agencies around Europe.” I feel like their thoughts about SIRI not being owned by any one vendor is an important thing to take note of. While GTFS is an open standard, it is clearly a Google-led effort, and I’d say their decision to use Protocol Buffers reflects the technology, business, and politics of Google’s vision for the transit sector. The MTA has evolved SIRI as part of their adoption, opting to deliver APIs as more of a RESTful interface as opposed to SOAP, and providing responses in JSON, which makes things much more accessible to a wider audience. While technologically sound decisions, I think using Protocol Buffers or even SOAP have political implications when you do not deeply consider your API consumers during the planning phases of your API. I feel like MTA has done this, and understands the need to lower the bar when it comes to the access of public...[<a href="/2018/01/11/the-metropolitan-transportation-authority-mta-bus-time-api-supports-service/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I wrote a piece previously about Consul not supporting Swagger documentation at this time, and the API provider and consumer impact of this decision. I’m going to continue picking on Consul with another API definition story, because they are forcing me to hand-craft my own OpenAPI. If I just had to learn about the API, and load the OpenAPI (fka Swagger) definition into my postman, publish to the repo for the project, and import into other tooling I’m using, I wouldn’t be so critical. However, since I’m having to take their static, and often incomplete documentation, and generate an OpenAPI for my project, I’m going to vent some about their API and schema design, and they short-sighted view of OpenAPI (cough, cough fka Swagger). I just finished an OpenAPI for the Consul ACLs API path, and currently working on one for the Agent API path. I have already distilled down their static documentation into something that I can easily parse and translate into OpenAPI, I just need to finish doing the manual work. It is something I normally do with a scrape script, but the difficulties in consistently parsing their docs, combined with the scope of the docs, made me go with hand-crafting after distilling down the documentation for easier handling. I am familiar with the entire surface area of the Consul API, and now I’m getting to it’s intimate details, which also includes it’s intimate lack of details. The first area I begin stumbling on is with the design of the Consul API. While it is a web or HTTP API, it isn’t following most of the basics of REST, which would significantly help things be a little more intuitive. Simple examples of this in action would be with the LAN Coordinates for a node path, which is a PUT with the following path /coordinate/update – making for verb redundancy in the HTTP Verb and path.

			<p>API documentation is the number one pain point for developers trying to understand what is going on with an API, as they work to get up and running consuming the resources they possess. From many discussions I’ve had with API providers it is also a pretty big pain point for many API developers when it comes to trying to keep up to date, and delivering value to consumers. Thankfully API documentation has been being driven by API definitions like OpenAPI for a while, helping keep things up date and in sync with changes going on behind the scenes. The challenge for many groups who are only doing OpenAPI to produce documentation, is that if the OpenAPI isn’t used across the API life cycle, it will often become forgotten, recreating that timeless challenge with API documentation. Thankfully in the last year or so I’m beginning to see more API documentation solutions emerge getting us beyond the Swagger UI age of docs. Don’t get me wrong, I’m thankful for what Swagger UI has done, but the I’m finding it to be very difficult to get people beyond the idea that OpenAPI (fka Swagger) isn’t the same thing as Swagger UI, and that the only reason you generate API definitions is to get documentation. There are a number of API documentation solutions to choose from in 2018, but Swagger UI still remains a viable choice for making sure your APIs are properly documented for your consumers. Swagger UI - Do not abandon Swagger UI, keep using it, but decouple it from existing code generation practices. Redoc - Another OpenAPI driven documentation solution. Read the Docs - Read the Docs hosts documentation, making it fully searchable and easy to find.

			<p><em>11 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>I broke this area of my research into a separate stops a couple years back, as I saw several new types of service providers emerging to provide a new type of web-based API client. These new tools allowed you to consume, collaborate, and put APIs to use without writing any code. I knew that this shift was going to be significant, even though it hasn’t played out as I expected, with most of the providers disappearing, or being acquired, and leaving just a handful of solutions that we see today. These new web API clients allow for authentication, and the ability to quickly copy and paste API urls, or the importing of API definitions to begin making requests, and seeing responses for targeted aPIs. These clients were born out of earlier API explorers and interactive API documentation, but have matured into standalone services that are doing interesting things to how we consume APIs. Here are the three web API clients I recommend you consider as part of your API life cycle. Postman - A desktop and web client for working with and collaborating in a team environment around APIs. PAW - Paw is a full-featured HTTP client that lets you test and describe the APIs you build or consume. It has a beautiful native macOS interface to compose requests, inspect server responses, generate client code and export API definitions. -RESTFddle - An easy-to-use platform to work with APIs. It simplifies everything from API exposure to API consumption. RESTFiddle is an Enterprise-grade API Management Platform for teams. It helps you to design, develop, test and release APIs. Using web API clients allows for APIs to be easily defined, mocked, collaborated around, and leveraged as part of an API definition driven life cycle. The approach to integration saves significant cycles by allowing APIs to be designed, developed, and integrated with before any code gets written. Plus, the team and collaboration features that many of them posses can...[<a href="/2018/01/11/api-life-cycle-basics-clients/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I was looking for an OpenAPI for the Consul API to use in a project I’m working on. I have a few tricks for finding OpenAPI out in the wild, which always starts with looking over at APIs.guru, then secondarily Githubbing it (are we to verb status yet?). From a search on Github I came across an issue on the Github repo for Hashicorp’s Consul, which asked for “improved API documentation”, a Hashicorp employee ultimately responded with “we just finished a revamp of the API docs and we don’t have plans to support Swagger at this time.”. Highlighting the continued misconception of what is “OpenAPI”, what it is used for, and how important it can be to not just providing an API, but also consuming it. First things first. Swagger is now OpenAPI (has been for a while), an API specification format that is in the Open API Initiative (OAI), which is part of the Linux Foundation. Swagger is proprietary tooling for building with the OpenAPI specification. It’s an unfortunate and confusing situation that arose out of the move to the Open API Initiative, but it is one we need to move beyond, so you will find me correcting folks more often on this subject. Next, let’s look at the consumer question, asking for “improved API documentation”. OpenAPI (fka Swagger) is much more than documentation. I understand this position as much of the value it delivers to the API consumer is often the things we associate with documentation delivering. It teaches us about the surface area of an API, detailing the authentication, request, and response structure. However, OpenAPI does this in a machine readable way that allows us to take the definition with us, load it up in other tooling like Postman, as well as use to autogenerate code, tests, monitors, and many other time saving elements when we are working to integrate with an API. Lesson for the API consumers here is that OpenAPI...[<a href="/2018/01/10/we-are-not-supporting-openapi-fka-swagger-as-we-already-published-our-docs/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I’ve been studying the overall Apache Stack a lot lately, with an emphasis on Kafka. I’m trying to understand what the future of APIs will hold, and where the leading edge of real time, event-driven architecture is at these days. I’m going through the protocol page for Kafka, learning about exactly how they move data around, and found their answers behind the decisions they’ve made along the way in deciding what protocols they chose to use were very interesting. All the way at the bottom of the Kafka protocol page you can find the following “Some Common Philosophical Questions”, providing some interesting backstory on the decisions behind the very popular platform. Some people have asked why we don’t use HTTP. There are a number of reasons, the best is that client implementors can make use of some of the more advanced TCP features–the ability to multiplex requests, the ability to simultaneously poll many connections, etc. We have also found HTTP libraries in many languages to be surprisingly shabby. Others have asked if maybe we shouldn’t support many different protocols. Prior experience with this was that it makes it very hard to add and test new features if they have to be ported across many protocol implementations. Our feeling is that most users don’t really see multiple protocols as a feature, they just want a good reliable client in the language of their choice. Another question is why we don’t adopt XMPP, STOMP, AMQP or an existing protocol. The answer to this varies by protocol, but in general the problem is that the protocol does determine large parts of the implementation and we couldn’t do what we are doing if we didn’t have control over the protocol. Our belief is that it is possible to do better than existing messaging systems have in providing a truly distributed messaging system, and to do this we need to build something that works differently.

			<p>I was talking with the IRS about their internal API strategy before Christmas, reviewing the teams current proposal before they pitched in across teams. One of the topics that came up, which I thought was interesting, was about how to prevent some teams from taking up a defensive stances around their resources when you are trying to level the playing field across groups using APIs and microservices. They had expressed concern that some groups just didn’t see APIs as a benefit, and in some cases perceived them as a threat to their current position within the agency. This is something I see at almost EVERY SINGLE organization I work with. Most technical groups who have established control over some valuable data, content, or other digital resource, have entrenched themselves, and become resistant to change. Often times these teams have a financial incentive to remain entrenched, and see API efforts as a threat to their budget and long term viability. This type of politics within large companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies is the biggest threat to change than technology ever is. So, what can you do about it. Well, the most obvious thing is you can get leadership on your team, and get them to mandate change. Often times this will involve personnel change, and can get pretty ugly in the end. Alternately, I recommend trying to build bridges, by understanding the team in question, and find ways you can do API things that might benefit them. Maybe more revenue and budget opportunities. Reuse of code through open source, or reusable code and applications that might benefit their operations. I recommend mapping out the groups structure and needs, and put together a robust plan regarding how you can make inroads, build relationships, and potentially change behavior, instead of taking an adversarial tone. Another way forward is to ignore them. Focus on other teams. Find success.

I’m taking what I’ve learned from studying the partner programs of other leading APIs, and I am pulling it together into coherent strategy that Streamdata.io can put to work over time. Like any other area of operations, we are going to start small, and move forward incrementally, making sure we are doing this in a sensible, and pragmatic way. First up, are the basics. What are we trying to accomplish with the Streamdata.io partner program. I want to have a simple and concise answer to what their partner program does, and is designed to accomplish. The Streamdata.io partner program is designed to encourage deeper engagement with companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies that are putting Streamdata.io solutions to work, or are already operating within industries where Streamdata.io services will compliment what they are already doing. This partner program is meant to encourage continued participation by our customers, through offering them exposure, storytelling opportunities, referrals, and even new revenue opportunities. The Streamdata.io partner program is open to the public, just reach out and we’ll let you know if there is a fit between what our organizations are doing. It is a first draft, and not the official description, but it takes a crack at describing why we are doing it, and some about what it is.

			<p>A coherent strategy to delivering and operating API portals is something that gets lost in a number of the API operations I am asked to review. It is also one of the more interesting aspects of the successful strategies I track on, something that when done right, can become a vibrant source of information, and when done wrong, can make an API a ghost town, and something people back away from when finding. As part of my research I think a lot about how API portals can be used as part of each APIs lifecycle, as well as at the aggregate levels across teams, within groups, between partners, and the public. The most common form of the API portal is the classic public developer portal you find with Twitter, Twilio, Facebook, and other leading API pioneers. These portals provide a wealth of healthy patterns we can emulate, as well as some not so healthy ones. Beyond these public portals, I also se other patterns within the enterprise organizations I work with, that I think are worth sharing, showing how portals aren’t always just a single public destination, and can be much, much more. Individual Portals - Considering how developers and business users can be leverage portals to push forward conversations around the APIs they own and are moving forward. Team Portals - Thinking about how different groups and teams can have their own portals which aggregate APIs and other portals from across their project. Partner Portals - Leveraging a single, or even partner specific portals that are public or private for engaging in API projects with trusted partners. Public Portal - Begin the process of establishing a single Mutual of Omaha developer portal to provide a single point of entry for all public API efforts across the organization.

			<p>DNS is one of those shadowy things that tends to be managed by a select few wizards, and the rest of an organization doesn’t have much knowledge, awareness, or access at this level. APIs has shifted this reality for me, and is something I’m also seeing at organizations who are adopting a microservices, and devops approach to getting things done. DNS should be a first class citizen in the API toolbox, allowing for well planned deployments supporting a variety of services, but also allow for logging, orchestration, and most importantly security, at the frontline of our API operations. There are some basics I wanted to introduce to my readers when it comes to DNS for their API operations, but I also wanted to shine a light on where the DNS space is headed because of APIs. Some DNS and cloud providers are taking things to the next level, and APIs are central to that. Like most other stops along the API life cycle DNS is not just about doing DNS for your APIs, it is also about doing APIs for your DNS. Dedicated API DNS - I’m not in the business of telling you how to name the domain, or subdomain for your API, but you should have a plan, and be also considering having multiple subdomains, separating concerns across operations. API Control Over DNS - DNS is the frontline for your API infrastructure, even internally, and you should be able to programmatically configure, audit, orchestrate, and manage the DNS for your APIs using APIs. Regional Consideration - Begin thinking about how you name and manage your DNS with multiple zones and regions in operations–even if you aren’t quite ready, you should be thinking in this way.

Fatal Force, 987 people have been shot and killed by police in 2017. Read about our methodology. Download the data. I am so very happy to see this. An actual prominent link to a machine readable version of the data, published on Github–this should be the default for ALL data journalism in this era. I see story after story reference the data behind, without providing any links to the data. As a database professional this practice drives me insane. Every single story that provides data driven visualizations, statistics, analysis, tables, or any other derivative from data journalism, should provide a link to the Github repository which contains at least CSV representations of the data, if not JSON. This is the minimum for ALL data journalism going forward. If you do not meet this bar, your work should be in question. Other analysts, researchers, and journalists should be able to come in behind your work and audit, verify, validate, and even build upon and augment your work, for it to be considered relevant in this time period. Github is free. Google Sheets is free. There is no excuse for you not to be publishing the data behind your work in a machine readable format. It makes me happy to see the Washington Post using Github like this, especially when they do not have an active API or developer program. I’m going to spend some time looking through the other repositories in their Github organization, and also begin tracking on which news agencies are actively using Github.

The API isn’t your traditional public API, but shows what is possible when it comes to APIs at government agencies. The group behind the API has published their Digital Service Development Standards, and is actively using a Github Wiki to layout the API strategy for the organization. To give some backround, the Child Welfare Digital Services (CWDS) is for “state and county workers who ensure that safe and quality licensed facilities and approved homes are available for the children and nonminor dependents who need them, the CALS Digital Service Team will facilitate activities related to ensuring that licensed facilities, approved homes and associated adults meet and maintain required standards.” It makes me happy to see that they are investing so heavily in API, in support of such a worthy cause. Looking around their wiki I found a handful of APIs: Facility Facility Children Facility Complaint Facility Inspections You can also find more about their development process, data model, and approach to security on the Github Wiki for the organization. After looking around more at their Github organization, I found a handful of other operational APIs: Modules API Intake API Case Management API Document Management API Forms API Geo Services API There was also a Core API which they use as a base across all API projects, standardizing how they do things. Smart! I also found their testing strategy worthy of noting, just so I can add to my research. Integration Testing - To run Integration tests set property cals.api.url to point to environment host.

			<p>I’m exploring the different ways that public data access via APIs can be invested in, even with the opportunity for generating revenue, but without charging access to the data itself. I want public data to remain accessible, but in reality it costs money to provide access to public data, to refine, and evolve it. This is meant to be an exploration of how public data is invested in, not how you lock up public data, so please read everything before commenting, as every time I write about this subject, there are folks who blindly declare that ALL public data has to be free, no matter what. I agree (mostly), but there has to be commercial monetization opportunities around public data, otherwise it will never evolve, improve, be enriched, and in some cases available at all. I am looking for opportunities for public data stewards / owners to generated much needed revenue, as well as commercial interests to come in and augment, and build upon what is already available–going beyond what cash and resource strapped data stewards / owners might be able to do on their own. Here are a couple of areas I’m documenting a little more right now. Wholesale APIs - Deploying, managing, and providing access to public data via APIs that are designed specifically for individual consumers. This could be deploying an API on AWS, Google, Azure, or other infrastructure provider, and providing private, or even I guess public access to the data. Delivering a personalized, customized, and performant public data API experience. Real Time APIs - Providing a proxied stream of data from one or many public data sources, going beyond what the data steward / owner is capable of delivering. Charging for the technology, not access to the data itself. Cached - Delivering a cached experience, so that when the primary source goes down, all API consumers are still able to get at historical, or other relevant data without interruption.

			<p>The need to manage APIs is one of the older aspects of doing business with web APIs. Beginning around 2006, then maturing, and being baked into the cloud and markets by 2016. Whether it is through an management gateway that proxies existing APIs, natively as part of the gateway that is used to deploy the APIs themselves, or as a connective layer within the code, API management is all about authenticating, metering, logging, analyzing, reporting, and even billing against API consumption. This landscape has significantly shifted lately, with the bottom end of the market becoming more competitive, but luckily there are enough open source and cloud solutions available to get the job done. Over the last decade API management providers have collectively defined some common approaches to getting business done using web APIs. While still very technical, API management is all about the business of APIs, and managing the value generated from providing access to data, content, algorithms, and other digital resources using the web. Here are the handful of common aspects of API management, which are being baked into the cloud, and made available across a number of open source solution providers catering to the API space: Authentication - Requiring all developers to register, obtain keys, and provide unique identification with API request they make. Service Composition - Allowing for the organizing and breaking down of APIs into meaningful lines of business, and allowing for different times of access to these products. Rate Limiting - Limiting, and protecting the value of digital resources, only allowing access to those who have been approved. Metering - Measuring each call that is made to APIs, and applying service composition, and pricing to all API traffic, quantifying the value of business being conducted. Reporting - Providing analysis and reporting on all activity, enabling API providers to develop awareness, and drill down regarding how resources are being used.

			<p><em>09 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>Logging has always been in the background of other stops along the API lifecycle, most notably the API management layer. However increasingly I am recommending pulling logging out of API management, and making it a first-class citizen, ensuring that the logging of all systems across the API lifecycle are aggregated, and accessible, allowing them to be accessed alongside other resources. Almost every stop in this basics of an API life cycle series will have its own logging layer, providing an opportunity to better understand each stop, but also side by side as part of the bigger picture. There are some clear leaders when it comes to logging, searching, and analyzing large volumes of data generated across API operations. This is one area you should not be reinventing the wheel in, and you need to be leveraging the experience of the open source tooling providers, as well as the cloud providers who have emerged across the landscape. Here is a snapshot of a few providers who will help you make logging a first class citizen in your API life cycle. Elastic Stack - Formerly known as the Elk Stack, the evolved approach to logging, search, and analysis out of Elastic. I recommend incorporating it into all aspects of operations, and deploying APIs to make them first class citizens. Logmatic - Whatever the language or stack, staging or production, front or back, Logmatic.io centralizes all your logs and metrics right into your browser. Nagio - Nagios Log Server greatly simplifies the process of searching your log data. Set up alerts to notify you when potential threats arise, or simply query your log data to quickly audit any system. Google Stackdriver - Google Stackdriver provides powerful monitoring, logging, and diagnostics. AWS CloudWatch - Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS.

			<p>I’m working through research on the world of transit APIs as part of my partnership with Streamdata.io. From what I’ve gathered so far, the world of transit data and APIs is quite a mess, and there is a pretty significant opportunity to improve upon what already exists. In the course of my research, I stumbled across MetroHero, which is an application and API provider that operates on top of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority data and API feeds. I’m still working my way through their website, services, APIs, as well as talking with their team, but I’m fascinated with what they are doing, and wanted to think a little more about it before I talk with them this week. While their approach to improving upon WMATA applications is interesting, I think applying this way of thought to a government API is more interesting (surprise). The MetroHero API is what I’d consider to be an augmented API, operating on top of the WMATA API, and improving upon the data and services they make available about the Washington DC transit system. The MetroHero API, taken directly from their developer portal, “are available for free. In return, we require the following”: You must abide by WMATA’s Transit Data Terms of Use; by using our APIs, you agree to these terms of service. Any data returned by or derived from data returned by our APIs must be freely available to all users of your application. Any paywalled application that utilizes our APIs must also provide a free tier with access to the same data returned by or derived from our APIs. Any data returned by or derived from data returned by our APIs must be prominently credited back to MetroHero. For example, if this data is being displayed to users on a website or in an application, MetroHero must always be visually credited wherever and whenever the data appears or is used.

			<p>I spend a lot of time trying to understand and define what is API. With my new partnership with Streamdata.io I’m pushing that work into understanding APIs in real time, and as part of event-driven architecture. As the Streamdata.io team and I work to identify interesting APIs out there that would benefit from streaming using the service, a picture of the real time nature of API platforms begins to emerge. I’m beginning to see all of this as a maturity aspect of API platforms, and those who are further along in their journey, have a better understanding the meaningful events that are occurring via their operations. As part of this research I’ve been studying the Stripe API, looking for aspects of the platform that you could make more real time, and streaming. Immediately I come across the Stripe Events API, which is a “way of letting you know when something interesting happens in your account”. Using the Stripe Events API, “you can retrieve an individual event or a list of events from the API. We also have a separate system for sending the event objects directly to an endpoint on your server, called webhooks.” This is the heartbeat of the Stripe platform, and represents the “events” that API providers and consumers want to know about, and understand across platform usage. I think about the awareness API management has brought to the table in the form of metrics and analytics. Then I consider the blueprint the more mature platforms like Stripe have established when it comes to codifying this awareness in a way that can be accessed via API, and begin to make more real time, or at least asynchronous using webhooks. Then I think about what Streamdata.io provides with Server-Sent Events, and JSON Patch, providing a stream of these meaningful events in real time, as soon as these events happen–no polling necessary.

			<p>I was looking for the API definition and schema for the Service Interface for Real Time Information (SIRI) standard, but all they have were WSDL and XSDs. I am working with the Metropolitan Transit Authorities (MTA) SIRI feed, which returns JSON, and I wanted to have a JSON schema reflecting the responses I was working with. So I took the WSDLs and converted them to OpenAPI using the API Transformer, which kind of felt like that scene in the matrix where the world around him is beginning to turn to liquid as he pokes at it, right before he exits the matrix. I regularly get the emails and tweets from folks telling me “we’ve done all this before”, when I talk about OpenAPI. I’m fully aware that we have, and have even written a few stories about it. However, translating my first WSDL into an OpenAPI was a new experience for me, and made me think deeply about where we are at in 2018 a little bit more. I was reminded once again of how much we’ve left behind, and how much of this we are slowly recreating as part of the OpenAPI specification, and the other definitions and tooling we are developing. I don’t think all of this is bad, but I do think we’ve never been able to have an honest conversation about all of this. Over the last decade I feel like there has been two camps, those still committed to web services, and those that had invested in this new paradigm. Web service folks have mostly dug in their heals, and proclaimed, “we’ve already done all this”. While us web API folks moved forward with this new realm, somewhat in denial about where we’ve been. Most discussions have been pretty black or white, meaning it was all new, or all old, and we couldn’t really ever talk about things at a granular level, and exploring the grey layers in between.

			<p>I recently worked with a large team on a microservices and API governance training a couple months back, where I saw a repeating pattern that I’ve experienced with other large enterprise groups. They seemed to want the right answers to doing APIs and microservices, instead of developing an understanding of good (or bad) API design, and determining the right way for themselves. The biggest challenge with this perception amongst development groups, is that there is no right answer, or one way of doing APIs and microservices–you need to find the right way forward for your team, and for each project. I get this a lot within large organizations who are just beginning their API journey–just show us the right way of doing it! To which I usually reply with, let’s roll up our sleeves and get to work on one of your services, and we will start showing you have to craft a simple, sensible, yet robust API that meets the needs of the project. I can’t show you the “right way”, until I understand what the particular need are, and zeroing in on what is the “right way”, takes work, refinement, and crafting f a robust definition for the service. API design isn’t easy. It takes time to understand what schema is involved, and what role that schema will play in the request and response of an API. It takes work to understand whether the complexity should be spread horizontally across each API paths, or vertically within a single path, using parameters, the body, and other aspects of the surface area of the API. Until I understand the client needs I can’t fully articulate whether we should stick with a simple JSON response, or a more sophisticated hypermedia media type, or possibly even go with something like GraphQL. Ultimately, I need you to go on this journey with me.

			<p>I was needing an OpenAPI (fka Swagger) definition for the Hashicorp Consul API, so that I could use in a federal government project I’m advising on. We are using the solution for the microservices discovery layer, and I wanted to be able to automate using the Consul API, publish documentation within our project Github, import into Postman across the team, as well as several other aspects of API operations. I’m working to assemble at least a first draft OpenAPI for the entire technology stack we’ve opted to use for this project. First thing I did was Google, “Consul API OpenAPI”, then “Consul API Swagger”, which didn’t yield any results. Then I Githubbed “Consul API Swagger”, and came across a Github Issue where a user had asked for “improved API documentation”. The resulting response from Hashicorp was, “we just finished a revamp of the API docs and we don’t have plans to support Swagger at this time.” Demonstrating they really don’t understand what OpenAPI (fka Swagger) is, something I’ll write about in future stories this week. One of the users on the thread had created an API Blueprint for the Consul API, and published the resulting documentation to Apiary. Since I wanted an OpenAPI, instead of an API Blueprint, I headed over to APIMATIC API Transformer to see if I could get the job done. After trying to transform the API Blueprint to OpenAPI 2.0 I got some errors, which forced to me to spend some time this weekend trying to hand-craft / scrape the static API docs and publish my own OpenAPI. The process was so frustrating I ended up pausing the work, and writing two blog posts about my experiences, and then this morning I received an email from the APIMATIC team that they caught the errors, updated the API Blueprint, allowing me to continue transforming it into an OpenAPI definition.

This is how web services have historically been deployed, but it is also how modern web APIs are being managed. Providing a gateway that you can stand up in front of existing web APIs, and proxy them through a single gateway that authenticates, logs, and manages the traffic that comes in and out. There are many management characteristics of API gateways, but I want to provide a stop along the API lifecycle that allows us to think about the API deployment, as well as the API management aspects of delivering APIs. I wanted to separate out the API gateway discussion from deploy and manage, focusing specifically on the opportunities to deploy one or many gateways, while also looking at it separately as a pattern in service of microservices. While code generation for API deployment is common, gateways are making a resurgence across the sector when it comes to working with a variety of backend systems, on-premise and in the cloud. There are many API gateway solutions available on the market, but I wanted to focus in on a handful that help span deployment and management, as well as allowing for new types of routing, and transformation patterns to emerge. Here are a couple of the gateway solutions I’m studying more these days: AWS API Gateway - The Amazon API Gateway allows for the ingestion of OpenAPIs (Swagger) and the deployment of APIs that connect to a variety of backend services define as part of the AWS infrastructure. Kong - Quickly build API-centric applications. Leverage the latest microservice and container design patterns. And tie it all together with the Kong microservice API gateway.

From my perspective, API deployment might be about which framework and language you choose to deploy in, spanning all the way to where you might deploy it, either on-premise, on-device, or in the cloud. The how and why of deploying your API will play a significant role in determining how stable and consistent you are able to deploy API resources, impacting almost every other stop along the API life cycle. Many API providers still think of API deployment in the context of their internal operations, as opposed to thinking about how they will be put to use. The providers I’m seeing enjoy more flexibility and agility when it comes to API consumption are able to deploy APIs in a variety of languages, supporting a variety of existing platforms, and in any environment where they are needed. There are several concepts that are beginning to define API deployment in this new generation of compute in the cloud, here are just a handful of them. Polyglot Deployment - The ability to deploy APIs in a variety of programming languages. Multi-Platform - The ability to deploy APIs in a variety of platforms, and using existing system. Multi-Cloud - The ability to deploy APIs within Amazon, Azure, Heroku, and Google environments. Frameworks - Leverage a variety of open source API frameworks for deploying APIs. I normally would put API gateways here as well, but because of renewed energy around gateway solutions actually deploying APIs instead of just managing and securing them, I’m breaking out gateway into its own stop along the API lifecycle. Gateway spans API deployment and management in my opinion, and while it should be considered alongside...[<a href="/2018/01/08/api-life-cycle-basics-deployment/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Jan 2018</em></p>
			<p>After seven years of doing API Evangelist I have learned a lot about the realities of the technology sector, versus my own beliefs. One of the things that attracted me to web APIs in the first place was the ability to simplify the access to data, content, algorithms, and other resources using a web url. I could get a list of news articles, post a picture, launch a server in the cloud, and many other common business tasks using a simple URL. To me good API design is more about simplicity, than it was ever about REST, or any other dogmatic approach to doing APIs. However, after seven years of doing this, I’m pretty convinced that most folks have very little interest in truly making things simple for anyone. As API space continues to move forward with efforts to address technical debt, and the cultural issues involved with the technology we are using within large enterprises as a part of the microservices movement–we are simultaneously see other fronts where leading edge practitioners are embracing technical complexity in service of scope, volume, and satisfying the requests of developers down in the weeds, and not taking time to consider the big picture. You see this with trends like Kafka, GraphQL, ad other areas, where we are moving forward with technology that isn’t entirely embracing the web, and introducing some pretty complex approaches to getting the job done. I get it. The problems being solved are big. There is a lot of data. Complex delivery models. Robust, and highly functional applications. Simple web APIs can’t always deliver at the scope, scale, and satisfaction of the very technical folks involved. I’m not knocking things moving forward, but I am asking if everyone involved is thinking seriously about the big picture, and assessing the costs down the road–as well as those who get left behind. Not everyone will have the resources, knowledge, and ability to keep up, and I actually...[<a href="/2018/01/04/keeping-things-in-the-club-by-drowning-everyone-in-api-complexity/">Read More</a>]</p>

I’m using a subway map visual, and experience to help map out the journey, which I’m calling API transit–leveraging the verb form of transit, to describe what every API should go through. One key deficiency I see in organizations that I work with on a regular basis, is the absence of the ability to quickly deploy a mock version of an API. Meaning, the ability to deliver a virtualized instance of the surface area of an API, that will accept requests, and return responses, without writing or generating any existing backend code. Mocking APIs require an API definition, and with many groups still producing these definitions from code, the ability to mock an API is lost in the shuffle. Leaving out the ability to play with an API before it ever gets built–which if you think about it, goes against much of why we design APIs in the first place. Mocking of an API goes hand in hand with a design first approach. Being able to define, design, mock, and then receive feedback from potential consumers, then repeat until the desired API is delivered is significantly more efficient than writing code, deploying an API, and iterating on it over a longer time frame. Over the last couple of years, a growing number of services and tooling have emerged to help us mock our APIs, as well as the schema that are used as part of their requests and responses, giving birth to this entirely new stop along the API life cycle.

			<p>I do a lot of thinking about API discovery, and how I can help people find the APIs they need. As part of this thinking I’m always curious why API discovery hasn’t evolved much in the last decade. You know, no Google for APIs. No magical AI, ML, AR, VR, or Blockchain for distributed API mining. As I’m thinking, I ask myself, “how is it that the API Evangelist finds most of his APIs?” Well, word of mouth. Storytelling. People talking about the APIs they are using to solve a real world business problem. That is it! API storytelling is API discovery. If people aren’t talking about your API, it is unlikely it will be found. Sure people still need to be able to Google for solutions, but really that is just Googling, not API discovery. It is likely they are just looking for a company that does what they need, and the API is a given. We really aren’t going to discover new APIs. I don’t know many people who spend time looking for new APIs (except me, and I have a problem). People are going to discover new APIs by hearing about what other people are using, through storytelling on the web and in person. In my experience as the API Evangelist I see three forms of this in action: 1) APIs talking about their API use cases on their blog 2) Companies telling stories about their infrastructure on their blog 3) Individuals telling stories about the APIs they use in job, side projects, and elsewhere. This represent the majority of ways in which I discover new APIs. Sure, as the API Evangelist I will discover new APIs occasionally by scouring Github, Googling, and harvesting social media, but I am an analyst. These three ways will be how the average person discovers new APIs. Which means, if you want your API to be discovered, you need to be telling stories about it.

			<p>I look at a lot of APIs. When I land on the home page of an API portal, more often than not I am lost, confused, and unsure of what I need to do to get started. Us developers are very good at complexifying things, and making our APIs implementations as messy as our backends, and the API ideas in our heads. I suffer from this still, and I know what it takes to deliver a simple, useful API experience. It just takes time, resources, as well as knowledge to it properly, and simply. Oh, and caring. You have to care. I am always on the hunt for good examples of simple API implementations that people can emulate, that aren’t the API rockstars like Twilio and Stripe who have crazy amounts of resources at their disposal. One good example of a simple, useful, well presented API can be found with the Transit Feeds API, which aggregates the feeds of many different transit providers around the world. When I land on the home page of Transit Feeds, I immediately know what is going on, and I go from home page to making my first API call in under 60 seconds–pretty impressive stuff, for a home grown API project. While there are still some rough edges, Transit Feeds has all the hallmarks of a quality API implementation. Simple UI, with a clear message about what it does on the home, but most importantly an API that does one thing, and does it well–providing access to transit feeds. The site uses Github OAuth to allow me to instantly sign up and get my API key–which is how ALL APIs should work. You land on the portal, you immediately know what they do, and you have your keys in hand, making an API call, all without having to create yet another API developer account.

API design is not just about REST. Sure, a great deal of the focus within this stop along the API journey will be focused on REST, but this is because it is the dominant methodology at this moment in time. API design is about establishing a framework for how you will consistently craft your APIs across teams, whether they are REST, GraphQL, Microservices, or even gRPC. Your API design strategy might be dominated by RESTful practices, especially early on in your journey, but API design should not be considered to be only REST methodologies. In the last five years API design has matured into its own discipline, focusing on a define and design first approach to developing APIs, shifting away from a code then document approach we’ve seen dominate for the last decade, and is still common place at many organizations. There are a handful of tooling, and websites that have emerged to help API providers, architects, developers, and designers get a handle on this stop along the API journey–here are just a few. Swagger Editor - Leverage the Swagger editor for manually working with OpenAPI definitions. Apicurio - A robust, and beautiful open source tool for designing APIs. API Design Guide - Continue to establish, evolve, and disseminate the organizational API design guide, providing guidance for all teams–make sure there is a feedback loop involved with its development.

I’m using a subway map visual, and experience to help map out the journey, which I’m calling API transit–leveraging the verb form of transit, to describe what every API should go through. Defining an API is the first stop along any API journey. When I say definitions, I’m not just talking about OpenAPI (fka Swagger), and specifically definitions for the surface area of your API. I’m talking about defining your idea, your goals, and the standard aspects of doing business with APIs. By API definitions, I mean having a robust toolbox of definitions for everything that is going into your API operations, from standardized dates and currencies, to common data schema, and yes to making sure there is an active OpenAPI definition for every single one of your APIs. I’d say that 75% of the companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies I’m talking with about APIs begin API development by coding. A very costly, and rigid approach to defining a solution to a problem. Many of the groups I know who are using OpenAPI in their operations still rely on it being generated from systems and code, and do not actually hand-define, or hand-craft the definitions for their APIs, which should be being applied across API operations, not just for delivering documentation. When it comes to establishing a robust API definition strategy for operations, I recommend starting with a handful of tools and concepts. OpenAPI - Ensuring there are OpenAPI definitions for ALL APIs / microservices. JSON Schema - Ensuring there are robust JSON schema for all data in use. Postman Collections - Postman’s proprietary format for defining APIs, which can be translated to and from OpenAPI.

			<p>I was sitting in an IT architectural planning meeting for a large enterprise organization the other day, and one of the presentation from one of the executives contained a complex diagram of their IT infrastructure, with a column to the right showing a simple five step Alexa conversation, asking a specific question from customer. Each question posed as part of the Alexa conversation theoretically accessed a different system, weaving a pretty complex web of IT connections, to enable this simple conversation. This presentation reflects why I feel that Alexa Skills development poses some interesting questions in the API world, and why the platform becomes interesting to so many business users. It reflects the end goal of why we are doing all of this (in theory), but then quickly illustrates how complicated we’ve actually made all of this, demonstrating how challenging delivering conversational interfaces will be in reality. There are many conversational challenges in enabling our system to be able to talk with humans, but I think many of the most daunting challenges companies will face in coming years will be to actually get at the right data to provide a relevant answer to questions poised in voice, bot, and other conversationally-enabled solutions. Being able to quickly respond to information requests is why many companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are doing APIs. Being able to respond to them in real time conversations is definitely a question of doing APIs, but I’m finding in most organizations it is more about solving human and political questions, than it is just a technical one. Sure, you can envision the most beautiful stack of microservices reaching into every aspect of your organization(s), and even develop a robust conversational layer for answering questions posed across that stack, but delivering it all consistently, at scale, across multiple teams of human beings will never be easy, or quick.

			<p>I was talking with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about their internal API strategy the week before Christmas, sharing my thoughts on the strategy that they were pitching internally when it comes to the next phase of their API journey. One topic that kept coming up is the firm line of separate between public and private APIs, which you kind of get at an organization like the IRS. It isn’t really the type of organization you want to be vague about this line, making sure everyone understands where an API should be consumed, and where it should not be consumed. Even with that reality, I still made the suggestion that they should be treating ALL APIs like they are public. I clarified by saying you shouldn’t be getting rid of the hard line dictating whether or not an API is internal or external, but if you treat them all like they are public, and act like they are all under threat, you will be better off for it. This peaked their interest, was something they did not expect to hear from me, and was something they would be adding to their recommendations for the next version of their API strategy. The first benefit of treating your internal APIs like they are public is when it come to security, logging, and overall API management. You have the tools in place to catch any threats, and develop awareness regarding how an API is being used, both good and bad. While the threats might be minimized internally, developing the same awareness, and having the tools to identify who is using what, and respond accordingly will benefit operations. API security isn’t just about firewalls, it is about an awareness of who is using what. The next benefit is about the future of your APIs. If you treat APIs like they are public, and you ever want to make it public, you will be in much better shape.

			<p>I’ve been looking for sources of transit data as part of some research I’m doing with Streamdata.io. Like most industries I study as part of my API research, it is a mess. There is no single source of truth, lack of robust open source solutions, government PDFs acting as databases, and tech companies extracting as much value as they can, and giving as little in return as they possibly can. Todays frustration centers around the unfortunately common federal government PDF database, or more specifically, the National Transit Database (NTD). In 2017, when you publish something to the web as a “database”, it should be machine readable. There is some valuable data in the agency profile reports for the 800+ transit agencies available in the database, but this information is locked up in PDFs. You can find machine readable, historic versions of this data up to 2015 in data.gov, but for 2016, and 2017, the data is only available in individual PDFs for each agency profile. To make things more difficult, the listing of transit agencies uses some Ajax voodoo for its pagination and detail pages, making it even harder to scrape, on top of rendering each agencies detail useless by storing it as a PDF. I understand why government is stuck in this mode. The systems they use only provide them with PDF as a their primary output. Staff hasn’t been trained on the importance of making data available in machine readable formats. People just don’t understand the negative impact they are making on the life of their data, and how it restricts people putting it to work. In some cases, people are fully aware of this, and want to limit how the data gets used, interpreted, keeping them as the definitive source of truth. I’m not saying this is what the Federal Transit Agency (FTA) is up to, but I’m saying it is the effect of their actions, which is having a chilling effect...[<a href="/2018/01/02/the-national-transit-database-ntd-needs-to-be-an-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>It is always telling when folks assume I mean REST when I say API. While the web dominates my definition of API, and REST is definitely a leading architectural style, these assumptions always define the people who bring them to the table, more than they ever do me. I’m in the business of studying how people are applying programmatic interfaces using the web. To reflect my research I’ve been evolving a diagram of my toolbox that I’ve been publishing as part of workshops, presentations, and some talks I’m preparing for 2018. It reflects what I’m seeing as the evolving API toolbox that I’m seeing companies working with, and a diversity in which I’m encouraging others to think about more, as we choose to ignore the polarizing forces in the API sector. To set the tone for any API conversation I am participating in, I prefer to introduce the concept of the API toolbox including more tools than just REST, acknowledging that there are a growing number of tools in our API infrastructure toolbox which can be applied to different APIs, to solve a variety of problems and challenges we face. Also we need to be more honest about the fact that there are many legacy solutions still in use across large organizations, even as we consider adopting the latest in leading edge approaches to API deployment in newer projects. HTTP - Leverage the web, and the HTTP standard across ALL API efforts. SOAP - Acknowledging there are still a number of SOAP services in use.

			<p>I have been evolving my approach to mapping out all the stops along my API research, using a subway map approach lately. It has been something I’ve been working on since 2014, and had developed as a keynote talk in 2015. My goal is to be able to lay out simple, as well as increasingly complex aspects of consistently operating an API. Something I’ve historically called the API life cycle, but will work to call API transit in the future. Right now, I have two main approaches to delivering the API Transit maps. 1) API Life Cycle, and 2) API Documentation. The first is about applying consistent practices to API operations, and the second is about understanding API operations as they happen. In my mind, both these types of API Transit maps will eventually work in sync, but I have to work my way up to that. Right now, I’m focusing on the API Life Cycle version, which is becoming more about API governance, but I’m going to try and rebrand as API Transit. I’m using transit as a verb, “pass across or through” a standard, and consistent way of doing APIs. What some might consider API design, or governance, but I’m considering more holistically. To support a couple of my consulting projects I am working on at the moment, I have published a simple API Transit project to help navigate some API teams through what I’d consider to be the basics they should be considering as they look to standardize how they deliver APIs across teams. It’s a basic single line, 19 stop API Transit map. It is something I will keep adding stops to, and expand many into their own lines, serving up much more detail, but for this first project I wanted to keep simple, and speaking to a specific enterprise audience. I don’t want to overwhelm them with information as they are just getting started on their API journey. They still...[<a href="/2018/01/02/api-transit-the-basics/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I’m continuing to break down the technology stack as I get to know my new partner Streamdata.io. Yesterday I wrote about their use of JSON Patch for returning partial responses of changes made to an API that has been proxied through the service, and today I want to focus on understanding Server-Sent Events (SSE), which Streamdata.io uses to stream those events in real time to any consumer. In my experience, SSE is a lesser known of the real time technologies out there, but is one that holds a lot of potential, so I wanted to spend some time covering it here on the blog. As opposed to technology that delivers a two-way stream, Server-sent events (SSE) is all about a client receiving automatic updates from a server via HTTP connection. The technology is a standard, with the Server-sent events (SSE) EventSource API being standardized as part of the HTML5 specification out of the W3C. Similar to Streamdata.io’s usage of JSON Patch, SSE is all about efficiency. Making web APIs real time isn’t always about having a two-way connection, and SEE is a great way to make things streaming in a one-way direction, only sending you what has changed in real-time using JSON Patch. Efficiency in direction, delivery, and in message. Server-sent events (SSE) definitely shines when you look at how it can be used to constantly push and refresh data in any web UI using JavaScript. It’s HTML5 roots makes it a first-class citizen in the browser, but I also think there are a huge number of scenarios to play with when it comes to system integration, and reducing polling on APIs. I think the news, currency, stock, and other financial data scenarios are the low hanging fruit, but I feel like Streamdata.io as a rapid deploy proxy that developers can throw in between any API and a system integration is where the killer use cases of Server-sent events (SSE) could be.

			<p><em>20 Dec 2017</em></p>
			<p>When I first started diving into what Streamdata.io does, and thinking of their role in the wider API landscape, I was pretty exclusively focused API providers. Meaning, if you are an API provider, depending on the resources you are serving up, you should consider augmenting it with a real time stream using Streamdata.io. This still holds true, but after using Streamdata.io more as a developer, it is becoming clear of Streamdata.io’s value in my toolbox as an API consumer, and thinking about how I can make my applications more efficient, real time, and event-driven. Right now, I’m just taking a wide variety of existing web APIs and running through the Streamdata.io proxy, and seeing what comes out the other end. I’m in the phase where I’m just understanding what Server-Sent Events (SSE) combined with JSON Patch does to existing web APIs, and their resources. This process is helping me understand the possibilities with streaming existing web APIs, but as I fire up each API I’m seeing it also reveal a new layer of events that exist in between providing APIs, and consuming APIs. I feel like this layer isn’t always evident to API providers, who haven’t made it very far in their API journey. While I study how the bleeding, and leading edge developers are deploying event-driven architecture, mining for the event value that exists within big data, I’m thinking there is also a pretty interesting opportunity in mining the event layer for existing web APIs. Once I turn on streaming for a web API, the immediate value you see is when a new resource is added. However, this really isn’t that amazing beyond just subscribing to a webhook, or polling an API. I feel like the valuable events we don’t fully see without Server-Sent Events (SSE) is the changes. When a price changes. When a link is modified. When content is refreshed. The subtle events that occur that might not be noticed in regular...[<a href="/2017/12/20/i-am-now-realizing-that-streamdata-io-is-not-just-for-api-providers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>20 Dec 2017</em></p>
			<p>I am working with a group that has begun defining their API governance strategy. We’ve discussed a full spectrum of API lifecycle capabilities that need to be integrated into their development practices, and CI/CD workflow, as well as eventually their API governance documentation. However, they are just getting going with the concept of API governance, and I want to make sure they don’t get ahead of themselves and start piling in too much into their API governance documentation, before they can get buy in, and participation from other groups. We are approaching the first draft of an API governance document for the organization, and while it has lofty aspirations, the first draft is really nothing more than some basic API design guidelines. It is basically a two-page document that explains why REST is good, provides guidance on naming paths, using your verbs, and a handful of other API design practices. While I have a much longer list of items I want to see added to the document, I feel it is much more important to get the basic first draft up, circulated amongst groups, and establishing feedback loops, than making sure the API governance document is comprehensive. Without buy-in from all groups, any API governance strategy will be ignored, and ultimately suffocated by teams who feel like they don’t have any ownership in the process. I am lobbying that the API governance strategy be versioned and evolved much like any other artifact, code, or documentation applied across API operations. This is v1 of the API governance, and before we can iterate towards v2, we need to get feedback, accept issues, comments, and allow for pull requests on the strategy before it moves forward. It is critical that ALL teams feel like they have been part of the conversation from day one, otherwise it can be weakened as a strategy, and any team looking to implement, coach, advise, report on, and enforce will be hobbled.

			<p><em>20 Dec 2017</em></p>
			<p>While I’m still investing in defining the API discovery space, and I’m seeing some improvements from other API service and tooling providers when it comes to finding, sharing, indexing, and publishing API definitions, I honestly don’t think in the end API discovery will ever be a top-level concern. While API design, deployment, management, and even testing and monitoring have floated to the top as primary discussion areas for API providers, and consumers, the area of API discovery never has quite become a priority. There is always lots of talk about API discovery, mostly about what is broken, rarely about what is needed to fix, with regular waves of directories, marketplaces, and search solutions emerging to attempting to fix the problem, but always falling short. As I watch more mainstream businesses on-board with the world of APIs, and banks, healthcare, insurance, automobile, and other staple industries work to find their way forward, I’m thinking that the mainstreamification of APIs will surpass API discovery. Meaning that people will be looking for companies who do the thing that they want, and that API is just assumed. Every business will need to have an API, just like every business is assumed to have an website. Sure there will be search engines, directories, and marketplaces to help us find what we are looking for, but when we just won’t always be looking for APIs, we will be looking for solutions. The presence of an API be will be assumed, and if it doesn’t exist we will move on looking for other companies, organizations, institutions, and agencies who do what we need. I feel like this is one of the reasons API discovery really became a thing. It doesn’t need to be. If you are selling products and services online you need a website, and as the web has matured, you need the same data, content, media, and algorithms available in a machine readable format so they can be distributed to...[<a href="/2017/12/20/api-discovery-will-be-about-finding-companies-who-do-what-you-need-and-api-is/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>19 Dec 2017</em></p>
			<p>Sharing stories around your API is something you hear me talk about a lot. Many of my readers like to let me know how they are serious API people, and my storytelling emphasis is silly. Just do APIs. Storytelling is unnecessary fluff. When in reality, storytelling has real, direct benefits on your business bottom line, but also have many other indirect aspects, and its presence is a sign of the overall health of an organization from my vantage point. When you are actively telling stories about your operations, in my experience, it is a sign of the overall maturity of your API process. I’m working through my storytelling around what Capital One is up to with their DevExchange, studying their approach to API governance, as well as the wider role they are playing in the banking, and even API regulation game here in the United States. I can find stories about each of the topics I’m looking for on their public blog(s), and out in the open. This type of storytelling isn’t accidental, it is an intentional part of a maturing internal and external API strategy. Sure, they have a lot of work ahead of them, but based upon my internal conversations with them, and their external storytelling, I’m aware of how far along they are in their API journey–compared to other banks I’m talking to. Take a look at Capital One’s storytelling on Medium. Tune into the storytelling within the DevExchange community. This isn’t Capital One just being confident in what they do, and are able to tell their story publicly. This is part of what you do to work through your API processes and break down the monolith. Check out the Breaking Down the Monolith guide from my friend Irakli Nadareishvili over at DZone.

			<p><em>19 Dec 2017</em></p>
			<p>Part of my partnership with http://streamdata.io centers around me investing more time into studying the banking industry, starting with the rollout of PSD2 in Europe next month. I’ll be working through each aspect of the regulations for the banking industry when it comes to APIs, but I wanted to highlight a recent change regarding scraping that is pretty monumental. In a recent press release from the European Commission they further clarified guidance for third party payment services providers (TPPs), and whether or not they can be scraping data from bank still, instead of using the APIs being mandated by the commission. Here is the section from the press release specifically addressing “what data can TPPs access and use via screen scraping”: PSD2 prohibits TPPs from accessing any other data from the customer payment account beyond those explicitly authorised by the customer. Customers will have to agree on the access, use and processing of these data. With these new rules, it will no longer be allowed to access the customer’s data through the use of the techniques of “screen scraping”. Screen scraping means accessing the data through the customer interface with the use of the customer’s security credentials. Through screen scraping, TPPs can access customer data without any further identification vis-à-vis the banks. Banks will have to put in place a communication channel that allows TPPs to access the data that they need in accordance with PSD2. The channel will also be used to enable banks and TPPs to identify each other when accessing these data. It will also allow them to communicate through secure messaging at all times. Banks may establish this communication channel by adapting their customer online banking interface. They may also create a new dedicated interface that will include all necessary information for the relevant payment service providers. The RTS specifies the contingency safeguards that banks shall put in place if they decide to develop a dedicated interface. This will ensure fair...[<a href="/2017/12/19/no-more-scraping-of-banking-data-in-europe-according-to-psd2-only-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>19 Dec 2017</em></p>
			<p>I’m continuing my studying into what my new partner in crime Streamdata.io does, and part of this research is understanding the details of their technology stack. Today’s work involves understanding their usage of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Patch. When you proxy any existing web API using Streamdata.io, the first thing you get back is a complete JSON representation of the response, but then with each change you just get back a JSON Patch response with only the details of what has changed. JSON Patch is used for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a any JSON object or document and you’ll find used with the HTTP PATCH method. The introduction for JSON Patch from RFC [RFC4627] describes it this way: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627] is a common format for the exchange and storage of structured data. HTTP PATCH [RFC5789] extends the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] with a method to perform partial modifications to resources. JSON Patch is a format (identified by the media type “application/json-patch+json”) for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a target JSON document; it is suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method. This format is also potentially useful in other cases in which it is necessary to make partial updates to a JSON document or to a data structure that has similar constraints (i.e., they can be serialized as an object or an array using the JSON grammar). JSON Patch is an efficient way to only get the details from an API regarding only what has changed, instead of sending everything over the pipes each time. It makes sense that Streamdata.io has used it in conjunction with Server-Sent Events (SSE) to efficiently cache and stream data from existing web APIs. I have to admit I never put this together with the PATCH method for API responses. Most of the APIs I’ve seen that use PATCH, do not actually implement JSON PATCH, so this was a...[<a href="/2017/12/19/javascript-object-notation-json-patch/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>19 Dec 2017</em></p>
			<p>I am evaluating an existing continuous integration and deployment workflow to make recommendations regarding how they can evolve to service their growing API lifecycle. This is an area of my research that spans multiple areas of my work, but I tend to house under what I call API orchestration. I try to always step back and look at an evolving area of the tech space as part of the big picture, and attempt to look beyond any individual company, or even the wider industry hype in place that is moving something forward. I see the clear technical benefits of CI/CD, and I see the business benefits of it as well, but I haven’t always been convinced of it as a standalone thing, and have spent the last couple of years trying understand how it fits into the bigger picture. As I’ve been consulting with several enterprise groups working to adopt a CI/CD mindset, and having similar conversations with government agencies, I’m beginning to see the bigger picture of “continuous”, and starting to decouple it from just deployment and even integration. The first thing that is assumed, not always evident for newbies, but is always a default–is testing. You alway test before you integrate or deploy, right? As I watch groups adopt I’m seeing them struggle with making sure there are other things I feel are an obvious part of the API lifecycle, but aren’t default in a CI/CD mindset, but quickly are being plugged in–things like security, licensing, documentation, discovery, support, communications, etc. In the end, I think us technologists are good at focusing on the tech innovations, but often move right past many of the other things that are essential for the business world. I see this happening with containers, microservices, Kubernetes, Kafka, and other fast moving trends. I guess the point I want to make is that there is more to a pipeline than just deployment, integration, and testing.

			<p>
I’m working hard on what I consider to be my definition of a robust API deployment toolbox, and was enjoying the 100K perspective. As I explore, I wanted to share some of my thoughts about by you might expect to receive as a client in each of these scenarios.


  SOAP: You get what the vendor says we can send to you in very structured way.
  REST: Is this what you want? Let us know if it wasn’t via StackOverflow.
  Hypermedia: We are prepared to send you whatever we want at any point in the future.
  Microservices: You are just going get a little bit of this one thing.
  GraphQL: You get exactly what you want, you better know what to ask for!
  Websockets: Here you get that, and this, and that, and that…
  PubSub: You get only the topic you wish to subscribe to.
  Webhooks: Here you asked us to send this to you–here you go.
  Event Architecture: You get something whenever that something happens.
  gRPC: You get what we want really fast, and can accept what we want really fast!!


It is fun to step back and think about the motivations, ideology, and pros/cons of each of these API deployment scenarios. I’d love to hear your additions or perspective on what you think the client view of the conversation might be. As I see the API universe continue to expand, I’m curious to see how others are seeing it.

In coming months you’ll hear me write more about event driven architecture, gRPC, and how the pace of things are picking up when it comes to API consumption. I’m working with Streamdata.io to help try and map out this landscape, as well as some of the usual areas I focus on as the API Evangelist.

			<p>I am playing with Streamdata.io as I learn how to use my new partner’s service. Streamdata.io proxies any API, and uses Server-Sent Event (SSE) to push updates using JSON Patch. I am playing with making a variety of APIs real time using their service, and in my style, I wanted to share the story of what I’m working on, here on the blog. I was making updates to some data in a Google Sheet that I use to drive some data across a couple of my websites, and thought…can I make this spreadsheet streaming using Streamdata.io? Yes. Yes, I can. To test out my theory I went and created a basic Google Sheet with two columns, one for product name, and one for price. Simulating a potential product pricing list that maybe I’d want to stream across multiple website, or possibly within client and partner portals. Then I published the Google Sheet to the web, making the data publicly available, so I didn’t have to deal with any sort of authentication–something you will only want to do with publicly available data. I’ll play around with an authenticated edition at some point in the future, showing more secure examples. Once I made the sheet public I grabbed the unique key for the sheet, which you can find in the URL, and placed into this URL: https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/[sheet key]/od6/public/basic?alt=json. The Google Sheet key takes a little bit to identify in the URL, but it is the long GUID in the URL, which is the longest part of the URL when editing the sheet. Once you put the key in the URL, you can take the URL and paste in the browser–giving you a JSON representation of your sheet, instead of HTML, basically giving you a public API for your Google Sheet. The JSON for Google Sheets is a little verbose and complicated, but once you study a bit it doesn’t take long for it to come into focus,...[<a href="/2017/12/18/streaming-data-from-the-google-sheet-json-api-and-streamdata-io/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>18 Dec 2017</em></p>
			<p>I’ve partnered with Streamdata.io, resulting in me getting more acquainted with their API solutions, and telling the story of that process here on API Evangelist. I figured I would dive right in and start with the basics of what Streamdata.io does–turning your existing web API into a real-time stream. Streamdata.io acts as a reverse proxy that translates REST API polling into a stream of data. Instead of constantly polling your API for changes, your API clients will poll Streamdata.io and get a JSON Patch update if anything has changed, and reducing the impact of the requests your clients will make to your API. When thinking about what Streamdata.io does it is easy to get caught up on the real time and streaming nature of what they do, but the most immediate value they bring to the table is about making your relationship with your API clients more efficient. Streamdata.io reduces the costs associated with operating your API, stepping in between you and your demanding clients, and act as a buffer that will reduce the load on your servers. Eliminating one of the biggest headaches for API providers, and reigning in the behavior by our most demanding, and demanding clients. I’m always surprised by the answers I get from API providers when I ask them why they rate limit their APIs. I’d say that 80% of the time it is based upon reducing the overhead and impact on backend systems, and dealing with the bad behavior of API consumers. Streamdata.io provides a pretty compelling solution to help alleviate this reality of operating APIs for most API providers. It isn’t just about making things real-time, it is more about cost savings, and minimizing the impact of API consumption on our back-end solutions. Making rate limiting irrelevant, unless you have some other specific business needs behind your decision. There are numerous other benefits Streamdata.io brings to the table, but reducing the load on your APIs probably the most...[<a href="/2017/12/18/reducing-polling-of-your-existing-api-using-streamdata-io/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>18 Dec 2017</em></p>
			<p>You hear a lot about being API design first out of the API echo chamber these days. I’m finding that concept to be challenging for many groups I’m working with due to some of uninformed perceptions around REST, leaving many unable to move towards a design first approach because they are worried if they are doing it correctly. I shifted my own thinking a while back to be more about define-first, requiring that I thoroughly define each API project before I begin moving it along whatever API lifecycle I’ve quantified for a project. One thing I’m finding pretty common across the enterprise groups who have adopted OpenAPI (fka Swagger) as part of their operations is that many aren’t truly using the API specification format to its full potential as an API definition, let alone applying across multiple stops along the API lifecycle. Over and over I see groups “using Swagger”, but when you dig deeper you see the documentation being autogenerated as part of existing development, out of .JAR files, and (thankfully) evolving continuous deployment workflows. While this is progress, it’s not the definition-driven API lifecycle that organizations should be investing in, is is just code-driven APIs—not actually using OpenAPI to its full potential as a driver across all stops along the API lifecycle. Getting your hands dirty in the defining, designing, and crafting of OpenAPI definitions is where rubber really begins to meet the road in implementing the API specification. Sure, you can still be autogenerating the specifications from your services and tooling, but you should be actively polishing, and rounding off the rough edges in an API design tool, and putting your definitions to work in an API client like Restlet or Postman to truly define what your API does, or what it doesn’t do. Then taking your definitions and generating server side code, importing into your API gateway, building SDKs, and publishing your documentation and tests.

I explained to him that I will help fill his head with my knowledge of the API space, as well as be completely transparent around our strategy through storytelling here on API Evangelist. This is one of the reasons I jumped at the opportunity to partner with the team, because of their willingness to let me share what I do with the team, but also tell the story in real-time, streaming (pun intended) our day to day activities here on API Evangelist. I’ll be working 50% of my time on website copy, white papers, as well as evangelism and platform strategy for them, but the other 50% of the time I will be telling the story of what I did for them, here on the blog for me readers to learn from. This is essentially what I’ve been doing for API Evangelist for the last seven years, except I’ve crafted my storytelling based upon rolling waves of many partners, as well as ongoing private conversations I’ve had with API providers, and service providers across the space. I’m going to keep this up, but now it will be centered around the work I’m doing for Streamdata.io, as well as talking to their customers to better understand what they need when it comes to delivering regular web APIs, as well as streaming, real-time APIs. I know that Damian nodded his head when I explained this, but I’m guessing he doesn’t fully get how he is going to be thrust into the center of my storytelling, as we work together to develop Streamdata.io’s evangelism strategy, build prototypes, and the other fun things we have planned–he will soon enough! ;-) I’m working right now with Damian to create a list of API providers who would immediately...[<a href="/2017/12/11/warming-up-api-providers-we-are-targeting-for-using-streamdata-io-with/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2017/12/11/cost-saving-analysis-for-washington-metropolitan-area-transit-authority/">Cost Saving Analysis For Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority</a></h3>
			<p><em>11 Dec 2017</em></p>
			<p>
Even before I engaged with Streamdata.io on our current partnership, I was working with them to quantity the value they bring to the table with their service. As I was working on my story regarding the roubling terms of service changes From Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) data APIs, the Streamdata.io team was running a cost savings analysis on the WMATA APIs. This is where they take their web API, and see what they could save if they used Streamdata.io, and turned it into a streaming API.

The Streamdata.io team took the WMATA Real-Time Bus PredictionsAPI, and assessed the efficiency gains for WMATA when it comes to their most demanding API consumers. Here are the bandwidth and CPU savings:


  Client Bandwidth (BW) Savings - 88%
  Server Bandwidth (BW) Savings - 99%
  Server CPU Savings - 87%


Streamdata.io does this by being stood up in front of the WMATA web API and caching the results, then only showing changes to clients–in real-time. This isn’t just about making something real-time, it is about reducing the number of times API consumers need to be polling an API. When it comes to transit data you can imagine that the client is probably polling every second to see what has changed.

I’m learning about Streamdata.io’s process for calculating these savings, which is why I’m writing this story. I’m going to work to help apply this to many other APIs, as well as look at productizing the tool so that maybe it can become a self-service tool for other API providers to evaluate their own cost savings, if they went to a real-time way of doing things. To help me understand the savings beyond WMATA, I’m going to be doing benchmarks across all the other US transit provides, and see what kind of numbers I can generate.

Disclosure: Streamdata.io is a paid API Evangelists partner.

			<p><em>11 Dec 2017</em></p>
			<p>Some of you in my backchannels know that I’ve been shopping around for a job lately. I’m looking to make a shift in API Evangelist, as I’ve written about some (and will write about more), and I’m also looking for a shift in how I fund my world. During a multi-week search I opened up conversations about a couple of different roles, and one particularly interesting partnership came my way from a company I’ve been working with for a while now. I’ve entered into a partnership with the Streamdata.io team, to help them chart the course for their real-time, streaming, event-sourced future, and they’ll continue to invest in me being the API Evangelist. In the past I’ve had several partners at any one time, but moving forward I’m going to limit it to being with a single partner–changing the formula a little bit. I’ll talk about why the older model wasn’t working in other posts on my personal blog, but moving forward API Evangelist will continue to be about my research into the wider API space, but it will increasingly have a focus about what I’m also doing with Streamdata.io. I’m interested in helping Streamdata.io understand that API sector, while I am helping my readers understand what Streamdata.io does. I will be actively telling stories about what I’m up to on a daily basis via API Evangelist, and I will continue to research the wider API space–this is valuable to Streamdata.io, and hopefully it is also valuable to you. I will also be applying this knowledge to helping the Streamdata.io team help define their place in the API sector, and telling the stories in real-time on API Evangelist–this is valuable to Streamdata.io, and hopefully it is also valuable to you. Streamdata.io is all about helping define the real-time, streaming layer of the API space–something I have been focused on for a number of years. However, they also invested into helping define the data streaming, event-sourced...[<a href="/2017/12/11/api-evangelist-and-streamdata-io/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2017/12/06/will-apis-still-be-relevant/">Will APIs Still Be Relevant?</a></h3>
			<p><em>06 Dec 2017</em></p>
			<p>I named my blog, company, as well assumed my own title as “API Evangelist” in 2010. Every year since making that decision I’ve questioned it, and wonder if the concept and acronym will fade away. First of all, I have to admit its a bullshit concept in the first place. Its an acronym. It’s a pretty wide umbrella that allows us (me) to assemble a wide variety of technological concepts underneath. However, I made an investment in it, I was going to continue. I found some meaning that I was able to articulate to others, that would make an impact on businesses, organizations, institutions, and government agencies. It works. I am going to run with it, and in 2017, I’m renewing that perspective, and keeping it as my brand, title, and the central message I’m peddling in the tech sector. This all contributes to a significant under tow on my reality, pushing me to question reality on a regular basis. However, I’d say the strongest current I struggle with in this area is when it comes to endless waves of trends that crash on the shore. Maybe API is irrelevant because of microservices? Wait, maybe it is because of GraphQL? Sure, it will become irrelevant because of Kafka? Web APIs can’t do everything, and it something that will surely render them the wrong choice, just around the corner. There is truth in all of these statements. However, these statements are also just the nature of the game. Web APIs played these same cards when it came onto the scene. REST replaced SOAP, and JSON replaced XML. It is how the technology game is played. The frontline of this sector will always be developing and evangelizing new tools. It is how it disrupts, and builds new markets. I’m complicit in this. However, the mainstream world won’t ever move as fast as the frontline. No matter how much we want it to. Change just doesn’t happen that...[<a href="/2017/12/06/will-apis-still-be-relevant/">Read More</a>]</p>
