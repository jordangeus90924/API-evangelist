{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im increasingly finding a companys approach to using Github, a vital signal of the health of a company, their team, and the products and services they are delivering.An example of this is with social data platform, DataSifts new open source area.DataSift has thrown up a Github page which re-enforces the companys commitment to consuming and producing open source software, as well as a list of important, Github driven signals: Latest Updates - The latest repository updates acorss all of DataSifts repositories API Client Libraries - Java, Python, Ruby, PHP and other client libraries for the DataSift API Public Github Repos - Other tools and utilities that are avaiable via DataSift Github repositories Job Vacancies - A listing of current job openings at DataSift I think DataSift approach is a very meaningful demonstration in the potential of being open.Â As a company, DataSift provides access to valuable social signals, that any company can access via their interface and API, allowing them to develop insight and intelligence.If you look closely at their approach to deploying their Github hosted, open source site, it provides four very critical signals.</p>
