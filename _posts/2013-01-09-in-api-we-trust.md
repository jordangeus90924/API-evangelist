If you've met me in person, you know I always wear my logo on my t-shirt.  I'm not a graphic designer, and when I needed a logo for [API Evangelist][1], I just wrapped the words in JSON and called it good.  It has stuck.  

When I was in France speaking at [API Days][2], the art director at [faberNovel][3] drew some [very cool sketches of me][4].  He recently followed up with some more high resolution images I can use for t-shirts.

Very cool! Thank you so much Benoit Talabot and [faberNovel][3]!  I'm working on ordering some t-shirts using the work, right now on Inkd.
