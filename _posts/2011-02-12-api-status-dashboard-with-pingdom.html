<a href="https://www.pingdom.com/" target="_blank">Pingdom</a> is a Software as a Service(SaaS) that provides <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/" target="_blank">website monitoring and up-time reporting</a>.<p>
Recently they started <a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2011/02/08/new-public-report-from-pingdom-enters-beta/" target="_blank">offering public report pages</a>.  These reports or status pages allows you to make some or all of your monitoring results public, promoting transparency with your users.<p>
These status pages can easily be converted to deliver an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> status page for your developer community.  Pingdom provides HTTP and Custom HTTP monitoring that gives you enough tools to monitor a RESTful API and provide reporting.<p>

Since the public reports are hosted at Pingdom, they will be available even when your own website is down.<p>
In addition to a basic up and down status dashboard, Pingdom also provides visual charts and graphs:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Uptime and response time charts.</li>
	<li>Response time global map.</li>
	<li>Daily and monthly overviews.</li>
	<li>Customizable history (how far back in time the reports go).</li>
	<li>Customizable design (colors, logo).</li>
</ul>

The charts are built using HTML, <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/css/">CSS</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/javascript/">JavaScript</a> (to avoid flash), so they work across browsers and on <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/iphone/">IPhone</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/ipad/">IPad</a> and other mobile devices.<p>
Pingdom provides a basic and business account, both with a 30 day trial period.  One more ready-to-go API building block to deliver your <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API Community</a>.
