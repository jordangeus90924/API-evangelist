The organizers of [APIs Days][1] asked me at the last moment if I'd like to do a third talk at the European API event, due to last minute cancellations.  Of course, I jumped on the opportunity to generate to material and work through it in front of a live audience.  

The talk was on [business models for your API as a start-up][2].  On the plane ride over I reviewed [John Musser's great material on API business models][3], and prepared a walk through, from a startup's perspective.  

Then after watching Guillaume Ballas ([@guillaumebalas][4]) from 3Scale give his talk [APIs for Biz Dev 2.0, Which Business Model?][5]  And watching other speakers I decide to scrap what I had put together, and went an entirely different direction.

I decide to walk through the evolution of an imaginary startup, keeping in mind 3Scale's philosphy that:

> Let's not ask what business model for my API.You should be deploying an API for your business model. @[3scale][6] @[guillaumebalas][4] [#apidays][7]
>
> — Kin Lane (@kinlane) [December 3, 2012][8]

Then I walked through what I would consider a robust, healthy startup business model with five tiers:

  * Free users
  * Paid users
  * Free developers
  * Paid developers
  * Partners
  * Incubation

Of course, this approach isn't for every startup.  I highly recommend checking out 3Scale's presentation if you want to better understand [which API business model is right for your startup][5].

I wanted to tell the story of how you could apply some or all of the monetization strategies outlined by John Musser in his work, while also listening to Guillaume from [3Scale][9].

The talk is rooted in my research on the [Business of Twitter's API][10] and experience I've had in the field consulting and building strategies with existing API owners.

You can view the presentation of my [Business Models For Your API as a Start-Up][11], and I believe the session was video taped so I'm sure there will be video coming soon.
