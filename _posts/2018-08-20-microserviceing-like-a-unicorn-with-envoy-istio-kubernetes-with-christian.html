<p>We are getting closer to <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/">the 9th edition of APIStrat happening in Nashville, TN this September 24th through 26th</a>. <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/schedule/">The schedule for the conference is up</a>, along with <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/program/keynote_speakers/">the first lineup of keynote speakers</a>, and my drumbeat of stories about the event continues here on the blog. Next up in our session lineup is <em>“Microservice’ing Like a Unicorn With Envoy, Istio and Kubernetes”</em> by Christian Posta (@christianposta), Red Hat @RedHat on September 25th.

<p>Here is Christian’s abstract for the session:

<p><em>The exciting parts of APIs, unfortunately, happen when services actually try communicating and working together to accomplish some business function. The service-mesh approach has emerged to help make service communication boring. In particular, a project named Istio.io has garnered attention in the open-source community as a way of implementing the service mesh capabilities. These capabilities include pushing application-networking concerns down into the infrastructure: things like retries, load balancing, timeouts, deadlines, circuit breaking, mutual TLS, service discovery, distributed tracing and others.</em>

<p><em>As Istio becomes more popular and widely used, we’re going to see a lot of people put it into production for their API use cases. This talk will walk attendees through the Istio architecture, and more importantly, help them understand how it all works.</em>

<p>API delivery, integration, orchestration, and development of mesh networks all represent the next generation of doing APIs, and APIStrat is where we are having these discussions. <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/attend/register/">You can register for the event here</a>, and there <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat-2018/sponsor/">are still sponsorship opportunities available</a>. Don’t miss out on APIStrat this year–it is going to be a good time in Nashville as we continue the conversation we started back in 2012 with the initial edition of the API industry event in New York City.

<p>I am looking forward to seeing you all in Nashville next month!
