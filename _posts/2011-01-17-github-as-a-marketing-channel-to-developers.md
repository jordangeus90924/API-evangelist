{% include JB/setup %}<p>Marketing products and services to developers can be difficult.They are unlike other consumers and often are difficult to reach and build trust with.Recently, I was discussing which group within a company is most likely to initiate a plan for exposing an API: development, IT, Product Development, or some other?And once released who should own the API?I advocate that all departments should have a stake in the API, and whoever owns it after release should have roots in development.</p>
