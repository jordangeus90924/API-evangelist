        <span class="post-date">02 Dec 2010</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/myGengo-labs-contest.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Contests  are becoming a popular way for API community managers to bring  attention to their APIs. Giving away cash and prizes is a quick way to  get developers understanding your API and to get press coverage as well.<p></p>
<a href="http://mygengo.com/" target="_blank">myGengo</a>,  a translation software as a service (SaaS), has cooked up a contest  offering up to <a href="http://mygengo.com/services/api/lab" target="_blank">$30K in cash and rewards to encourage development of  specific plugins that use the myGengo API</a>.<p></p>
myGengo  provides a list of popular CMS, SNS, E-Commerce, forums, browser  plugins, and SaaS platforms for developers to choose from. You can  request adding a new framework or platform if you wish.<p></p>
In  addition to increasing public and developer awareness of the myGengo AP  platform, the company is getting a full suite of code libraries and  plugs for all major platforms on a fixed budget of 30K. Seems like an  excellent way to develop code around your platform while keeping it  within a specified budget and without bringing in any new development  resources or training for new platform and languages.<p></p>
The  myGengo API contest demonstrates a new trend in marketing your API,  building a community, and establishing a wide selection of code.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2010/11/28/overview-3d-printing-and-manufacturing/">Overview: 3D Printing and Manufacturing</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 Nov 2010</span>
        <p>As the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API Evangelist, I get asked why I would be an evangelist for technology in a dying industry.  Print and Publishing.</p>
<p>My primary argument is: Through new technology such as cloud computing, social media, and mobile the print and publishing industry will be redefined.  We won't even recognize it as the old beast.</p>
<p>One example of this is <a href="http://www.shapeways.com" target="_blank">Shapeways</a>.  Shapeways turns 3D designs and drawings to tangible products through 3D printing. <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/shapeways/shapeways-logo.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" /> You can choose from their pre-defined creators to build proven products, partner with other designers to create a product or upload your own designs to the Shapeways platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shapeways.com" target="_self">Shapeways</a> will check your 3D model that you upload to make sure it can be printed properly before sending to their production facility.</p>
<p>Once in production, the 3D model in your digital file will be printed layer by layer using one of four 3D printing machines &amp; technologies:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering" target="_blank">Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)</a> </strong>- SLS is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass that has a desired 3-dimensional shape.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography" target="_blank">Stereolithography (SLA) </a></strong>- Stereolithography is an additive manufacturing process using a vat of liquid UV-curable photopolymer "resin" and a UV laser to build parts a layer at a time. On each layer, the laser beam traces a part cross-section pattern on the surface of the liquid resin.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_deposition_modeling" target="_blank">Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) </a></strong>- FDM works on an "additive" principle by laying down material in layers. A plastic filament or metal wire is unwound from a coil and supplies material to an extrusion nozzle which can turn on and off the flow.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminated_object_manufacturing" target="_blank">Laminate Object Manufacturing (LOM)</a> </strong>- LOM is a rapid prototyping system that layers adhesive-coated paper, plastic, or metal laminates are successively glued together and cut to shape with a knife or laser cutter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plastic objects are printed and delivered in 10 working days, and metal objects take 14 working days to arrive.</p>
<p>Cloud print Application Programming Interfaces (API) will allow web and mobile applications to interface with new print and manufacturing technology spanning facilities world wide.</p>
<p>Cloud print and manufacturing APIs will give existing publishing and manufacturing industries new life, and invent entirely new forms of printing, prototyping, and manufacturing we haven't even conceived.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2010/11/22/print-a-book-of-your-facebook-life/">Print a Book of Your Facebook Life</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Nov 2010</span>
        I spend a lot of time thinking about new ways to print as the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API Evangelist.  During this time I see a common pattern; that print can create more meaningful, physical aspects of our online lives.<p></p>
We create volumes of data through our social streams, online files, emails and other forms data in our daily online lives.  Often times the photos and discussions become less valuable because they are so easy to create, so we lose interest in creating organizing photos, emails or other files.<p></p>
This is where I see print being able to be reborn in creating physical, tangible, and more valuable snapshots of our online lives.
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/facebook_logo-icon.png" alt="" align="right" />
I talked about <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/11/fotobooks-on-facebook/" target="_blank">fotobooks</a> which allows you to <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/11/fotobooks-on-facebook/" target="_blank">print out photo books created from your Facebook profile</a>.  I came across another tool that allows you to print a book from your Facebook profile.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.ninuku.com/ninuku.html" target="_blank">Ninuku Archivist</a> is a Facebook application that automatically downloads stuff from your wall on a monthly basis, then saves it into a PDF doc.   It will pull your profile, streams, and photos from your Facebook profile and create a stored version of these.<p></p>
This social PDF book could easily be send to the Mimeo REST Cloud Print API and arrive on your doorstep as a printed book the next day.   This would be a way to take our online lives and create a physical archive that we can put on the bookshelf for the future.<p></p>
Ninuku Archivist is a little buggy, and the UI difficult to use.  I never quite got my book created.   I see potential though.  With an optimized user interface, and opening up with an API there would be huge potential to create different types of social books and create more  meaningful, physical versions of your Facebook life.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2010/11/19/universal-apis/">Universal APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">19 Nov 2010</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/wall-street.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Many APIs deliver the same type of data like city, country or other factual data.  Other APIs deliver similar functionality like geo-location and currency conversions.<p></p>
The opportunity to develop Universal APIs or Aggregated APIs that bring together common web services into a single source is growing.<p></p>
One example of API aggregation is the <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/11/17/deltacloud-review/" target="_blank">Deltacloud</a> which provide aggregated access to multiple cloud computing platforms such as <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/rackspace/" target="_blank">Rackspace</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/amazon/amazon-ec2/" target="_blank">Amazon EC2</a> via a single web service.<p></p>
Aggregation of APIs opens up opportunities to provide redundancy, deliver caching and other ways of improve API availability and performance.<p></p>
Aggregators will eventually commoditize certain API services such as geo-location, IP address look-up, storage, and computing and will create markets for services such as Amazon EC2 Spot Instances.  This will create competition and ultimately drive down pricing and create opportunities for bulk discounts.<p></p>
API aggregation markets will lead the way for interoperability and standards among API service providers, make integration easier for developers and make it easier to manage the growing number of APIs that are being used in application development.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2010/11/19/api-exploration/">API Exploration</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">19 Nov 2010</span>
        It is not always easy to get up and running using a new API.  As a developer you face all kinds of challenges before integration, like finding and making sense of documentation and authentication and setting up code samples.<p></p>
Sometimes it can take several attempts before you are actually able to understand how an API operates and begin using it.  And often times this can mean not adopting an API at all, because you just don't have the time to spend learning about it.
<a href="http://app.apigee.com/console/" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/apigee-api-console.jpg" alt="" width="360" align="right" /></a>
<a href="http://www.apigee.com" target="_blank">Apigee</a> released an <a href="http://app.apigee.com/console/" target="_blank">API console</a> last week that allows you to easily explore eight top APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Twitter</li>
	<li>Facebook</li>
	<li>Foursquare</li>
	<li>LinkedIn</li>
	<li>SimpleGeo</li>
	<li>Paypal</li>
	<li>Soundcloud</li>
	<li>Twilio</li>
</ul>
Using the console you can select an API for exploration.  It then lists the services and endpoints for that web service in a left hand tree-view menu.<p></p>
You can authenticate using OAuth and select an API method which displays the URL in the explorer address bar, then you select GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.<p></p>
You can then test the web service and see the resulting API request and response.   The Apigee Console allows you to explore an API with almost no effort or coding.<p></p>
This type of exploration is critical in understanding how an API works and helps you brainstorm ways you can integrate it with your application.   I see the Apigee Console reducing API integration time and ultimately resulting in more API adoption.

        <span class="post-date">13 Nov 2010</span>
        <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/peter-gruenbaum/0/41b/695" target="_blank">Peter Gruenbaum</a> of <a href="http://www.sdkbridge.com/" target="_blank">SDK Bridge</a> shared an article in the company's November newsletter that resonated with some of the work I've been doing recently -- creating API documentation for the Mimeo Connect REST Print API.<p></p>
The article is titled <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg309172.aspx" target="_blank">A Coder's Guide to Writing API Documentation</a> and appeared in MSDN Magazine.<p></p>
Gruenbaum says that writing good API documentation requires the four components:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Overview:</strong> Explaining what advantages developers have in using the platform, and in some cases, providing an architectural description of the platform.</li>
	<li><strong>Getting started:</strong> Helping the developer get started, in the form of step-by-step tutorials or simpler walkthroughs.</li>
	<li><strong>Sample code:</strong> Providing well-commented code samples that developers can build on.</li>
	<li><strong>Reference material:</strong> Providing detailed information about each class, member, function or XML element.</li>
</ul>
I have been writing sample PHP code while authenticating and writing calls against every endpoint on the REST Print API this week.<p></p>
I have five developers interested in integrating the API into their applications.   So I have been working on and overview and a getting started guide to our API.<p></p>
I have been keeping reference materials to each web service on a wiki as I play with and learn more about our API.<p></p>
Seems like I already have a good start, and seeing Gruenbaum's list of what makes up good API documentation validates where I chose to start with our API documentation this week.

        <span class="post-date">09 Nov 2010</span>
        I'm going through the my list of existing and potential self-publishing and print-on-demand applications.   First on my list is the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/fotobooks/">fotobooks the Facebook social print application</a>.<p></p>
Its a pretty straightforward app allowing you to organize photos from your Facebook albums into small photo books.
<a href="http://apps.facebook.com/fotobooks/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/fotobooks.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></a>
With 2 clicks you can have the application installed in your Facebook profile:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Click Getting Started from fotobooks home page</li>
	<li>Allow the applications request for permissions</li>
</ul>
The application is now installed and you can assemble and order a fotobook in 7 steps:
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li>Click create new book</li>
	<li>Select cover design, and give book a title</li>
	<li>Drag photos from albums onto 19 pages of your fotobook</li>
	<li>Preview your fotobook</li>
	<li>Enter order quantity and delivery</li>
	<li>Enter shipping and billing information</li>
	<li>Pay $5.99 for the book with paypal express or credit card</li>
</ol>
The fotobooks application is a great example of the next generation of social publishing.  I have hit a point of exhaustion with digital photos and social sharing of my photos.  Social tools like <a href="http://instagr.am/">Instagr.am</a> and <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/fotobooks/">fotobooks</a> have renewed my energy for taking photos.<p></p>
fotobooks is first on my list of applications to showcase what is possible with the Mimeo Connect Print API platform.  It is an existing application, stay tuned for more examples, and random ideas I come up with in my adventures as Mimeo Connect API Evangelist.

        <span class="post-date">09 Nov 2010</span>
        I have launched a new site called <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">API Evangelist</a>.  I have been operating in stealth mode because I'm not 100% done with all the API Ecosystem building block pages.  I've had a couple people ask if I'm a perfectionist, and why don't I just launch.  So here we go.<p></p>
My goal behind <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">API Evangelist</a>. is to go beyond just the technology of APIs or being a directory of APIs like <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com" target="_blank">ProgrammableWeb</a> is.  I want to focus on the business of APIs, which is an area I feel is neglected in over 75% of APIS, even the successful ones.<p></p>
API Evangelist reflects my research, and I'm looking to provide the following types of posts:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Analysis</li>
	<li>Building Blocks</li>
	<li>News</li>
	<li>Review</li>
	<li>Services</li>
</ul>
My goal is to monitor how the leading API providers are delivering their APIs to the world and managing their community.  As I review APIs for the blog I enter them into a database and keep track of building blocks, technology, formats, and other characteristics.  I will be providing more tools for searching and cross-referencing this data as time goes on.<p></p>

This site is my research and learning around the business of APIs, to put to use as the API Evangelist for <a href="http://www.mimeo.com" target="_blank">Mimeo</a>.   As I pay attention to top API providers, API service providers, and best practices around the business APIs I feel there is a lot of value to share, and structuring it in this way helps me learn more.<p></p>
Let me know your thoughts.

        <span class="post-date">07 Nov 2010</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-status" alt="" align="right" />Applications are being built around APIs at an ever-increasing pace.  Developers put a lot of trust in these service providers, and we depend on them to provide a certain quality of service.<p></p>
As a developer, you should build in error handling to deal with service outages properly.   When deciding to use an API you might want to look at a service that monitors the availability of Public APIs called <a href="http://api-status.com/">API Status</a>.   API Status monitors almost 50 top APIS and provide information on whether the API is:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Operating Normally</li>
	<li>Experiencing Performance Issues</li>
	<li>Having a Service Disruption</li>
</ul>
The real-time status report for Public APIs is provided by <a href="http://www.watchmouse.com">WatchMouse</a>.   WatchMouse provides online monitoring services and has an API as well.<p></p>
In addition to monitoring, I would like to see a rating system for API service providers based upon their availability and up-time.  This would help developers make decisions around whether an API is quality enough to integrate with or not.<p></p>
I would also like to see more competition in the API space, then in addition to gracefully handling of API failures, we could also build in failover into our applications.  This would not work with specific services like Twitter for example, but if it is a service that provides a calculation like IP address lookup, or address verification you could have a plan A or plan B when making API calls.<p></p>
We put a lot of trust into API service providers and hope they take their API seriously enough to not only keep up and running, but also provide a high quality of service.   API availability and service level agreements will be critical in the future API-driven economy.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2010/11/07/mashery-business-of-apis-conference/">Mashery Business of APIs Conference</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Nov 2010</span>
        I attended <a href="http://apiconference.com/" target="_blank">Mashery's Business of APIs Conference</a> in San Francisco on Thursday.<p></p>
The event was kicked off with a complete history of APIs from Oren Michels the CEO of Mashery.  Michels took us from pre-Internet examples of APIs through eBay pioneering in the space, the mashup explosion and to present day.<p></p>
Then Mike Hart, Director of Engineering at Netflix, gave a talk on the evolution of its API strategy from crowd-sourced innovation to its API enabling it to deliver Netflix on 200 individual devices.  APis definitely played a part in Netflix out-maneuvering Blockbuster in the online movie space.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/Business-of-APIs-2010.jpg" alt="" align="right" />
After Hart we heard from Danny Boice, from <a href="http://www.collegeboard.com" target="_blank">College Board</a> who talked about his challenges around internally selling an API strategy and ultimately building a successful API.  Boice delivers an entertaining story of his battle to convince his organization to use APIs.<p></p>
Then the event went into series of rapid fire case studies from:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>CityGrid Media</li>
	<li>Quova</li>
	<li>Klout</li>
	<li>Lulu</li>
	<li>Seesmic</li>
	<li>Active.com</li>
</ul>
Mashery's Delyn Simons then moderated a discussion about what developers want from an API.  On the panel was Ron Abbot of Egg Haus, Neil Mansilla CEO of Mansilla Dev and Kent Brewster a Developer at Vurve.<p></p>
I thought one of the most compelling presentations was from <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/chris-vein/7/110/71b" target="_blank">Chris Vein, San Francisco's CIO</a>.  Vein described the convergence of government and technology with his opening of city data, requiring of open source, development of mobile apps, and learning from process and the community.  He is working with other cities to exchange knowledge, data, and applications which gives me hope in a very depressing political landscape.<p></p>
Mashery wrapped up the event with a Q&amp;A session with Ryan Sarver the Director of Platform at Twitter.  It gave some insight into the API operations of the sometimes poster child API ecosystem.<p></p>
The Mashery Business of APIs was a perfect size event with some of the brightest minds that are delivering APIs and brainstorming the next generation of API ecosystem strategy.   It was a great opportunity to network within the industry, exchange ideas, and get my API evangelism energy flowing.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2010/11/07/google-api-console/">Google API Console</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Nov 2010</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Google-APIs-Console.jpg" alt="" align="right" />Google released some updates to its API ecosystem the other day with a new release of <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/customsearch/">Google Custom Search API</a>.  Google also rewrote a bunch of <a href="http://googleajaxsearchapi.blogspot.com/2010/11/fall-housekeeping.html">API documentation</a> and more importantly released an <a href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/">API console for managing your Google APIs</a>.<p></p>
I can't tell you how many Google APIs there are, let alone how many of them I use for personal or business.  I think Google is having trouble keep track of the API sprawl itself, and is moving to provide its users with tools to manage their API usage confidently.<p></p>
The Google API Console allows you to create API Projects and activate different Google APIs underneath these projects.  Within a project you can:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Activate APIs - Select which APIs are used within a project.</li>
	<li>Team - Manage which users have access to a project</li>
	<li>Traffic Controls - Tools that allow you to limit requests to specific IP Addresses, and define how many calls they can make</li>
	<li>Traffic Reports - Analytics showing how number of requests and referrers.</li>
	<li>Keys - Allows you to issue individual keys for different API consumers within a project.</li>
</ul>
Google API Console provides some much needed to tools to help users better integrate their applications with Google Services.  It also goes further to help developers use Google Web services as a platform for building and deploying applications to different users' groups and clients.<p></p>
Google API Console is only available for a limited number of Google APIs currently, although Google promises more APIs to come.   The tools it provides are reflective of the tools provided by API Service Providers such as Mashery, 3Scale, and Apigee.<p></p>
APIs are rising in number within Google and across all industries, and as such, the need to manage access and security and to measure usage is only going to grow.

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/world-bank-data-api.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Do you have a cool application built on top of your API?  (Hopefully you do!)<p></p>
I'm sure there are some amazing developers who have worked hard on developing applications that make use of your API.  They have seen the value your API delivers and built an application that extends that value to their users.<p></p>
An application showcase could be an important building block of your API community.   An application showcase can provide an great way to reward your developers with exposure.  It also will make them feel like an important part of your community.   This is a great way to encourage their participation in other areas of your API ecosystem.<p></p>
An application showcase also can inspire new developers looking for ideas of how they can use your API.  Developers might not understand how to put your API to use, and seeing how other community members have used the API may help.  You never know -- your community may even show you some ways of using your API that you never have thought of.<p></p>
You can see application showcases being use by successful APIs such as <a href="http://www.zemanta.com/blog/category/api-showcase/">Zemanta</a>, <a href="https://www.x.com/community/ppx/showcase">Paypal</a>, <a href="http://google-code-featured.blogspot.com/search/label/base">Google, and even the </a><a href="http://data.worldbank.org/developers/application-showcase">World Bank</a>.<p></p>
Consider an application showcase for your API developer community.

        <span class="post-date">27 Oct 2010</span>
        I am in New York City this week kicking off my new career as the API Evangelist for <a href="http://www.mimeo.com/solutions/mimeo-connect.php" target="_blank">Mimeo Connect</a>.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.mimeo.com/solutions/mimeo-connect.php" target="_blank">Mimeo  Connect</a> is the API for the <a href="http://www.mimeo.com/" target="_blank">Mimeo Print Platform</a>. Before evangelizing  about the API I have to talk about the Mimeo Platform for a bit. I have  spent the week learning everything I can about the self-service, next  generation print platform.
<a href="http://www.mimeo.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo-logo.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
What  intrigued me about this job is the unique blend of technology and  manufacturing that is involved. The Mimeo team truly does it, they  have created a beautiful print document builder, storage and ordering  system seamlessly integrated with 3 print facilities in New Jersey,  Tennessee, and California.<p></p>
Once  signed up for a Mimeo account you can build bound documents, binders,  booklets, flyers, brochures, posters and much more. I'm impressed with  the UI and the level of control you have over building and viewing your  document.<p></p>
You  also get a lot of control over the ordering, turn-around, and shipping  involved with your print orders. Get this, you can get online at night  and build your documents, and if you have ordered by 10:00 PM EST, it  will be delivered by 8:30 AM. All without going to Kinkos in the middle  of the night in some weird part of town.<p></p>
I'm  really honored to be evangelizing such an amazing product. I can't  rave enough about the company, its philosophy, and approach to  transforming the future of technology and printing as we know it.?

	<li>1st prize - Makerbot Thing-O-Matic 3D Printer</li>
	<li>2nd prize - 1TB USB hard drive enclosed in a vintage nintendo game (Zelda, Metroid, etc)</li>
	<li>3rd prize - Set of BuckyBalls magnetic building spheres</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://bit.ly" target="_blank">bit.ly</a> encourages developer to be creative and come up with unexpected uses, but it also plants a few ideas that the company woul'd like to see developers work on.<p></p>
There are a lot of developers that may know about your API, but not actively involved.  Your developers may need a little bit of motivation to get them working.<p></p>
An API contest is a great way to light the fire under your development community, stimulate innovative uses of your API, and generate some buzz around your API community.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/facebook-developers.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />If you provide an API, one of the things you will want to avoid is having someone's blog post condemning your company for not caring about developers hit the front page of <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>.  Because even if you are a giant like Facebook, you really cannot afford to have your API be an excruciating experience (although, yes, Facebook can probably afford it more than others).<p></p>
Seth Call recently wrote a blog post called <a href="http://www.sethcall.com/blog/2010/09/30/facebook-api-does-not-care/">The Facebook API:  A Case Study in Not Caring About Developers</a><a>.  And while the post is directed at Facebook, Call's observations about how to (mis)treat your developer community offer important insights that any company should pay attention to.</a><p></p>
<a>The post lays out several reasons why working with the Facebook API is, in his words, "one of the worst experiences as a developer I have ever had."</a>
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li><a>Poor Documentation</a></li>
	<li><a>Poor Testability</a></li>
	<li><a>No Response to Serious Issues</a></li>
	<li><a>Constantly Changing API</a></li>
</ol>
<a>Call's post is interesting as it chronicles (in great detail) how he has had to struggle (unnecessarily) at almost every stage of working with the Facebook API -- a struggle that could easily be addressed with better documentation and better customer service.</a><p></p>
<a>And the latter is an important reminder that while you might not view third-party developers as such, they are your customers.</a>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2010/10/12/google-apps-supports-oauth/">Google Apps Supports OAuth</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2010</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/OAuth.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><a href="http://www.google.com/a/">Google Apps</a> recently began supporting OAuth authorization when connecting to the <a href="http://code.google.com/googleapps">Google Apps API</a>.<p></p>
OAuth will make integration with the Google Apps platform much more secure by not requiring administrators to share their username and password with third party applications.<p></p>
The advantages to using OAuth are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>OAuth is more secure: OAuth tokens can be scoped and set to expire by a certain date, making them more secure than using the ClientLogin mechanism.</li>
	<li>OAuth is customizable: Using OAuth, you can create tokens that scripts may only use to access data of a particular scope when calling Google Apps APIs. For instance, a token set to call the Email Migration API would not be able to use your login credentials to access the Google Apps Provisioning API.</li>
	<li>OAuth is an open standard: OAuth is an open source standard, making it a familiar choice for developers to work with.</li>
</ul>
The Google Apps API services that support OAuth are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Provisioning API</li>
	<li>Email Migration API</li>
	<li>Admin Settings API</li>
	<li>Calendar Resource API</li>
	<li>Email Settings API</li>
	<li>Audit API</li>
</ul>
OAuth for authentication is more accepted by developers, and it makes many IT administrators much more comfortable with allowing third party integration with their Google Apps Premier, Education and Government editions.<p></p>
To learn more about the OAuth standard, visit <a href="http://oauth.net">http://oauth.net</a>.

        <span class="post-date">09 Oct 2010</span>
        There are a lot of things I weigh when deciding to write about a company:  is the product interesting, is the technology innovative, is the company's story compelling.  Some days, it's "news" when a very small feature change occurs at a very big company.  And some days, it's "news" when very big things are afoot at very small companies.<p></p>
Most days, it's not quite so clear cut as that, and I have to wade through hundreds of email pitches in order to decide which stories to tell.  And as I do my research and conduct my product reviews and my phone briefings, one of the things I look for is an API.<p></p>
Although yes, I want to hear that your product has traction.  I want to see that customers and investors like you.  I want to hear about the problem your company addresses, the technology you've developed, your business model, your background, your domain expertise.<p></p>
But I also want to hear about your API.  Why?
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li>An API demonstrates you recognize your product does not exist in a vacuum.  You are not simply concerned with how you interact with your customer, but how your product interacts with others your customer utilizes</li>
	<li>Having an API points to a business development strategy that relies not just on marketing to these customers but on cultivating business partnerships.  Having an API is, as <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> co-founder Caterina Fake argues, "<a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">Biz Dev 2.0</a>."</li>
	<li>A quick look via the link on your website to your API (you do have a link to your API, right?) can give a sense of the strength of your developer community.  Do you make it easy and desirable for other developers and companies to use your API?</li>
</ol>
I don't expect every company, particularly startups, to have a robust API upon launch.  But I will often ask what the company's plans for an API entail.  It's a question that gives me a glimpse into potential partnerships, data portability, mobile strategies, and platform and ecosystem development, for example.  And it's a question that can reveal a company's vision -- or lack thereof -- about where it sees itself, its services, its partners, and its developers.

        <span class="post-date">09 Oct 2010</span>
        The ability to explain your API to developers and potential developers critical to the success of your API.  While it's important to be able to explain to potential business partners and customers about the problems your API solves, at the end of the day it is crucial that you be able to provide them with the tools -- and the documentation -- to actually do it.<p></p>
The importance of documentation -- samples, training materials, guides, docs -- can't be understated.  Quality <a href="http://sdkbridge.com/index.php" target="_blank">documentation and reference material for your Application Programming Interface</a> (API) can be the difference between a developer adopting your API or moving on to another vendor.  And yet these can be difficult documents to collect and/or to write.<p></p>
<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="SDK Bridge" src="http://sdkbridge.com/images/ui/SDKBridge-logo.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><a href="http://sdkbridge.com/index.php" target="_blank">SDK Bridge</a> is a company that specializes in explaining technology through documentation and software development kits.  It provides a variety of API-related services including:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>API Documentation</li>
	<li>Sample code and tutorials</li>
	<li>Highly technical copywriting</li>
	<li>Training sessions on how to use software platforms</li>

These services can be a critical piece of delivering your API.  SDK Bridge says that it is a <strong><em>bridge between people and technology</em></strong>.  So very true.<p></p>
<a href="http://sdkbridge.com/index.php" target="_blank">SDK Bridge</a> provides a set of services that any business looking to deliver an API should evaluate.  Even though you many be able to generate your own marketing materials, SDK and other supporting API documents, you may find more value bring in an outside perspective to make sure you explain how your API solves problems, adds value, and can be successfully integrated to customers systems.

        <span class="post-date">07 Oct 2010</span>
        Salesforce is gearing up for the <a href="http://blog.sforce.com/sforce/2010/10/rest-api-programmableweb-and-curl.html">upcoming release of their REST API</a> on October 26, with a <a href="https://www.developerforce.com/events/rest_developer_preview/registration.php?d=70130000000FV4U">REST API Developer Preview Webinar</a>.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://www.developerforce.com/assets/developerforcesite/developerforce_home/images/developerforce_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><p></p>
The release of the a RESTful API for the <a href="http://developer.force.com/">developerforce platform</a> is a major sign of upcoming growth for the cloud computing platform.<p></p>
REST APIs enjoy lmuch larger acceptance in the developer community compared to SOAP APIs.  SOAP is a favorite amongst the enterprise and hard-core development communities, but REST is easier to understand and have lower barriers of entry for more web 2.0 oriented programmers.<p></p>
As cloud computing is gaining acceptance with the masses, and the smoke is clearing around how to actually make the cloud work,  SalesForce is making a major move to woo more businesses and developers to their platform.<p></p>
I think this is just a first of many moves by the proven cloud platform to not only defend their position as the leader in Platform as a Service, but grow significantly in the next couple of years.

        </div>
Online storage and collaboration tool <a href="http://www.box.net&gt;Box.net&gt;/a&gt; offers a robust API for file management, as well as an &lt;a href=">OpenBox Developer</a> area for those working with the API.<p></p>
The developer area offers the following pieces:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Introduction to OpenBox Actions</li>
	<li>Getting Started Guide for API</li>
	<li>Easy Signup</li>
	<li>Project Setup Page</li>
</ul>
And Box.net provides several flavors to its API:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li> REST</li>
	<li> SOAP</li>
	<li> XML-RPC</li>
</ul>
It also provide ssome some great code samples and libraries in all the top programming languages.<p></p>
There is a list of of all the API functions on the left hand menu, broken down into categories:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Authentication</li>
	<li>File and Folder Operations</li>
	<li>Sharing</li>
	<li>Tagging</li>
	<li>Commenting</li>
	<li>Download and Upload</li>
</ul>
Box.net supports its API with a developer blog and also provides an email address to contact Box.net directly.<p></p>
There is also a mobile API offering.<p></p>
While I think Box.net offers a solid API, the API developer community or ecosystem is lacking.  Its pretty evident the API came solely out of the Box.net development team.<p></p>
The API community lacks consistency and seems to be spread between developers.box.net and box.net/developers.  The overall approach lacks community and even has some broken links.<p></p>
Box.net talks about some partners and API implementations on its blog, but doesn't showcase its developers or partners.   In some ways this makes the API look like an after thought, and could give people pause before integrating it as they might fear they won't get much attention as part of the community..<p></p>
Without actual experience in integration of course, this is all speculation.  Although I think this reflects a common approach to delivering an API.  Companies come out with a strong product, but without a solid business, marketing and management approach it can prompt people to explore other API solutions.

        <span class="post-date">07 Oct 2010</span>
        Several years ago, <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> co-founder Caterina Fake coined the phrase "<a href="http://caterina.net/archive/000996.html">Biz Dev 2.0</a>" in a blog post explaining how several small companies had approached FLickr wanting to provide services that the photo-sharing site didn't feature.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/flickr.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
She noted that Flickr executives had little time in their schedules to arrange meetings to hash out these partnerships, and instead encouraged companies to "feel free to apply for a Commercial API key and build something off the API."<p></p>
"Biz Dev 2.0," she called it.<p></p>
Fake describes the traditional sorts of business development processes -- "spending a lot of money on dry cleaning, animating your powerpoint, drinking stale coffee in windowless conference rooms and scouring the thesaurus looking for synonyms for "synergy". Not to mention trying to get hopelessly overbooked people to return your email. And then after the deal was done, squabbling over who dealt with the customer service."<p></p>
While a Web 1.0 world made partnerships and integration challenging, a Web 2.0 world has the advantage of the API, something that removes many of the bureaucratic, legal, and technical obstacles.<p></p>
So by developing and marketing your API, your company can take advantage of new technologies and new business development practices.

        One of the keys to YouTube's success as a video sharing platform is its successful API that allows developers and site owners to embed, share and distribute YouTube content across the Intertubes.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Youtube-Google-Code-Screenshot.PNG" alt="" width="375" align="right" />
As with many of its other products, Google starts with the essential API ecosystem building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Dashboard</li>
	<li>Quickstart</li>
	<li>Docs</li>
	<li>Sample Code</li>
	<li>Forum</li>
	<li>Articles</li>
	<li>Blog</li>
</ul>
In addition, YouTube really support its partner and developers with:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Partners Showcase</li>
	<li>App Gallery</li>
	<li>Widgets</li>
	<li>White Label Player</li>
</ul>
Google also enforces brand integrity with a few tools:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Branding Guidelines</li>
	<li>Compatibility</li>
	<li>Terms</li>
</ul>
Google definitely has a solid formula for replicating its API ecosystems in its different products, and the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/overview.html">YouTube developer area</a> is an excellent example of this formula being applied to a media API.<p></p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2010</span>
        Change happens.  With technology, change seems to be accelerating, or at least the waves of change seem to come more frequently.<p></p>
I feel I've developed a certain rhythm for riding these waves.   Part of this rhythm is a regular evaluation of where I stand, a sort of agile career methodology.  I'm in one of those evaluation periods right now.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/waves.jpg" alt="" width="350" align="right" />
What wave is next?<p></p>
In January 2007 I found myself jumping on the social media wave, in which I still ride to some degree.<p></p>
In Spring of 2008 I found myself jumping on the cloud computing wave, in which I'm still totally drowning in.<p></p>
What wave is next?  Mobile?  Big Data?  Semantics?<p></p>
There are many things I consider when evaluating what I will focus my attention on.  I want to make sure I will be investing in learning that will benefit my professional development.<p></p>
One thing I look for are constants within all the waves I ride.  One constant I've seen between Social media and Cloud Computing are APIs.  If you take a deeper look:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Social Media</strong> - YouTube API and Flickr API are at the heart of the social media movement.</li>
	<li><strong>Social Networking </strong>- Facebook API Platform and the Twitter API play a big part in the growth and adoption of social networking.</li>
	<li><strong>Cloud Computing</strong> - The two undisputed kings of cloud computing,  Amazon Web Services and Google both depend on API to deliver their services</li>
</ul>
APIs are playing a monumental role in delivering the Internet today.  What is next?
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - APIs make mobile applications possible and help drive innovation in the mobile space.</li>
	<li><strong>Big Data</strong> - APIs allow data to be gathered, shared, and available for visualizations and mashups.</li>
	<li><strong>Semantics</strong> - APIs will drive discovery and meaning around links, documents, and other objects.</li>
</ul>
Pick most any area of business today and you can see APIs either driving or emerging as a major player within that industry.<p></p>
Change is upon me again, whatever the next wave is, I feel I'm secure in focusing on APIs.<p></p>
I am leaving a position as a Director of Technology with a focus on cloud computing to a position as an API Evangelist and with a focus on the business of APIs.<p></p>
This is where I feel future of cloud computing is, as well as many other sectors of our society, throughout business, education, government and much more.<p></p>
Change is exciting.  More to come.

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2010</span>
        As a journalist, I get a lot of pitches from startups trying to convince me to write about their product or service.  And I also attend a lot of pitch events, where entrepreneurs try to convince a panel of judges (typically investors) to write them a check.  Often there are a lot of missing pieces in these pitches -- no compelling technology, no compelling market, no compelling story, and most damning, no actual product.<p></p>
Sure. You can have slides.  You can boast about how awesome your product will be.  You can talk, talk, talk.<p></p>
Or, you can actually show it off, show how it works.  And I do mean, literally, how it works, by coding your way through a demo.<p></p>
And this is what John Britton, <a href="http://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a>'s developer evangelist, does in this video, taken at a NY Tech Meetup.  In it, he not only makes the case for the Twilio product -- the Twilio API integrates phone and message actions into your app.  But by coding the demo live onstage, Britton also makes the case for and to the developer community, which is particularly important for having a vibrant and robust API.<p></p>

        The <a href="http://code.flickr.com&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; for the online photo and video sharing service &lt;a href=">Flickr</a> provides a way for new tools to be built and for Flickr content to be uploaded or shared.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Flickr-Code-Screenshot.PNG" alt="" width="375" align="right" />
Flickr offers a solid API with very traditional building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>API Overview</li>
	<li>Account Manager</li>
	<li>App Manager</li>
	<li>API / SDK Kits</li>
	<li>Email Listserve</li>
</ul>
Recently Flickr evolved its API area (App Garden) and took a more ecosystem approach by creating <a href="code.flickr.com">code.flickr.com</a> by bringing together several old and new building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Dashboard</li>
	<li>Forums (3 separate forums: API Forum, Hacking Uploadr, and Yahoo Forum)</li>
	<li>Developer Feature</li>
	<li>Developer Blog</li>
Jobs Listing (For Flickr, not for ecoystem)</ul>
Flickr's API is a solid example of a simple, yet successful RESTful approach to an API.  A very early mover in building an API, Flickr's offerings may be missing many of the more sophisticated API building blocks we are seeing with the new generation of APIs.    Nevertheless, you can't argue with success.   I believe Flickr's dead simple approach to solving one problem -- photo sharing -- has helped the company deliver a successful API even without a robust API ecosystem.
