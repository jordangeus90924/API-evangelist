I am getting ready for the [Mashery][2], [Business of APIs Conference][1] in New York tomorrow.

BAPI is in its 5th year of bringing together the big players in the API space, to talk about their companies API strategies, and their efforts to reinvent their businesses using APIs.

The Business of APIs San Francisco two weeks ago was a very rewarding experience, you can checkout my [wrap-up of the event][3] for more details.

There are 18 speakers at the New York event:

  * **Andrew Nicklin** \- Director Enterprise Architecture at New York City Department of Information Technology
