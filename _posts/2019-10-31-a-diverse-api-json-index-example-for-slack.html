<p>My friend James Higginbotham had a really nice example of using <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> in a talk I saw him give the other day. It was one of those things that jumpstarted my desire to showcase different ways of using the machine readable API discovery format. I still use APIs.json heavily in my <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a> and search efforts, but not something I've been really good at maintaining as a spec, and telling stories about. I'm working to remedy this, so thanks to James I'm pulling different examples of how to use APIs.json from my research.</p>
<p>One example I wanted to use is out of Slack. So I pulled my most recent APIs.json index for Slack, and made sure it was updated with the latest building blocks, which included an OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Postman collection, and JSON Schema. Providing a diverse example of how you can use APIs.json as an index for your API infrastructure. <a href="https://github.com/slackapi/slack-api-specs">Slack has an OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema available on GitHub</a>, but to round off the index I wanted to make sure there was also a Postman collection present.</p>

<p>First off, I am painfully reminded of the irony in the name of APIs.json coupled with the fact that I'm using YAML. I prefer the readability of YAML when it comes to storytelling, Beyond this, you can see I have two separate APIs indexed, along with a set of common building blocks of the operations supporting the two APIs. Demonstrating how APIs.json doesn't copete with OpenAPI, Postman collections, or AsyncAPI, it actually compliments it and provides a way of indexing multiple types of APIs that are working in concert.</p>
<p>I am working to update the APIs.json website, and put some more energy into the specification. You'll notice I use a lot of vendor extensions to reflect where I'd like to be going next with the API discovery format. Right now, I am just looking to showcase how it can be used as an index of your API operations. Next, I want to continue borrowing from my friend James, and add <a href="http://alps.io/">an ALPS profile</a> for these APIs, going beyond describing the underlying objects that JSON Schema defines, and describing the capabilities of the Slack API. Adding another rich dimension to <a href="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/b2d68bbeeda6ac585e16de5b2a1db187">the Slack API index</a>, providing a robust set of artifacts that can be used to discover, document, and integrate with the Slack API.</p>
