[Application Programming Interfaces (API)][1] are a driving the Internet and our economy. [<img title="API Tag Cloud" src="http://blog.apievangelist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/api-tag-cloud-300x175.gif" alt="" width="300" height="175" align="right" />][2] They drive our online experience:

  * Developers rely on API for key data and functionality in their applications
  * Businesses exchange data and services using API
  * Media and press are using them for real-time analysis
API's come in many flavors: [XML-RPC][3], [SOAP][4], and [REST][5], although [REST][5] is king when it comes to next generation of web applications.

In 2000 businesses were still working to understand the importance of having a web site.

In 2010 businesses are now faced with the growing importance of their API.

If you don't already have an API developed in-house you need to talk with [Mashery][6] or [3Scale][7].

If you have an API, but need to take it to the next level. You need an [API Evangelist][8].
