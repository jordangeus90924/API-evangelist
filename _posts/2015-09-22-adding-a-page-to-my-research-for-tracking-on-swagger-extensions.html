<p><a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com">I have a research project dedicated to trying to understand al things Swagger.</a> I try to add any new research, or tooling there when I can. The latest thing I added was a page to list out Swagger extensions that I find in the wild.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/12/crafting-exactly-the-api-definition-you-need-with-swagger-vendor-extensions/">I knew Apigee has extended Swagger in some interesting ways</a>, but I was coming across other interesting examples, and want to try and aggregate into a single location, so that others can reference and build upon.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/extensions/index.html">There is now an extensions page on my Swagger research</a>. I have added&nbsp;<a href="https://apimatic.io/blog/post/swagger-2-0-extension-for-code-generation-settings">APIMATIC's&nbsp;x-codegen-settings</a>, a couple from&nbsp;Apigee to kick things off. If you know of any interesting examples of Swagger extension, please let me know via the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/swagger/issues">project's Github issues</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/swagger">feel free to fork the project and add to the extensions page using the _config.yml file for the Github project</a>, they are stored as a YAML collection.</p>
<p><a href="http://swagger.apievangelist.com/extensions/index.html">Hopefully we can start centralizing all the innovative extensions of Swagger into a single location</a>, helping us all not re-invent the wheel when it comes to extending the popular API definition format, affectionately known as Swagger.</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)
