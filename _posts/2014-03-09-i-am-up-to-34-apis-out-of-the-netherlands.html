<p><span>As we gear up for&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam, March 24-26th</a><span>, I&rsquo;m spending my time getting to know API companies across Europe. I published a&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/27/apis-coming-out-of-the-united-kingdom/">listing of APIs I found from the United Kingdom</a><span>&nbsp;a few days ago, and next up is taking a look at what APIs are coming out of the Netherlands.</span>
<p>Last week I did a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/04/apis-coming-out-of-the-netherlands/">roundup of 17 APIs out of the Netherlands</a>, but thanks to Twitter, and specifically&nbsp;Gerard van Enk (<a href="https://twitter.com/gvenk">@gvenk</a>) who was curating a spreadsheet of APIs, I was able to double the amount of APIs I'm tracking on out of the country.
