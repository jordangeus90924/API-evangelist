        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/04/04/opportunities-in-api-deployment-pdf-apis/">Opportunities in API Deployment, PDF APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Tag-Cloud-API-PDF.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />I'm spending time evaluating different types of APIs in various categories.
<p></p>I want to see how each provider delivers their API in similar categories, and potentially look for opportunities within those categories for new API services.
<p></p>I'm starting with PDF APIs.
<p></p>There are quite a few web APIs providing services to generate and work with PDFs.
<p></p>The first main group of APIs I notice are HTML to PDF conversion APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="DocRaptor" href="http://docraptor.com/documentation" target="_blank">DocRaptor</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Doculicious" href="http://docs.doculicious.com/api" target="_blank">Doculicious</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="html2PDF" href="http://webservice.htm2pdf.co.uk/htm2pdf.asm" target="_blank">htm2pdf</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Joliprint" href="http://joliprint.com/api/" target="_blank">Joliprint</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="HTM2PDF" href="http://www.html2pdf.biz/api.php" target="_blank">HTML2PDF</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Web2PDF" href="http://www.web2pdfconvert.com/pdf-api.aspx" target="_blank">Web2PDF</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="PDF My URL" href="http://pdfmyurl.com/support/support.jsp" target="_blank">PDF My URL</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="PDF Crowd" href="http://pdfcrowd.com/html-to-pdf-api/" target="_blank">PDF Crowd</a>
     </li>
</ul>Next there are a couple of other PDF conversion tools:<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/PDF_red.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Anything to PDF" href="http://api.danielprocter.com/" target="_blank">Anything to PDF</a> - Convert base 64 encoded data to PDF
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="PDF Alchemy" href="http://www.pdfalchemy.com/" target="_blank">PDF Alchemy</a> - Word to PDF
     </li>
</ul>Beyond document conversion I found two APIs for commenting and annotating PDFs:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Crocodoc" href="http://crocodoc.com/api/" target="_blank">Crocodoc</a> - PDF commenting and collaboration
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Annotate" href="http://a.nnotate.com/api-reference.html" target="_blank">A.nnotate</a> - PDF annotation
     </li>
</ul>Then there was a single provider of PDF document signatures:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="DocuSign" href="http://www.docusign.com/developers-center/developers-center-overview" target="_blank">DocuSign</a>
     </li>
</ul>There are two clear leaders that provide more advanced PDF document management services:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Doxument" href="http://doxument.com/en/developer" target="_blank">Doxument</a> - HTML to PDF, OCR, Split PDF pages in separate images
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Google Docs " href="http://code.google.com/apis/documents/" target="_blank">Google Docs</a> - File Conversion to PDF, OCR, translation
     </li>
</ul>With the ubiquitous nature of PDFs, and a wide range of desktop and web based PDF tools, I think there is a huge opportunity for new types of APIs in this area. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf-ocr.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /> There are dozens of code libraries in various languages for manipulating PDFs. I would suggest some savvy developer:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Identify the most viable business uses for PDF APis
     </li>
     <li>Select the strong set of PDF language libraries
     </li>
     <li>Wrap in a RESTful wrapper
     </li>
     <li>Deploy on Amazon EC2 with PDF storage on Amazon S3
     </li>
</ul>PDF APis is one category of APIs that has huge opportunity for growth in the next couple of years.

        <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2011</span>
        When deploying an API, the interface is just the beginning. You need tools and resources to support the API. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/building_blocks.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> There are <a title="Common Building Blocks Used by APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks that are used by many existing APIs</a>, such as documentation, forums, code samples and other tools developers have come to expect from APIs.
<p></p>When selecting which <a title="Building Blocks to Use for an API Area" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks to use for an API area</a>, there are many things to consider. There are many opinions on which are essential, and this can vary from industry to industry.
<p></p>One thing everyone agrees is that <a title="Metrics and Analytics for an API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/31/api-metrics-and-analytics/">metrics and analytics for an API</a> are a must have.
<p></p>Beyond the common building blocks, many API owners are providing new innovative tools such as:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Application Showcase" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=180">Application Showcases</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Ideas" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=138">Idea Directories</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Contests and Hackathons" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=201">Contests and Hackathons</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="API Explorers" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/24/explorers-open-api-access-beyond-developers/">API Explorers</a>
     </li>
</ul>If you are planning an API and do not have much experience with API technology, or what building blocks you will need, you should talk to experienced API service providers such as <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, or <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a>. These providers have a lot of experience, tools and services you can access to plan, develop, deploy, and manage your API.
<p></p>Even with the growth in the number of available APIs, and the number of service providers I do not see much in the way of open-source API building blocks available on the market yet. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/open.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> We need more innovation around development of open API building blocks. Think what <a title="Wordpress" href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> has done for blogging, and <a title="Heroku" href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> has done for cloud computing.
<p></p>The availablility of open API building blocks delivering the common, innovative and essential tools needed for APIs, would give a much needed boost to the entire industry.
<p></p>There is a lot of learning, exploration and trial and error to occur within the API space. Leaving this to occur within the hands of a few API service provider, or following the lead of major API players like Twitter and Google limits the opportunities for everybody involved.
<p></p>I would like to see more discussion and collaboration around building a community of open source API build blocks this year.

        <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2011</span>
        All of us programmers have a preferred programming language. It is the language that we identify with and prefer to build projects in.
<p></p>When it comes to delivering an API area, one of the most important <a title="building blocks" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks</a> for getting programmers up and running are <a title="code language libraries" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=125">language libraries</a>.
<p></p>Data API provider <a title="3Taps shows how to deliver their API code libraries" href="http://3taps.com/developers">3Taps shows how to deliver their API code libraries</a>, in just one click.

<p></p>As soon as I click on "Developers" off the main menu, I get all the top languages front and center.
<p></p>I can immediately click on my language of choice, fork or download the repository from <a title="Github" href="http://github.com">Github</a> and get to work.

        <span class="post-date">02 Apr 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github/github-social-coding-words.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /><a title="GitHub" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that uses the Git revision control system.
<p></p>The site also provides social networking functionality such as feeds, followers and a network graph to display how developers work on their versions of a repository.
<p></p>Github provides two main tools that can be used in an API area:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Github Repositories" href="http://help.github.com/create-a-repo/">Github Repositories</a></strong> - Git code repositories for various supporting areas of an API
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Gists" href="https://gist.github.com/">Gists</a></strong> - Gist are a simple way to share snippets of code
     </li>
</ul>There are several ways to use Github repositories and Gists in an API area:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Documentation</strong> - Display example calls, requests, and responses using Gists
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Code Samples</strong> - Display code samples using Gists, and package up entire sets of code samples using Github repositories
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Code Libraries</strong> - Package up official and community generated API code libraries as Github repositories
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Prototypes</strong> - Publish API prototypes as Github repositories
     </li>
</ul><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github/github-round.png" alt="" width="160" align="right" /> Github provides a way for API owners to manage a large number of code samples, libraries and prototypes, in a way that allows developers to fork and contribute code as part of the community.
<p></p>The social spects of Github extends a API community to the existing, vibrant developer community that exists at Github.
<p></p>Its easier for an API to participate within the existing Github developer community, rather then expect developers to come and participate in a community built around the API.

        <span class="post-date">01 Apr 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-languages/php.gif" alt="" width="125" align="right" />An important tone of my blog is not to ever say any API owner should, or developers have to do anything. My role as API evangelist is to observe, discuss and explore the business of APIs.
<p></p>I was discussing best practices around API ecosystems with a prominent developer the other night an a O'Reilly Web 2.0 event. He had an interesting perspective on how to build community around an API. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-languages/ruby-logo.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /> Building your API community can start with your code libraries.
<p></p>His recommendation was that API owners should focus on building a simple and standardized API that provides true value, and do not build your own API code libraries.
<p></p>Let your community build, and contribute code libraries in their preferred programming language.
<p></p>His argument was that if an API owner releases an official set of libraries, the innovation stops there. Nobody will build any further code libraries and possibly improve on them. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-languages/python.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="right" /> By allowing the community to build API libraries it gives you a chance to put the spotlight on developers, increases the chance for competition, spurs innovation and developers will rise to the occasion.
<p></p>In some cases an API owner may even contract with a developer to build the API code libraries, but do not endorse them as official. This way developers see opportunity to build upon them and improve them, if they feel so inclined.
<p></p>I found this a very innovative approach to empowering your developer community, encouraging innovation, and building community within your API ecosystem.

        <span class="post-date">01 Apr 2011</span>
        NPR announced their new <a title="NPR News Application for Android 2.0" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2011/04/01/134951191/android-2-0-rebuilt-redesigned?ft=1&amp;f=91000411">NPR News application for Android 2.0</a> today.
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/npr/npr-android-20-mobile-app.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
Normally I wouldn't cover just any new app or feature release, but there is more of a story here than just a new mobile app.  I am interested in the way they went about designing it.<p></p>
Last summer they submitted designs for the new Android application to the <a title="NPR open source community" href="http://code.google.com/p/npr-android-app/">open source community</a> to discuss how to best move forward with designing the mobile app.<p></p>
They gathered feedback from users and built in what the community said was most important, such as new player, universal navigation, as well as adding programs with live streams and the ability to favorite stations.<p></p>
They are working to <a title="publishing the source code back to the community repository" href="http://code.google.com/p/npr-android-app/">publishing the source code back to the community repository</a>, keeping the project open source.<p></p>
Of course this is NPR, a public entity, but their approach to mobile application design using their API is  a model that can be used by other API providers.

<a href="http://www.granatapet.de/">GranataPet</a>, a German dog food manufacturer, created a <a href="http://blog.foursquare.com/2011/03/31/api-highlight-a-special-for-our-four-legged-friends/">billboard that dispenses a treat for your dog when you check in to it using Foursquare</a>.<p></p>
Think about the possibilities when you have signs, billboards, and other types of display that either respond or dispense something when you interact via your mobile phone and an API.<p></p>
Opens up a whole lot of possibilities when you have devices that monitor APIs for specific triggers, respond accordingly, and then developers build software on top of those APIs.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/intents-summary.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Since the <a title="Twitter OAuth Apocalypse" href="http://twitter.com/#!/SNFLabs/status/16426051477">Twitter OAuth Apocalypse</a> integrating tweets into a web page requires writing an OAuth application for even the simplest of Twitter integrations, like replying, retweeting and favoriting.
<p></p>Twitter just released a new <a title="Simpler API Called Web Intents" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/intents">simpler API called Web Intents</a> that makes Tweets more interactive when you display on the web.
<p></p>The Twitter Web Intents API provides a JavaScript interface for adding Reply, Retweet, and Favorite links to a specific Tweet:
<p></p><script src="https://gist.github.com/896788.js?file=Twitter%20Web%20Intent%20API" type="text/javascript">

<p></p>Twitter Web Intents API is an example of a growing trend of simpler tools that make APIs accessible beyond the developer community.
<p></p>REST has simplified APIs making them hackable by journalists, data scientists, and any other tech savvy users that may not be able to program but can understand manipulating a URL query string to get the data they are looking for.
<p></p>More API providers are considering development of simpler APIs, snippets, widgets, and embeddable code that expand their API ecosystem to a wider audience.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-analytics.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I document a lot of the <a title="Common Building Blocks Used By API Providers" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">common building blocks used by API providers</a>. These are common tools used across many industries and types of APIs to build their ecosystem.
<p></p>I hesitate to ever say any of these common building blocks are essential, because every API potentially has different requirements.
<p></p>However, one building block that is essential for <span class="c1">every</span> API, is metrics and analytics.
<p></p>API owners should me measuring every aspect of their API and its community, and be constantly reassessing their strategy based upon what is going on in real-time.
<p></p>API analytics is what service providers like <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a> and <a href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a> bring to the table. Mashery and Apigee proxy your API to deliver analytics, while 3Scale provides a plug to gather data for reporting on.
<p></p>All three of these providers charge you per transaction for this service. <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Google-Analytics-Charts-Stack.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /> To my knowledge there is no provider of an API analytics tool that is free, and plug and play.
<p></p>With the current explosion of APIs being deployed, there is a huge opportunity for someone to provide a free API analytics service that gathers and measures API usage.
<p></p>Think Google Analytics for APIs. A single line of server side code, with a variety of language kits, that will measure all requests on an API, its community, and provide a rich set of reports for API owners.
<p></p>This could probably be done with the <a title="Google Analytics API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/home.html">Google Analytics API</a>, I will have to play with more.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/03/27/a-sensible-approach-to-the-twitter-api-ecosystem/">A Sensible Approach to the Twitter API Ecosystem</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 Mar 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" />I just finished reading two more posts on the recent changes to the <a title="Twitter API Terms of Service" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms">Twitter API terms of service</a>.  There are a lot of opinions on whether Twitter was right or wrong in their approach to reign in their developer community.<p></p>
I understand Twitter wanting to take back some control over its ecosystem and monetize its world.<p></p>
I do not understand why people are demonizing Open APIs or the developer community.  Both made Twitter what it is today.<p></p>
I wanted to put some thoughts down on how I'd engineer a more sensible approach to the Twitter API ecosystem.<p></p>
<strong>Brand Control:</strong> Twitter needs to keep expanding its <a title="branding resource area" href="http://twitter.com/about/resources/logos">branding resource area</a> where users can come to get CSS, HTML, images, widgets, borders and many other higher quality assets that can be used by the community and maintain a quality level of brand control for Twitter.<p></p>
API access and usage.  Let's create some free and paid access levels:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Developer</strong> - A free low volume access level that allows developers to play with the API, but only allows a minimum number of API calls per day.</li>
	<li><strong>Professional</strong> - A slightly higher level of access meant for API consumer that may be building an application, but probably used just for professional purposes.</li>
	<li><strong>Business</strong> - API access for businesses that use Twitter for their own brand, and require a higher level of API requests, but are willing to pay for it.</li>
	<li><strong>Commercial</strong> - A pay-for-what-you-use model, in true cloud computing fashion, with the possibility of volume discounts.</li>
	<li><strong>Academic</strong> - A free research-based access account for scholars to use in their academic projects.</li>
</ul>
With clearly defined Twitter API access levels, Twitter can start making money and controlling usage of their API.<p></p>
<strong>Ad Network</strong>:  The next approach to monetization and control over the Twitter ecoystem could be a Twitter advertising network modeled after Google Adsense and Adwords.<p></p>
Let's call it the Dickbar Advertising Network.  Require all client and web interfaces to have some sort of advertising network deployment.  You could have Dickbars, Dickboxes, and Dickheaders in all shapes and sizes for developers to deploy.<p></p>
Twitter can still advertise, make money, and control their network.  Developers could make money too.  There would be added incentive for developers to build quality applications, and be able to be sustain their work through advertising revenue.<p></p>
With a sensible terms of service, branding guidelines, tiered API access levels, and an advertising network, Twitter could retain control over its network, protect its brand, monetize and ensure a higher quality user experience.<p></p>
This could all be done while still respecting and harnessing the passionate developer community of the Twitter ecosystem that made Twitter what it is today.

<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Apigee Console" href="https://apigee.com/console/twitter">Apigee Console</a></li>
	<li><a title="Salesforce" href="http://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000003IjwLEAS">Salesforce</a></li>

	<li><a title="Infochimps Data Explorer" href="http://www.infochimps.com/">Infochimps</a></li>
</ul>
These REST API explorers allow users to make calls and explore REST APIs using a web interface.<p></p>
<a title="Apigee Console" href="https://apigee.com/console/twitter">Apigee Console</a> even allows you to Authenticate with APIs using Basic Auth or OAuth.<p></p>
The simplicity of REST has contributed to the extreme growth in the number of Web APIs in the last year, and API explorers are going to fuel this growth in 2011 and beyond.<p></p>
API explorers put the power of Web APIs in the hands of non-developers, allowing journalists, students, politicians, and any tech savvy Internet user to access the data and functionality available via APIs.<p></p>
Once a couple of these providers adds an export JSON to Google Docs or download to Excel, its a whole new ballgame.<p></p>
With an API explorer any user will be able to pull data from one or many APIs, export to a Google Spreadsheet and build visualizations to extract their own meaning from the data they've gathered via any REST API.

<p></p>Infochimps is taking large data sets in areas like<a title="Census Data" href="http://www.infochimps.com/tags/Census">census</a>, <a title="Housing" href="http://www.infochimps.com/tags/Housing">housing</a>, and <a title="Education" href="http://www.infochimps.com/search?query=education">education</a> and making them available via an API.
<p></p>Also Infochimps is bundling these data sets and RESTful APIs with their API Explorer. This allows even non-developers to play with large data sets.
<p></p>Some new API calls they've built are:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Qwerly" href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/qwerly-profile-search">Qwerly</a> -</strong> You know when you Google someone's name and through some SEO magic, you can find all of that person's social media profiles? Imagine being able to easily integrate these presences into your applications. Query a person's Twitter handle and the Qwerly API call will return any of his or her social media presences (Facebook, Friendfeed, Flickr, etc) that it can find.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Twitter People Search" href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/twpeoplesearch">Twitter People Search</a> -</strong> Let's face it. Finding new cool people on Twitter can be a bit taxing. Query any word using Twitter People Search and find any user who uses that word in their bio. Looking for other data lovers? Check. Looking for people who like the Green Bay Packers? Check. Looking for Bieber lovers on Twitter? You'll have no problem there. ;-)
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="British National Corpus" rel="wikipedia" href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/word-frequencies-from-the-british-national-corpus">British National Corpus</a> -</strong> Word lists are very popular on our site and we couldn't pass this one up. This API call allows you to access the British National Corpus, a 100-million-word text corpus of samples of written and spoken English from a wide range of sources. The corpus covers British English the late twentieth century from a wide variety of genres with the intention that it be a representative sample of spoken and written British English of that time.
     </li>
</ul>Infochimps is not just liberating data via APIs, they are making it more accessible through their API explorer and data marketplace.
<p></p>You can search for data that is free or paid, available for download or through their API, alphabetically, or by upload date.
<p></p>Infochimps is also looking for suggestions for new APIs and datasets, you can submit ideas using the <a title="Infochimps UserVoice" href="http://infochimps.uservoice.com/forums/55516-infochimps-api-data-sets">Infochimps UserVoice</a> page.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/03/22/twitter-lendle-and-the-state-of-the-open-api-ecosystem/">Twitter, Lendle and the State of the Open API Ecosystem</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />As such, there has been much discussion recently about Open APIs and whether or not third party developers are wise or foolish to build their businesses on someone else's platform. The concern stems from a number of reasons, least of which being Twitter's pronouncements about the <a title="&quot;Rules of the Road&quot; for Its Ecosystem" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms">"rules of the road" for its ecosystem</a>, and now <a title="Lendles announcement that Amazon has revoked its access to the Amazon API" href="http://lendle.me/">Lendle's announcement that Amazon has revoked its access to the Amazon API</a>.
<p></p>The reactions to both Twitter and Amazon have been pretty strong. And while I do think Twitter is making some serious mistakes with its approach to its API and developer ecosystem, we might be making some mistakes of our own if we lump the Lendle/Amazon issue in to concerns about Twitter. Is Amazon shutting down apps that are poaching on its ecosystem? That's not clear.
<p></p>As it stands, everyone seems to be stirring the pot and feeding the hysteria around the perils of using Open APIs, or rather, the dangers of relying on them for your businesses..
<p></p>But it seems to me that there is much more going on here. While APIs may be the focus -- the way in which apps and websites are connecting to a larger platform -- we're also looking at larger conflicts with new business models, whether those are publishing and DRM in the case of Amazon and Lendle or whether those conflicts are around a startup still struggling to monetize its core business. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> This isn't to say that there aren't precautions that people should take when building on an Open API. But when I hear some of the FUD lately, much of this echoes what we were hearing (and still hear, I suppose) about cloud computing.
<p class="c2">
     <em><strong>Your server or storage could disappear at any moment, because its virtualized!</strong> Sure, as would any server or storage, that's why I have plan A and B, and in the clouds I have C &amp; D as well. I plan for failure no matter where my infrastructure is located.</em>
</p>
<p class="c2">
     <strong><em><strong>Your data is not secure in the clouds!</strong></em></strong> <em>Security is a concern everywhere, make sure and have thorough security plan that is revisited regularly.</em>
</p>
<p></p>The naysayers are now making their arguments about APIs
<p class="c2">
     <em><strong>Your API access could be shut off at any time!</strong> I don't think this is any secret about APIs. This is why there are terms of service that you must read and follow. Your application needs to take this into consideration with ALL the APIs it uses -- whether they're from developer-friendly companies or not, and then operate accordingly.</em>
</p>
<p class="c2">
     <em><strong>An API owner could decide to poach business from its community at any time!</strong> Again I don't think its a secret. APIs are a form of R&amp;D for companies, this is open territory for everyone to innovate. In perfect world an API owner communicates openly with developers and partners about opportunities in the ecosystem, plans to monetize, and where partner opportunities exist.</em> I'm not saying these dangers aren't real. They are. What I'm saying is that none of this should come as a shock. You build and plan around these potential issues just as you would with any other technologies you invest in. What if Google Apps goes down? What if your supplier goes out of business? What if FedEx doesn't arrive on time?
</p>
<p></p>Open APIs aren't really the problem here. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/lendle-logo.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /> If a company is built entirely around a single API ecosystem, maybe the owners should consider diversification into other areas, expanding their business. The fault is with the business strategy; it's not the fault of the API.
<p></p>If an API ecosystem grows large enough where business opportunities develop that are ripe for picking by companies or poaching by the APIs owners, then the responsibility is on the API owner to establish a partner strategy that considers and includes ecosystem developers. It's not the fault of the API.
<p></p>Technology is transforming a lot of industries right now. Open APIs are at the heart of this. <em>This is a good thing</em>.
<p></p>Open APIs drive developer and business innovation, and as this occurs there are going to challenges with monetization, business strategies, licensing, ownership, security, and privacy.
<p></p>Let's not blame the API or scare people off from using APIs by freaking out about the dangers. Let's identify the pitfalls, understand their value and establish healthy ways to integrate with APIs, to build healthy business and vibrant ecosystems around them.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/terms-legal.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" />I wanted to establish a base <a title="Terms of Service" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=150">Terms of Service</a> for my API area.
<p></p>So I went and read the API terms of service from 15 top APIs
<p></p>I found the opening paragraph says a lot about how a company approaches their API.
<p></p>Here are the opening paragraphs for the top 15 API terms of service I came across:
<p></p><strong><a title="Twitter Terms of Service" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms">Twitter</a></strong> Twitter maintains an open platform that supports the millions of people around the world who are sharing and discovering what's happening now.

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/idea-management.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" />Silicon Valley is full of ideas.<p></p>
APIs provide the data and functionality that many of these ideas are built on.<p></p>
If you have an API, hopefully you have lots of ideas on what developers can do with it -- ideas that you can share with your API community in order to inspire them to create.<p></p>
Many innovative APIs are building tools for managing ideas within their communities.<p></p>
Google uses <a title="Google Moderator" href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#0">Google Moderator</a> for <a title="idea management in Google Apps Marketplace" href="http://productideas.appspot.com/#15/e=17fe36&amp;t=181990&amp;f=25f853">idea management in their Google Apps Marketplace</a>.<p></p>

Moderator also has an API for deeper integration into other applications of these topics, submissions, and votes.<p></p>
<a title="Google Moderator" href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#0">Google Moderator</a> can be a low cost way for deploying an API idea management system and in turn help cultivate innovation within an API community.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/npr-logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" />Twitter has been working hard lately to <a title="define the rules of the road for the Twitter API" href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/api_terms">define the rules of the road for the Twitter API</a> ecosystem.<p></p>
When it comes to monetizing content and media, there are many differing opinions and by extension there are many approaches to managing an API ecosystem.<p></p>
NPR's approach is innovative, <a title="making incremental changes in technology and business rules" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2011/03/17/134259537/the-npr-api-an-engine-rebuild?ft=1&amp;f=91000411">making incremental changes in technology and business rules</a>.<p></p>
<a title="National Public Radio" href="http://www.npr.org">NPR</a> is improving its API technology to be easier to use, run faster, and deliver all types of content better.<p></p>
NPR is also innovating around digital rights management, to support their <a title="Ingest System" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2010/04/22/126205655/building-the-ingest-system">Ingest System</a> which allows partners to publish content into the NPR system.<p></p>
Managing digital rights and content has its own challenges, but you throw in APIs -- the ability for partners to publish and developers to access this content -- it can't be easy.<p></p>
It's good to see NPR openly talking about the challenges they face, and their ideas on how they are going to keep improving the <a title="NPR API" href="http://www.npr.org/api/index">NPR API</a> ecosystem.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-ssl.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Google will <a title="start supporting use of SSL in APIs" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/03/improving-security-of-google-apis-with.html">start supporting the use of SSL in many of their APIs</a>.<p></p>
SSL will improve API security by encrypting all data communications between 3rd party applications and Google, protecting data from interception by a malicious third party.<p></p>
Google Web Search, Google Maps, Gmail and Google docs all currently support SSL for API access.<p></p>
They are working to introduce SSL support in other APis as well as update existing client libraries and code samples to support SSL.<p></p>
Beginning September 15, 2011, Google will require that all users of Google Documents List API, Google Spreadsheets API, and Google Sites API use SSL connections for all API requests.<p></p>
SSL will further legitimize the integration of Google APIs into third party applications.<p></p>
As applications become more distributed, SSL will become a must have layer to all APIs.

Even though the <a title="OAuth 2.0 Specification" href="http://wiki.oauth.net/w/page/25236487/OAuth-2">OAuth 2.0 specification</a> isn't 100% finalized, Google has overhauled all of their APIs in Google Code to support it.<p></p>
OAuth 2.0 is much easier for developers to implement, and simplifies OAuth consent for application users.<p></p>
Google's support for OAuth 2.0 is a big boost for developers integrating with their API, as well as big vote of support for the future of OAuth 2.0 as the standard for API authentication.<p></p>
You can find documentation for <a title="Oauth 2.0 for Google APIs" href="http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OAuth2.html">OAuth 2.0 underAuthentication and Authorization for Google APIs</a>.<p></p>

        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />In March, 2006&nbsp;<a title="Amazon Launched New Web Service" href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2006/03/13/announcing-amazon-s3---simple-storage-service/">Amazon launched a new web service</a>, something completely different from the&nbsp;<a title="Amazon Bookseller and E-Commerce" href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon bookseller and e-commerce</a>&nbsp;site we've come to know. This was a new endeavor for Amazon: a storage web service called&nbsp;<a title="Amazon S3" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Amazon S3" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>&nbsp;provides a simple interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives developers access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites.</p>
<p>Amazon S3 or Simple Storage Service was initially just an API. There was no Web interface or mobile app. It was just a RESTful API allowing PUT and GET requests with objects or files.</p>
<p>Developers using the Amazon S3 API were charged $0.15 a gigabyte per month for storing files in the cloud.</p>
<p>With this new type of API and billing model, Amazon ushered in a new type of computing we now know as cloud computing.</p>
<p>This also meant that APIs were no longer just for data or simple functionality. Now they could be used to deliver computing infrastructure.</p>

        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/instagram.PNG" alt="" width="250" align="right" />On October 6, 2010&nbsp;<a title="Instagram launched its photo-sharing IPhone application." href="http://instagr.am/blog/1/welcome-instagram">Instagram launched its photo-sharing iPhone application</a>.</p>
<p>Less than three months later, it had one million users.</p>
<p>Kevin Systrom the founder of&nbsp;<a title="Instagram" href="http://instagr.am/">Instagram</a>&nbsp;focused on delivering a powerful, but simple iPhone app that solved common problems with the quality of mobile photos and users' frustrations with sharing.</p>
<p>Immediately many users complained about the lack of central Instagram web site or an API, with Instragram remaining firm on focusing its energy on the core iPhone application.</p>
<p>In December a developer name Mislav Marohni? took it upon himself to reverse engineer how the iPhone app worked, and built his own&nbsp;<a title="Unofficial Instagram API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/12/15/the-full-featured-unpublished-instagram-api/">unofficial Instagram API.</a></p>
<p>By January&nbsp;<a title="Instagram shut down the rogue API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/01/12/instagram-shuts-down-third-party-developers-plans-official-api/">Instagram shut down the rogue API</a>&nbsp;and announced it was building one of its own.</p>
<p>Then in February of 2011,&nbsp;<a title="Instagram released the official API" href="http://instagr.am/blog/40/instagram-api">Instagram released the official API</a>&nbsp;for the photo platform.</p>
<p>Within days many&nbsp;<a title="Instagram Photo Applications" href="http://instagre.at/#/by/knorrstein/35938336">photo applications</a>, photo -sharing sites, and mashups built around the API started showing up.</p>
<p>Instagram became a viral iPhone app sensation, but quickly needed an API to realize its full potential.</p>

He's right.  The pace of <a title="API Development Skyrocketed in 2010" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/03/08/3000-web-apis/">API development skyrocketed in 2010</a>, and will continue in 2011.<p></p>
Brands that don't have an API will be left behind.<p></p>
When companies consider an API for their brand, they should start with the basics
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Product Information" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/09/brand-apis-starter-product-data/"><strong>Product Informatio</strong>n</a> - Core information about your products.</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Supporting Product Information" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/09/brand-api-starter-supporting-product-data/">Supporting Product Information</a></strong> - Additional supporting information about your products like documents, videos, reviews, etc.</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Location and Geo" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/09/brand-apis-starter-location-geo/">Location and Geo</a></strong> - Location of where to get your products.</li>
</ul>
With proper API terms and conditions, brand guidelines, and requiring all developers to register a company can monitor and protect the quality of their brand.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/start.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
By starting small, companies can get familiar with having an API and supporting the community that goes with it.<p></p>
I recommend engaging with an API service provider like <a href="http://www.mashery.com/">Mashery</a>, <a href="http://apigee.com/">Apigee</a> or <a href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a> when planning an API.<p></p>
If you have your own in-house developers and want to keep development internally I recommend taking a look at <a href="http://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a>.<p></p>
Brands have to start somewhere.  By starting with an API that serves up your core product data, you can take control of what information is available for your brand, while also learning more about building an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API Community</a>.<p></p>
Once you have a simple <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/api-technology-rest/">RESTful</a> API that provides product and location information, an API support area, and an awareness of what your developer community wants;  you can then start innovating more around your brand API.

With a functioning API and API area, a company can think about whats next?  More product data of course!<p></p>
There has to be more information about your products that you can make available?  Product documents, videos, reviews, testimonials, case studies and other news or information. What information do you provide on your web site?<p></p>
Provide any supporting product data you think might provide benefit to developers and their application users.<p></p>
The more information about your products you can provide, the more resources potential partners and developers will have to build rich web and mobile applications.

Provide quality, up to date information about who sells your products.   Provide as much detail as you can, names, addresses, specific products and even geographic coordinates.<p></p>
There are plenty of <a title="Geo and Mapping API" href="http://simplegeo.com/">geo and mapping API</a> resources to provide additional data that enriches your retail and wholesale store information.<p></p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Mar 2011</span>
        <img class="aligncenter" style="padding: 10px;" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/api-growth.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Congratulations to <a title="Programmable Web hits 3000th API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/03/08/3000-web-apis/">ProgrammableWeb for hitting the 3000th API</a> in their directory.<p></p>
The <a title="Programmable Web API Directory" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">ProgrammableWeb API directory </a>has seen some amazing growth:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>1,000 APIs: over 3 years</li>
	<li>2,000 APIs: less than 2 years</li>
	<li>3,000 APIs: about 9 months</li>
</ul>
Three other noteworthy trends, the ProgrammableWeb team notices:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>API as a Company</strong> - More companies launching just as API.</li>
	<li><strong>REST and JSON</strong> - Simplification of APIs through REST and JSON.</li>
	<li><strong>Internal Usage</strong> - More companies consuming their own APIs.</li>
</ul>
Some might say the recent explosive growth is part of a "bubble", but if you look at the numbers its been a long 11 year road since <a title="Saleforce Launches API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">Salesforce first launch their API in February of 2000</a>.<p></p>
This is just the beginning of the coming global <a title="API Economy" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/19/the-new-api-economy/">API economy</a>.<p></p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/google-api-explorer/">Google API Explorer</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">08 Mar 2011</span>
        Just days after Apigee made their <a title="Apigee API Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/apigee-api-console-is-now-free-for-everyone-to-use/">API explorer free and embeddable</a>, Google has <a title="Google API Explorer" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/03/introducing-google-apis-explorer.html">announced a new API Explorer</a>.<p></p>
The new Google API Explorer is an interactive interface for playing with Google APIs.<p></p>
<a title="Google API Explorer" href="https://code.google.com/apis/explorer/">Google API Explorer</a> currently supports:<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PidOKEWFRR8/TXE0FTOPL8I/AAAAAAAAAJA/zZlx-KoWeXw/s400/2011-03-04-google_apis_explorer.jpg"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PidOKEWFRR8/TXE0FTOPL8I/AAAAAAAAAJA/zZlx-KoWeXw/s400/2011-03-04-google_apis_explorer.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Google Buzz API</li>
	<li>Google Custom Search API</li>
	<li>Diacritize API</li>
	<li>Moderator API</li>
	<li>Shopping API</li>
	<li>Translate API</li>
	<li>URL Shortener API</li>
</ul>
The API Explorer interface provides public or private access to APIs, with the private access handling the necessary <a class="zem_slink" title="OAuth" rel="homepage" href="http://oauth.net">OAuth</a> authentication.<p></p>
By selecting an API you wish to explore, you can see all the available methods and parameters along with documentation. Just fill out the parameters for the method you want to try and click execute.  The Google Explorer composes the request, executes it, and displays the response.<p></p>
Google provides some real-life examples anyone can execute:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Expand a goog.gl URL" href="https://code.google.com/apis/explorer/#_s=urlshortener&amp;_v=v1&amp;_m=url.get&amp;shortUrl=http://goo.gl/jN3IJ">Expand a goo.gl URL</a> using the URL Shortener API</li>
	<li><a title="Translate a phrase to French" href="https://code.google.com/apis/explorer/#_s=translate&amp;_v=v2&amp;_m=translations.list&amp;q=APIs%20explorer%20is%20awesome!&amp;target=fr&amp;source=en">Translate a phrase to French</a> using the Translate API</li>
	<li><a title="List Personal Buzz Posts" href="List your personal Buzz posts">List your personal Buzz posts</a> using the Buzz API (requires private access)</li>
</ul>
The Google Explorer provides an quick access tool for developers to discover what APIs Google offers, and enables users to immediately start using.<p></p>
This type of discovery and instant visualization can be the difference between API adoption or choosing to go with an alternative.

<p>Guided by a computer-aided design program, a laser fuses together several layers of finely powdered metal, nylon or plastic.</p>
<p>The laser melts the powder, which solidifies according to a chosen pattern. Then more powder is added, melting and solidifying to add layer upon layer until the object is fully formed.</p>
<p>Its just a prototype of whats possible with current <a title="3D Printing and Manufacturing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing">3D printing and manufacturing technology</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://apigee.com/about/img/create_console_screen.png" alt="" align="right" />Apigee has <a title="API Console Release" href="http://blog.apigee.com/detail/apigee_to_go/">released its API Console as a free</a>, publicly available tool for use by any API provder.<p></p>
The <a title="API Console" href="http://apigee.com/about/products_togo.html">API Console</a> allows developers to view an API, authenticate with the API and begin making requests and seeing responses from an API.<p></p>
The new publicly available API console lets API owners create their own API console, skin it to match brand, and embed within any API area.<p></p>
The API console assists developers with authentication by handling <a class="zem_slink" title="OAuth" rel="homepage" href="http://oauth.net">OAuth</a> 1.0 and OAuth 2.0 access to APIs.<p></p>
Once authenticated, developers can begin exploring an API and making calls.  It allows developers to begin using an API and understanding how it works without any programming.<p></p>
This type of exploration is critical for API adoption.   If users can play with all aspects of an API, understand how it works, they can begin visualizing how they will integrate with the API.<p></p>
Apigee's API Console is a must-have building block for any API service provider.

        I have spent time reviewing <a title="100+ Most Popular APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?sort=mashups">100+ of the most popular APIs</a>.   I am trying to determine a common set of building blocks that are essential to API adoption.<p></p>
Here is a list of what I consider are the most common <a title="Building Blocks for API" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks.php">building blocks for API</a> areas:
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/building blocks.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">

	<li>Blog</li>
	<li>Forum</li>
	<li>FAQ</li>
	<li>Pricing</li>
	<li>Terms and Conditions</li>
</ul>
The most successful APIs also provide self-service developer tools:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Registration</li>
	<li>Application Registration</li>
</ul>
API pioneers like <a title="Ebay" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">Ebay</a>, <a title="Salesforce" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">Salesforce</a>, <a title="Flickr" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/02/09/history-of-apis-flickr-api/">Flickr</a>, and Google have established a common set of essential API building blocks through trial and error over the last decade.<p></p>
Other API providers can learn from this <a title="API History" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/02/10/history-of-apis-birth-through-social/">API history</a> and experience, and make sure they start with the essential API building blocks for sucess.

It started with web sites, the need for talented graphic designers who could also assemble some HTML to deliver static web sites.<p></p>

Then smart phones began making the Internet <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/">mobile</a> and pushing developers to start programming for platforms like <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/iphone/">IPhone</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/android/">Android</a>.<p></p>
The next phase:<strong><em> the API developer</em></strong>.<p></p>

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/elance/gears-code-samples.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />API code samples and software development kits (SDK) are among the most important tools for getting developers up and running with any API.<p></p>
Providing complete sets of code samples for every area of an API and in as many programming languages as you can is important to a developer's (and an API's) success.  With complete sets of code samples in a wide variety of programming languages an API has a greater chance of success in getting adoption amongst the wider developer community.<p></p>
Using existing freelance developer communities for developing API SDK and code samples is a great way to build your code libraries with minimum use of internal resources.  And in turn, by using Elance developers to build code samples, you've made another move towards establishing a pool of high quality, dependable developers that have experience with an API.

        <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2011</span>
        Every API owner wants to ensure she or he has high quality, professional developers to refer to partners when building applications that use their API.  It can take years to cultivate an organic community of high quality developers for an API area.<p></p>
Freelance developer communities like Elance have existing developers and provide existing tools for:
<ul class="mainlist"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/elance/elance-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />&nbsp;
	<li><strong>Defining Skills -</strong> Establishing common development skillsets that are needed for API integration.</li>
	<li><strong>Skills Acreditation -</strong> Self assessment, skills testing, and acreditation around a specific API.</li>
	<li><strong>Rating System - </strong>Establishing a rating system for developers to set levels of expected quality around API development.</li>
	<li><strong>Job History - </strong>Show job history for API developer, establishing a professional history of API developoment.</li>
	<li><strong>Feedback System - </strong>Provide a feedback systems for API partners and other businesses to comment on developers API integration work.</li>
</ul>
As an API owner how you spend your time and resources is critical.  Time can be better spent in other areas, rather than building out developer profile systems and other developer tools.<p></p>
Companies like Elance have the existing communities of developers as well as tools for identifying the quality, professional and dependable API developer, and companies should leverage the power of these existing communities whenever possible.

        <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2011</span>
        One way to make sure your API has qualified and reputable developers from day one is to tap into an existing freelance developer community.<p></p>
Popular freelance sites like Elance provide existing communities of developers with the skills an API owner or partner is looking for.<p></p>
Elance provides access to their developer communities via a RESTful API.<p></p>
Using the Elance API, I have built a plug and play API developer community.<p></p>
My API Evangelist, <a title="Elance API Developer Community" href="http://elance.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">API Developer Community </a>prototype provides an example of what is possible when tapping into existing developer communities to satisfy the development needs of a new API community.<p></p>
My API developer community provides the following tools:<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/elance/elance-api-developer-area-screenshot.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Browse Developers (by tag) </strong>- Allows users to browse developers by categories (tags) that are predefined.  Settings to allow API owner to only display the type of developers, skills and tags that are relevant.</li>
	<li><strong>All Developers Listing -</strong> Provides a paged results of all developers for an API area.</li>
	<li><strong>Search Developer (by Name, Details, Tag) -</strong> A single keyword search textbox that provides a search results of Elance Providers.</li>
	<li><strong>Developer Detail / Profile Page -</strong> Displays a single user profile page with selected fields by API owner.</li>
	<li><strong>Featured Developer (Single Widget) -</strong> Displays a single random and/or highest rated developer profile.</li>
</ul>
The goal of my <a title="Elance API Developer Community" href="http://elance.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">developer community powered by Elance</a> is to show what is possible when integrating an API community with other freelance developer communities like Elance.<p></p>
The plug and play API developer community is written in PHP, uses the <a title="Elance API" href="http://www.elance.com/p/api" target="_blank">Elance API</a> for all of its data, and will be available on Github shortly.

        <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-tag-cloud.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />One of the goals of any API is to catch the attention of developers and become a tool they depend on and integrate regularly into their applications.<p></p>
If you build an API and release it into the wild -- even if it's high quality -- there are no guarantees the developers will immediately come.<p></p>
Even the big players like <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/">Google</a> have to build awareness and resources around their APIs before they can hit a critical mass of developers and be on the road to success.<p></p>
Developer presence and activity is critical in attracting new developers and partners to an API.<p></p>
Partners want to see that there are qualified, highly skilled and reputable developers available who can work on a particular API before they'll consider integrating that API into their own systems.<p></p>
For their part, developers want to see there are others to learn from and others who are actively using an API before they'll commit to integrating their software with an API.<p></p>
So, how will you attract developers to your API?

        Integrating with APIs requires a wide variety of skills.  Depending on the technology an API uses, integration may require knowledge of OAuth, REST, SOAP, XML, JSON, and mobile platforms.<p></p>
Each API has its own unique requirements for mastering it and efficiently integrating it with other systems.
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/elance/test-taking.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
Any company wants the best developers to work on their projects, but how do you verify that developers are reliable and truly understand an API and its intricacies?<p></p>
To ensure a developer understands an API, the API should establish a certification process for all developers to participate in.   Many enterprise organizations are looking for ways to have developers certified.<p></p>
<a title="Elance" href="http://www.elance.com">Elance</a> provides services for building <a title="Skills Tests" href="http://www.elance.com/p/skilltests/all.html">skills test and accreditation programs</a> around API communities.  <a title="Elance API" href="http://www.elance.com/p/api">Elance API</a> skills assessments can prove that a developer truly posseses the skills necessary to integrate with a specific API.<p></p>
API owners can build a custom set of questions that walks developers through any aspect of an API thatl are critical for integration
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/elance/elance-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
Developers can then take the self-assessment skills test to certify their knowledge and understanding of an API.<p></p>
API owners, partners and other businesses can use API developer certification to make decisions around which developers they will use on their projects.<p></p>
API developer accreditation will continue to grow in importance as APIs continue to become a ubiquitous presence in business.

        Taking an API from area to community takes a lot of work.   It just doesn't happen overnight.  It takes a perfect balance of technology, developers, partners, resources and hard work.
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/ecosystem.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
APIs are a big part of the future of a distributed workforce, and developer communities like <a title="Elance" href="http://www.elance.com">Elance</a> are building the workforce to support the APIs.  You can leverage the Elance platform to:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Providing High Quality, Professional Developers</li>
	<li>Develop API SDK and Code Samples</li>
	<li>Develop API skills test and accreditation</li>
</ul>
I have developed this prototype <a title="API developer area" href="http://elance.apievangelist.com/">API developer area</a>, driven by the Elance community to show what is possible using the <a title="Elance API" href="http://www.elance.com/p/api">Elance API.</a><p></p>
Using the power of the existing API developer community at <a title="Elance" href="http://www.elance.com">Elance</a> you can quickly take your API beyond community and build a living <a title="API Ecosystem" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem.php">API ecosystem</a>.

        <span class="post-date">23 Feb 2011</span>
        <a href="http://www.superfeedr.com/" target="_blank">Superfeedr</a> is now supporting <a href=" http://disqus.com/forums/superfeedr-thoughts/superfeedr_pubsubhubbub_for_apis/trackback/" target="_blank">PubSubHubbub for data APIs</a>.  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">PubSubHubbub</a> was initially created for <a class="zem_slink" title="XML" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> to alleviate the number of times a feed is polled versus how many times it actually has an update.
<a href="http://www.superfeedr.com/" target="_blank">
<img style="paddng: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Superfeedr.png" alt="" align="right" /></a> The bandwidth consumption and server load of an API can be reduced greatly by adding a PubSubHubbub layer on a data API.<p></p>
Primary areas of a Superfeedr PubSubHubbub deployment are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Resource Identification </strong>- Identify what services your developers / applications are polling the most.  Identify how many requests are made against how many times information was returned.</li>
	<li><strong>Push Discovery -</strong> Indication to any applications polling your API that the content being polled is available in a push fashion by adding an HTTP header to the API responses which mentions the Superfeedr hub.</li>
	<li><strong>Secure Subscriptions - </strong>Define a subscription callback URL where Superfeedr will echo all subscriptions to the API content, including the <a class="zem_slink" title="List of HTTP header fields" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">HTTP headers</a> and any additional parameter provided by the subscriber.</li>
	<li><strong>Notifications -</strong> Superfeedr needs to know when content is updated so they can notify users.  This is done in two ways:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Fat pings -</strong> An API owner can push content to Superfeeder and they will parse the content and push it forward to subscribers.</li>
	<li><strong>Light pings -</strong> Provide URL that has been updated and Superfeedr will update poll and update users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Superfeedr PubSubHubbub is providing a layer to existing data APIs that will alleviate bandwidth and server load.<p></p>
We are seeing similar layers being built for functional APIs such as the XMPP print jobs notification for the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/docs/proxyinterfaces.html" target="_blank">Google Cloud Print (GCP) Services Interface</a>.

<p>At the request of the museum, a team of <a href="http://i.materialise.com/blog/entry/3d-printing-rodins-thinker" target="_blank">3D printers at Materialise, took 3D scans of the damaged statue</a> to assist in repairs.</p>
<p>Using of of their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/imaterialise#p/u/3/ygHVVKkJWlI" target="_blank">Materialize 3D printing machines</a>, the largest 3D printer in the world, they created a mold that was used to restore the statue.</p>
<p>An interesting example of how 3D printing is not just for creating new works, it can repair historic artifacts as well.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Feb 2011</span>
        <a href="http://oauth.net/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/OAuth.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a><a href="http://oauth.net/" target="_blank">OAuth</a> is an open protocol to allow secure <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> authorization for web applications, desktop applications, <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/">mobile</a> phones, and other devices.<p></p>
When OAuth is implemented for an API, it provides benefits for potentially three types of users involved:
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>API Owners - </strong>Allows web application and API owners publish <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/data-20/">data</a> in a standardized and protected way.</li>
	<li><strong>Web Application Users - </strong>Allow users of web applications to open access to their data and resources in a secure way.</li>
	<li><strong>Developers </strong>- Provides developers with a standard method for building applications that integrate with APIs.</li>
</ol>
Virtually any application resource can be shared via an API, including photos, product, location or user information.   OAuth can issue access tokens for each individual resource area.  OAuth tokens can be unique per developer and for each API service they access, and provide granular security for all API services areas.<p></p>
<a href="http://oauth.net/2/" target="_blank">OAuth 2.0</a> is the current implementation and is not backward compatible with OAuth 1.0.   OAuth is widely considered the industry standard for API Authentication.

        <span class="post-date">13 Feb 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/basic-auth.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Basic Auth is a way for a web browser or application to provide credentials in the form of a username and password.<p></p>
Because Basic Auth is integrated into <a class="zem_slink" title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP protocol</a> it is the easiest way for users to authenticate with a <a class="zem_slink" title="Representational State Transfer" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">RESTful API</a>.<p></p>
Basic Auth is easily integrated, however if <a class="zem_slink" title="Transport Layer Security" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">SSL</a> is not used, the username and password are passed in plain text and can be easily intercepted on the open Internet.<p></p>
OAuth is a much better choice for RESTful API authentication, but Basic Auth is perfectly suited for APIs that are intended for a wider audience and do not give access to sensitive information.

        <span class="post-date">10 Feb 2011</span>
        As mobile phone adoption and usage continues to grow we are seeing a parallel growth in APIs to support the mobile browsing market.<p></p>
Many API providers are seeing the majority of calls coming from mobile phones vs. web or desktop clients.<p></p>
Another unnoticed area of mobile API growth is from mobile carriers themselves.  Verizon, Sprint, and AT&amp;T all provide developer APIs.<p></p>
<a href="http://developer.verizon.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/telcos/verizon-wireless.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>The <a href="http://developer.verizon.com/" target="_blank">Verizon Developer Community</a> provides documentation, tools, support, resources and two API services:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Location API</strong> - Allows developers to create applications that use the subscriber's location as part of the delivery of their service.</li>
	<li><strong>Messaging API</strong> - Provides developers with a network based Messaging API service to offer interactive services to our customers using Mobile Originated (MO) andMobile Terminated (MT) messaging.</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://developer.sprint.com/site/global/home/p_home.jsp" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/telcos/sprint.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>The <a href="http://developer.sprint.com/site/global/home/p_home.jsp" target="_blank">Sprint Application Developer Program</a> provides documentation, tools, support and go to market resources as well as six API services:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Geofence</strong> - Provides virtual perimeter services.</li>
	<li><strong>Location</strong> - Provides API for determining the location of a Sprint CDMA Device that is opted in to a developer's account.</li>
	<li><strong>Messaging</strong> - Provides a series of network messaging services.</li>
	<li><strong>Presence</strong> - A service to determine if a device is present on the Sprint cdma network.</li>
	<li><strong>UserManagement </strong>- A series of services to allow for dynamic user management.</li>
	<li><strong>iDen Content Uploader </strong>- A service meant to upload applications to iDen devices.</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/telcos/att-logo.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/telcos/att-logo.jpg" alt="" width="135" align="right" /></a>The <a href="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/telcos/att-logo.jpg" target="_blank">AT&amp;T Developer Program</a> provides documentation, tools, support, resources, developer sandbox and seven API services:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>SMS</strong> - A GSM protocols that allows the exchange of short text messages between mobile phone devices.</li>
	<li><strong>MMS</strong> - Extends SMS capabilities to include multimedia content.</li>
	<li><strong><a class="zem_slink" title="Wireless Application Protocol" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol">WAP Push</a></strong> - A standard for application-layer network connectivity.</li>
	<li><strong>Terminal Location</strong> - Set of <a class="zem_slink" title="Location-based service" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location-based_service">Location-based Services</a> (LBS).</li>
	<li><strong>Device Capabilities</strong> - Services to identify the capabilities of an AT&amp;T subscriber's mobile device.</li>
	<li><strong>Synaptic Storage as a Service</strong> - Storage based cloud computing.</li>
	<li><strong>Synaptic Compute as a Service </strong>- Server based cloud computing.</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://developer.t-mobile.com/site/global/home/p_home.jsp" target="_blank">T-Mobile has a partner network</a> with platform specific SDKs and resources, but no visible APIs for developers.<p></p>
Mobile carriers see first hand, the growth and potential of the mobile Internet, it is logical for them to also identify that value of providing their own APIs for developers to build upon.<p></p>
Primary the Mobile Provider APIs are all focused around services like location and messaging, however AT&amp;T is already pushing into the cloud computing and storage space.<p></p>
You will see more mobile providers launching APIs and more services from the existing Mobile Provider APIs in the near future.

The API provides full Instapaper account access, but can only access web page bookmarks from paid-subscriber accounts.<p></p>
Those who haven't paid the $1/month fee for an Instapaper account will still be able to submit to Instapaper using the <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/api/simple" target="_blank">Instapaper Simple API</a>.<p></p>
The API uses oAuth 2.0 for authentication and provide a set of helper libraries to get going.<p></p>
Instapaper API services and endpoints are:<p></p>
<strong>Account / Authentication</strong>
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>/api/1/oauth/access_token</li>
	<li>/api/1/account/verify_credentials</li>

Instapaper has provided some insight on its blog regarding <a href="http://blog.instapaper.com/post/3208433429" target="_blank">why it chose to provide Full API access to data from paid accounts</a>.  It's a new and interesting perspective to the classic arguement of freemium versus paid accounts.<p></p>
The first application developed using the Full API is <a href="http://wp7wonders.wordpress.com/stacks-for-instapaper/" target="_blank">Stacks for Instapaper</a>, a Windows Phone 7 client. developed by Matthieu Guyonnet-Duluc.  More applications are sure to come.

        <img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/ebay/ebay-developer-program-history.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />We hear a lot of talk about companies that were pioneers in the API space.  In an ongoing series we want to try to document the story behind these pioneers, and we are calling it History of APIs.<p></p>
So far we've covered what we consider the early innovators of the modern web API:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/" target="_blank"><strong>Salesforce</strong></a> - February, 2000</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/" target="_blank">Ebay</a></strong> - November, 2000</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon E-Commerce</strong></a> - July, 2002</li>
</ul>
We call this the birth period of the modern API movement.  Salesforce, Ebay, and Amazon were the leaders of this movement and set the stage for the social period of the modern API movement.<p></p>
The social period had one clear pioneer:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/02/09/history-of-apis-flickr-api/" target="_blank"><strong>Flickr</strong></a> - February, 2004</li>
</ul>
Flickr was the clear leader in redefining what APIs could be used for, and establishing the <a class="zem_slink" title="Representational State Transfer" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">RESTful</a> movement with their dead simple API.<p></p>
The next major players in the social period were:
<img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/flickr/flickr-beta.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-twitter/" target="_blank"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> - September, 2006</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-facebook-development-platform/" target="_blank"><strong>Facebook</strong></a> - August, 2006</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/01/30/history-of-apis-google-maps-api/" target="_blank"><strong>Google Maps</strong></a> - June, 2006</li>
</ul>
There are definitely other players in the social API period, but <a href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> obviously have come out as the clear leaders.<p></p>
Google Maps definitely pushed the definition of what an API could do with their explosive mapping API that is the favorite of API mashups.<p></p>
We'll continue to define how API pioneers changed the way we see the web into the API period dominated by cloud computing.

        <a href="http://instagr.am/" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/instagram.PNG" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>The mobile photo sharing site <a href="http://instagr.am/blog/40/instagram-api" target="_blank">Instagram officially launched an API this evening</a>.<p></p>
This comes just under a month after the c<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/01/12/instagram-shuts-down-third-party-developers-plans-official-api/" target="_blank">ompany asked developers to stop using a rogue API</a> that was reverse engineered by an outside developer.<p></p>
<a href="http://instagr.am/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> is accepting signups for access to their new API at:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://instagr.am/developer/" target="_blank">http://instagr.am/developer/</a></li>
</ul>
Developers will be notified when they open up access.<p></p>
<a class="zem_slink" title="Kevin Systrom" rel="crunchbase" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/kevin-systrom">Kevin Systrom</a>, Instagram CEO says, That the first step to creating a lasting company is to work with the many talented developers out there in the world.<p></p>
Instagram addreses image security and reassures that users will retain full ownership and privacy controls over all images.<p></p>
The Instagram API merely allows talented developers to create really neat and useful apps for you to get more out of your images.

        <span class="post-date">08 Feb 2011</span>
        <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596000950"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/SOAP.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>SOAP, or <a class="zem_slink" title="SOAP" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">Simple Object Access Protocol</a>, is an XML-based protocol that allows applications to exchange information over the Internet using <a class="zem_slink" title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> or <a class="zem_slink" title="Remote procedure call" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">RPC</a>.<p></p>
SOAP uses Extensible Markup Language (XML) for its message format.  The SOAP Messaging Framework consists of:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Processing Model</strong> - Rules for processing a SOAP message</li>
	<li><strong>Extensibility Model</strong> - SOAP features and SOAP modules</li>
	<li><strong>Underlying Protocol Binding Framework</strong> - Rules for defining a binding to an underlying protocol that can be used for exchanging SOAP messages</li>
	<li><strong>Message Construct</strong> - Structure of a SOAP message</li>
</ul>
A SOAP message returning a users information might look like:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/817172.js?file=API%20-%20Tech%20-%20SOAP"></script>
SOAP was originally designed in 1998 as a Microsoft project and became a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/" target="_blank">W3C Recommendation</a> in June 2003.<p></p>
Even though SOAP has a long history with enterprise development, it has not seen the same adoption with the web 2.0 developer community, in no small part due to its complex and verbose nature.<p></p>
SOAP is far from dead, but in the new generation of web-based APIs, RESTful interfaces returning JSON are fast replacing the bulky SOAP interfaces that returns XML.

Making a regular showing at popular events both on and offline is critical to building the awareness and the trust of the development community.<p></p>
Speaking at major events is the best route to reach developers if you're targeting larger conferences, as exhibiting is not as rewarding as it once was.<p></p>
However, <a href="http://www.meetup.com" target="_blank">meetups</a> and hackathons are the future.<p></p>
Reaching the developer audience requires being able to step up to the bar with a pint of beer and being able to go the distance at hackathons.
<a href="http://razor.occams.info/blog/2009/12/14/gah09/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hackathon.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
Traditional marketing techniques are often tuned out by the new development crowd and having a presence, building trust and mingling with the community are key.<p></p>
Stay in tune with your local meetup and hackathon calendars.  And make your own schedule known.  Broadcast events you will be attending and make sure an <a href="http://blog.twilio.com/2011/02/twilio-on-the-road-in-january-pennapps-and-philly-startup-weekend.html" target="_blank">provide quality recaps of where you've been</a>.<p></p>
A healthy part of any evangelism is a good roadshow, so make sure to produce yours in a way that truly connects with your audience.

        <span class="post-date">06 Feb 2011</span>
        <div><p></p>
So you want to share some data-- perhaps out of the goodness of your heart, perhaps it makes you look good or perhaps you're required to do so.<p></p>
Whatever the case, sharing your data should be done in such a way so that the data is truly open and accessible.
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/share-data.jpg" alt="" align="right" />
<strong>First:</strong><p></p>
Putting data in a PDF does not really constitute opening and sharing your data!
<ul class="mainlist"></ul>
I don't care how much we all love (or hate) the PDF. PDF has a lot of good uses, but sharing data is not one of them. PDF is a <a class="zem_slink" title="Portable Document Format" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format">Portable Document Format</a> and is great for sharing documents, but it does'nt provide and structure for data. So if you take your data and publish it online in a PDF form you are not making your data open or accessible.<p></p>
<strong>Second:</strong><p></p>
Posting an Excel file to the Internet is a good step, if you speak Microsoftese, but it would be better to export it as CSV (<a class="zem_slink" title="Comma-separated values" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">Comma Separated Values</a>) or TSV (<a class="zem_slink" title="Delimiter-separated values" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values">Tab Separated Values</a>). This at least keeps your data structured and by putting it on the Internet your are opening it up.<p></p>
If you really want to think a little further ahead, you might consider importing your Excel spreadsheet as a <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/">Google</a> Doc. This will make it public, and will accomplish the same goals as<a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/publishing/">publishing</a> as Excel, CSV or TSV but you also have the added collaboration, sharing and <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> that comes with <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/google-docs/">Google Docs</a>.<p></p>
<strong>Third:</strong><p></p>
If you truly care about the openness and accessibility of your data, you will publish it using a <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/">Restful</a> API. Provide clear documentation on how use your API, and provide as many samples of code in as many different programming languages as you can.<p></p>
Take time to consider your goals in publishing your data to the web, and your intended audience. Make your data as open and accessible as you can.<p></p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2011</span>
        With the <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/01/03/api-growth-doubles-in-2010-social-and-mobile-are-trends/" target="_blank">increase growth in API usage in 2010</a>, and expected growth in 2011, the need for high availability <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">APIs</a> will increase.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/global-regional-api.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
One way to localize usage and increase API performance is to deploy region specific APIs.<p></p>
There are several ways to do this including <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/07/zeus-cloud-software/" target="_blank">global cloud load balancing</a>, but a more cost effective tool is <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/amazon/amazon-ec2/" target="_blank">Amazon EC2</a> Availability Zones.<p></p>
Using <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/amazon/amazon-ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> you could deploy region specific servers in the following regions:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>United States - West Coast</li>
	<li>United States - East Coast</li>
	<li>European Union (EU)</li>
	<li>Asia Pacific</li>
</ul>
Using 4 separate servers I can create separate regional APIs sub-domains:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>api.uswest.apievangelist.com</li>
	<li>api.useast.apievangelist.com</li>
	<li>api.eu.apievangelist.com</li>
	<li>api.asia.apievangelist.com</li>
</ul>
If API usage grows in one region or another, regional Amazon EC2 servers can be deployed into necessary Amazon Availability Zones.<p></p>
Something to consider when trying to scale your API and deliver high quality service on a budget.

        According to <a href="http://forrester.com/">Forrester Research</a>, the <a href="http://forrester.com/rb/Research/us_mobile_banking_forecast,_2010_to_2015/q/id/57446/t/2">U.S. mobile banking market has experienced rapid growth in the past three years</a>, more than doubling from 5% of online adults in 2007 to 12% in Q2 2010.
<a href="http://forrester.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/forrester-research-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a>
By 2015, Forrester predicts that one in five US adults will be using mobile banking. Forrester attributes this to the adoption of smart phones.<p></p>
I would say we are in the biggest growth period for financial and payment APIs since <a class="zem_slink" title="PayPal" rel="homepage" href="http://paypal.com">PayPal</a> launched its API in 2004.<p></p>
With this kind of growth in mobile banking, you can easily predict the need for high quality, secure, financial and payment related APIs.<p></p>
We will see a lot more growth, innovation and competition in the financial API space in next 4 years.

It is very similar to <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-json.php">JSON</a> (JavaScript Object Notation).</p>
<p>XML was originally designed to describe documents, but has be adapted to describe anything from contacts to <a class="zem_slink" title="Geographic data" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_data">geographic data</a>.</p>
<p>APIs use XML to describe information. A XML transmission describing me might look like:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/817107.js?file=API%20-%20Tech%20-%20XML"></script>
<p>XML is a markup language much like HTML and uses opening and closing tags to describe content.  It allows computers to tell the difference between my first name and last name, for example, or any other information that it describes.</p>
<p>XML has long been the standard for <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">Web Service</a> communication, however recently it has been losing ground to JSON because it is considered more bloated and less efficient to use.</p>
<p>As the popularity of <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-rest.php">REST</a> increases, JSON may continue as the preferred standard, but XML will still have a place with many older developers, because it was the original way for web services to communicate.</p>

<p>The API launch was just shy of 6 months after the&nbsp;<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/02/mapping-your-way.html" target="_blank">release of Google Maps as an application</a>, and was in direct response to the number of rogue applications developed that were hacking the application.&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-map-logo.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>Google Maps was immediately so popular that developers hacked the JavaScript interface and developed application such as<a href="http://www.http//googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/02/mapping-your-way.html" target="_blank">housingmaps.com</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.chicagocime.org">chicagocime.org</a>. The demand was so great for information on hacking Google Maps it spawned books such as&nbsp;<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596007034" target="_blank">Mapping Hacks</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596004477" target="_blank">Google Hacks</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a class="zem_slink" title="O'Reilly Media" rel="homepage" href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html" target="_blank">Google Maps API</a>&nbsp;started a trend of API mashups with its valuable location based data, with over 2000 mashups to date.</p>

        APIs are not just for exchanging of <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/data-20/">data</a>. They provide much needed functionality for developers and integrators.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/clock_gears.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
The functionality of an API can provide shipping costs as the <a href="http://fedex.com/us/developer/" target="_blank">Fedex API</a> does, or provide you with directions from San Francisco, CA to New York, NY as with the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html" target="_blank">Google Maps API</a>.<p></p>
Functional APIs can, as the name suggests, provide much needed functionality to users that might be very costly or impossible for them to implement on their own.<p></p>
If a developer wants to provide the location of a <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/">mobile</a> <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/application/">application</a> user, they need to be able to turn the latitude and longitude of the users position into a physical address, city, state and zip code. This would require creating a massive look-up table of latitude, longitude, and addresses. This wouldn't be impossible, but it would be very costly.<p></p>
Functional APIs can save developers time when building their applications by providing needed functionality immediately, cost effectively, and with functionality that would otherwise be impossible without an API.

        Sharing information and services with your partners is vital to your business.  With the complexities of businesses' systems and the security of firewalls, this exchange isn't always easy.<p></p>
Defining what resources you should make available to partners and actually making them available can be a costly and time-intensive endeavor.<p></p>
Establishing a definition of what you want to make available to partners can be easily translated into a plan for what services you will offer through your <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a>.
<img style="margin: 15px; border: 1px solid #000;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/human-robot-handshake.jpg" alt="" align="right" />
Using API standards such as <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-rest.php">REST</a> and providing API responses in common protocols like <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-xml.php">XML</a> and <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-json.php">JSON</a>, will make it possible for partners to easily work with your <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">APIs</a>, and increase the likelihood that they incorporate into their business operations.<p></p>
You rely on your relationships with your partners to make your business thrive, and often showcase these relationships to the public to emphasize the the strength of your business.   Your <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/09/why-a-tech-journalist-cares-about-your-api/">API Strategy</a> can take this even further.<p></p>
Your partners often will be the number one reason for launching an API, and the number of partners and quality of your partners will contribute to the image your API has with the public and within your developer community.<p></p>
The success of your partnerships via your API can be the difference between simply having an API and having a thriving <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem.php" target="_blank">API ecosystem</a>.

        <span class="post-date">30 Jan 2011</span>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer" target="_blank">REST or Representational State Transfer</a> is term that describes a specific approach to delivering an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> or <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">web service</a>.<p></p>
REST takes advantage of the same Internet mechanisms that are used to view regular web pages, therefore does not need any special servers or protocols to deliver or view REST <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">APIs</a>.
<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/restful_large.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
There are different opinions of what is truly REST compliant, and many developers have seem to agree that using existing <a class="zem_slink" title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> mechanisms for your API is considered <a class="zem_slink" title="Representational State Transfer" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">RESTful</a>, regardless of conforming 100% to REST.<p></p>
REST allows you to take data and functionality available on your web site and make these resources available through a web services, and then return <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-xml.php">XML</a> or <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-json.php">JSON</a> representations of these resources.<p></p>
The reduced complexity of REST makes it more efficient to use in development, and has made it the preferred choice of developers, application architects, and API owners.<p></p>
HTTP, the protocol we use to browse the web, has built in ways to transfer, describe and deliver content to humans.  It makes sense to take advantage of this existing infrastructure to deliver data and functionality between applications.

        A common reason for deploying an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> is to share data with users outside of your organization.<p></p>
You need to make information accessible to partners or general public, but in a way that's self-service so you can avoid emailing a spreadsheet every time someone asks for something.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/matrix-data-streaming-api.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
You do this with a data API.  Data <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">APIs</a> can:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Provide an list of names and addresses for your upcoming event.</li>
	<li>Deliver news to web sites and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/">mobile</a> phone in real-time.</li>
	<li>Deliver products such as books from Amazon.com to other smaller, specialty web sites just focusing on cookbooks.</li>
	<li>Delivers census data from the federal government about who lives in your state to your local unemployment office.</li>
</ul>
A data API is proving to be the easiest way to exchange information -- whether it's between businesses, between the government and the public, or between your Facebook profile and your mobile phone.<p></p>
Web, desktop, and mobile applications are all being developed to depend on data from various private and public APIs.  These data APIs are launched to satisfy our growing appetite for real-time information and updates on a daily basis.

It is very similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" target="_blank">XML (Extensible Markup Language)</a>.</p>
<p>APIs are are way for programs to communicate and since they don't have voices, they need a way to describe things.  APIs use JSON to describe information.</p>
<p>A JSON transmission describing me might look like:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/817134.js?file=API%20-%20Tech%20-%20JSON"></script>
<p>JSON uses brackets, quotes, colons and commas to separate data, and give the information meaningful structure.  It allows computers to tell the difference between my first name and last name or any other information that describes me.  The protocol sketched above is really just an approximation of what JSON does.  After all, it is meant for computers and not humans,</p>
<p>JSON has become one of the preferred methods for programmers to use for API communication.  It's a light weight, simple way to exchange data across the Internet while still maintaining the structure and meaning of that data.</p>

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-api.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" />An <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">Application Programming Interface</a> (API) is a way for websites, programs, and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/">mobile</a> applications to talk to each other.<p></p>
APIs allow access to information, provide functionality or control electronic gadgets.<p></p>
Companies develop APIs to allow partners and other developers access their information, services and hardware.<p></p>
APIs come in many shapes and size.   The most common type of <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> today is known as <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-rest.php">REST</a>.   REST works just like any other web site on the Internet.<p></p>
Whereas people interact with computers via programs, websites, and mobile applications, those programs, web sites, and mobile applications interact with each other via APIs.<p></p>
Every time you use your credit card, an API is used. When you visit a website, it often gets information and delivers its functionality through APIs, such as the latest articles from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">NY Times</a>.  Mobile apps on your phone use APIs.<p></p>
APIs are all around you.  You just don't see them.

        <span class="post-date">26 Jan 2011</span>
        Having a framework for managing your API code samples and libraries is essential to providing partners and developers with relevant, useful and functional code they can use to integrate with your API.
<a href="http://github.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>
First start by breaking down your code into relevant projects that address specific types of integration with your API.<p></p>
Within each project you can create an appropriate title and description and set some goals for the project.<p></p>
Then build your code samples that satisfy the project goals.   After organizing and documenting all code samples, publish them to:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)" target="_blank">GIT</a> - <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a></strong> is a git based repository service and social coding service.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion" target="_blank">SVN</a> - <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/" target="_blank">Google Project Hosting</a></strong> is an SVN or Subversion based repository service.  They also provider Mercurial repositories.</li>
</ul>
Both GitHub and Google Project Hosting provide methods for you to manage your code in two popular version control formats.  This will allow API developers and partners to quickly check out code repositories, stay current with updates, and even contribute back to your API code projects.
<a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-project-hosting/google-project-hosting.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>
Publishing your code to GitHub and Google Project hosting will also provide added marketing benefits to your API community, by extending its reach beyond your domain into existing popular social code communities and the open Internet.<p></p>
Make sure and spend time to choose the proper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license" target="_blank">open source licensing model</a> for your code projects.<p></p>
Now you have a solid process for managing all your API code that makes them accessible in popular developer communities, your <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> area, and widely available on the open Internet.

        <img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/ebay/ebay-developer-program-history.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />On November 20, 2000, eBay launched the <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/common/api/" target="_blank">eBay Application Program Interface</a> (API) , along with the <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/" target="_blank">eBay Developers Program</a>.<p></p>
The eBay API was originally rolled out to only a select number of licensed eBay partners and developers.<p></p>
As eBay stated:
<blockquote><em>"Our new API has tremendous potential to revolutionize the way people do business on eBay and increase the amount of business transacted on the site, by openly providing the tools that developers need to create applications based on eBay technology, we believe eBay will eventually be tightly woven into many existing sites as well as future e-commerce ventures."</em></blockquote>
The eBay API was a response to the growing number of applications that were already relying on its site either legitimately or illegitimately.<p></p>
The API aimed to standardize how applications integrated with eBay, and make it easier for partners and developers to build a business around the eBay ecosystem.<p></p>
eBay is considered the leading pioneer in the current era of web-based APIs and web services.

        <span class="post-date">20 Jan 2011</span>
        One of the aspects of my current job that I enjoy, is the transparent nature of my role. My job is to generate attention for <a href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> and the Mimeo Connect <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/cloud-computing/cloud-print/">Cloud Print</a> <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a>.<p></p>
Let me give you an example. In various roles I've had at companies as lead developer, director of technology, or just a developer I spend a lot of time researching new technologies.<p></p>
When I research new technologies I usually create some sort of overview document, a presentation and probably some sort of sample code or prototype.
<img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/transparency-jellyfish.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
In legacy positions I do all this hard work, and usually submit to my boss and maybe do apresentationto other teams. Often times, my work goes nowhere.<p></p>
In my new role as an API Evangelist I enjoy a lot of transparency. I get to talk about my work as I'm learning. For exmple I wrote these blog posts yesterday:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/01/programming-with-pdfs/" target="_blank"><strong>Programming with PDFs</strong></a> - I am building a list of APIs and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/open-source/">Open Source</a> PDF tools I want to use, integrate and create resources for my developers.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/01/programming-with-images-using-imagemagick/" target="_blank"><strong>Programming with Images Using ImageMagick</strong></a> - Similar to PDFs I want a full suite of tools and resources for empower developers to program using images.</li>
</ul>
My project work involves me doing a lot of research and testing, and I get to share this information in real-time. If the projects move forward I will blog about improvements as they happen. So my documentation and presentations often go public as I create them.<p></p>
If a project doesn't go anywhere, the information is still out there. It is still on my blog and on my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/twitter/">Twitter</a> account. This can bring added SEO benefit to all my projects and help me in the future, you never know when it will come back around.<p></p>
In other roles where I don't enjoy the same transparency this information would never see the light of day.

        <span class="post-date">19 Jan 2011</span>
        Those of us in the tech community who work with APIs talk a lot about the API economy.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/financial/stock-market-display.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
This refers to how the Internet is changing all industries on a global scale, and how APIs are a driving force behind this.<p></p>
Behind the scenes, APIs are an integral part of:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Social Networking and Media - APIs were the driving mechanism behind <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/twitter/">Twitter</a> and Facebook's community and made YouTube a ubiquitous video presence across the Internet.</li>
	<li>Cloud Computing -  <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/amazon/amazon-web-services/">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> a leader in cloud computing started as ONLY an API.</li>
</ul>
APIs help enable the current smart phone revolution we're seeing with <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/iphone/">IPhone</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/ipad/">IPad</a>, and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/android/">Android</a>.<p></p>
These API-powered movements are significant in our everyday lives and how we conduct business.   Even though the term API economy applies in these contexts, it rings even louder when it comes the actual financial markets.<p></p>
With the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1914724,00.html" target="_blank">growing dominance of high frequency trading</a>, APIs such as <a href="http://www.tdameritrade.com/tradingtools/partnertools/api_dev.html" target="_blank">TD Ameritrade API</a> truly signal the beginning of a new API economy.
<img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/financial/td-ameritrade-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
These APIs provide programmatic control over:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Trading</li>
	<li>Real-Time Streaming data</li>
	<li>Historical Market Data</li>
</ul>
Cloud computing power like <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/amazon/amazon-ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> combined with financial APIs provide a way to make decisions and trade based upon real-time market data in extremely high volume and make decisions within fractions of a second.<p></p>
The power cloud computing, social networking, mobile phones combined with APIs are truly ushering in a new API driven economy.

Your API registration needs to be simple and self-service. <a href="http://openid.net" target="_blank">OpenID</a> is one way to do this.<p></p>
<a href="http://stackapps.com">StackApps</a>, the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> API demonstrates this perfectly.<p></p>
I wanted to see what was possible using the Stack Apps API. My objective is to integrate an API FAQ system with a Stack Overflow site.<p></p>
I went to Stack Apps and clicked on registration. Stack Apps only gives OpenID for registration. They allow you to select from top providers like <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/facebook/">Facebook</a> or use your own OpenID provider.<p></p>
With two clicks I was registered for a Stack Apps developer account, and with one more click I was registering my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/application/">Application</a> and getting my keys.<p></p>
This is how easy you want to make it for developers to get up and going developing against your API. OpenID is the solution.

        <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2011</span>
        Marketing products and services to developers can be difficult.   They are unlike other consumers and often are difficult to reach and build trust with.
<a href="https://github.com/"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
Recently, I was discussing which group within a company is most likely to initiate a plan for exposing an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a>: development, IT, Product Development, or some other? And once released who should own the API?<p></p>
I advocate that all departments should have a stake in the API, and whoever owns it after release should have roots in development.  Not that the development or IT department should own it, but the person in charge should have a development or IT mindset, as well as business development, product development and sales and marketing.  This can be difficult to find.
<h2>Marketing with github</h2>
When marketing your API to developers you can't think like a regular marketer, you have to understand where developers are.  One such place is github, the social coding and repository site.
<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920010203"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://covers.oreilly.com/images/0636920010203/cat.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
O'Reilly Media recently identified github as an important marketing tool in the release of their book <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920010203" target="_blank">Mining the Social Web</a> by Matthew A. Russell.  <a href="http://oreilly.com/" target="_blank">O'Reilly</a> uses <a href="https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web">github as a repository of source code examples from Mining the Social Web</a>.<p></p>
Not only is github a excellent tool for managing the source code of examples for a book targeting developers, but it is also a great way to market the book to an existing, vibrant community of developers like github.<p></p>
When building your marketing strategy for your API community, make sure and consider how you can integrate github with your API code samples, SDKs, applications and developer community.

        <img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-url-shortner-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Google launched a much anticipated API for the Google URL shortener today as part of the <a href="http://code.google.com/labs/">Google Code Labs</a>.<p></p>
The Google URL Shortener at goo.gl is a service that takes long URLs and squeezes them into fewer characters to make a link that is easier to share, tweet, or email to friends.<p></p>
The Google URL Shortener API allows you to interact with the service via a RESTful interface, and returns JSON data structures.  Here is the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/urlshortener/overview.html">API Overview</a>, as well as the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/urlshortener/v1/getting_started.html">Getting Started Guide</a>.<p></p>
Google has added to its new API console allowing developers to explore and get familiar with the API interface quickly.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/01/10/image-management-in-the-cloud/">Image Management in the Cloud</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I am taking some time and writing down my image management strategy to share with <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com" target="_blank">Audrey</a>.  I have a specific process and set of tools I use to manage images I use across my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com" target="_blank">Kin Lane Blog</a>, <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist Blog</a> and my Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and other online properties.<p></p>
I store all my images centrally at <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/amazon/amazon-s3/">Amazon S3</a>.  This may not be an ideal solution for everyone, but it works for me.  Its a complete storage area for all my images, audio, video and other documents.<p></p>
I use a combination of <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon Console</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3247/" target="_blank">S3Fox for Firefox</a>, <a href="http://cyberduck.ch/" target="_blank">Cyberduck</a> and <a href="https://www.jungledisk.com/" target="_blank">Jungle Disk</a> to manage my Amazon S3 files.  No time to explain the madness, it just works.<p></p>
I have a central bucket at Amazon S3 for storing ALL images I need to support my public online properties.   I have set a bucket policy for this bucket enforcing that all objects within are automatically publicly available.  This saves me time in having to set the ACL for each object.<p></p>
When I have a screenshot or creative commons image that I have found that I need to use in my blog I download, crop, resize, download and rename.    Then I immediately upload to my Amazon S3 public bucket, and then copy the location to my clipboard.<p></p>
With the URL of the image on Amazon S3 I go back to Wordpress and paste the URL in my blog content as an image.<p></p>
Amazon S3 in conjunction with S3Fox, Cyberduck, Jungle Disk and this process allows me to store ALL images I need for my public work in a central location that I own.<p></p>
My Amazon Web Services account is the center of my cloud storage world.  It is important that I store all my vital files here.  In the future I know where to find them and won't lost any valuable images I've used in content I have created.

<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/"><strong>Bronze Plan</strong></a> - The Bronze Plan is meant for developers at $49.00 / month.</li>
	<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/"><strong>Platinum Plan</strong></a> - The Platinum Plan is meant for enterprise customers is 10% of AWS usage with a 15K monthly minimum.</li>
</ul>
In addition to the two new support plans AWS reduced the usage-based pricing for the Silver and gold plans by 50%.<p></p>
If  that wasn't enough, Amazon increased its responsiveness for normal  severity support cases from 24 business hours to 12 business hours, and  low severity cases from 48 to 24 hours.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem-building-blocks-detail.php?Building_Block_ID=202" target="_blank">Premium Support</a> is a must-have building block in this API economy. But as  AWS's new offerings makes clear, as this becomes a competitive space -  in terms of quality and pricing - offering premium support might be the  thing that makes the difference for customers.

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/quora-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Quora has exposed a <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-json.php" target="_blank">JSON</a>-based data API that allows users to access data about a currently logged-in user.<p></p>
To  request particular fields about the currently logged-in user, you can  add fields to a query string and append to  <a href="Quora Exposes JSON API" target="_blank">http://api.quora.com/api/logged_in_user</a>.<p></p>
Currently supported fields include:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Inbox</li>
	<li>Followers</li>
	<li>Following</li>
	<li>Notifs</li>
</ul>
Here is an example call:  <a href="http://api.quora.com/api/logged_in_user?fields=inbox,notifs">http://api.quora.com/api/logged_in_user?fields=inbox,notifs</a><p></p>
This will return Inbox and Notification related information for the authenticated user.<p></p>
This  is not a full-blown API release by Quora.  Quora engineer Edmond Lau  posted information on Quora about the API, stating that it is in its  alpha stage and is only meant to support existing <a href="http://www.quora.com/Is-anyone-working-on-a-Quora-Chrome-extension" target="_blank">Quora Chrome</a> and  <a href="http://www.quora.com/Is-anyone-working-on-a-Quora-Chrome-extension" target="_blank">Quora Firefox extensions</a>.<p></p>
Even  though it doesn't have all the supporting elements of an official API  release, the fact that the Q&amp;A startup has established <a href="http://api.quora.com/">api.quora.com</a> for its use, indicates that it plans to invest more energy around an official <a href="http://www.quora.com/Edmond-Lau/Quora-Extension-API" target="_blank">Quora API</a>.

        <span class="post-date">11 Dec 2010</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/Facebook-Developer.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Any building block you are using to deliver your API to developers, such as blog or forum should have metrics attached to it.  You should be collecting any data you can on activity in your API community and reporting on it.</p>
<p>I received a platform update from <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/439" target="_blank">Facebook developer community</a>, with the following stats:</p>
<p><a href="http://bugs.developers.facebook.net/" target="_blank">Bugzilla</a> activity for the past seven days:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>117 new bugs were reported</li>
<li>3 bugs were reproducible and accepted (after duplicates removed)</li>
<li>19 bugs were fixed (18 previously reported bugs and 1 new bug)</li>
<li>As of today, there are 4,032 open bugs in Bugzilla</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://forum.developers.facebook.net/" target="_blank">Developer Forum</a> activity for the past seven days:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>557 new topics were created</li>
<li>377 new topics received at least one reply in the past week</li>
<li>Of those, 152 were replied to by an admin</li>
<li>Of those, 187 were replied to by a moderator</li>
</ul>
<p>These are great examples of how to report on metrics that give good insights into the Facebook developer community.</p>
<p>Setting metrics, gathering data, and making sense of this data will make you more knowledgeable about your API community participants, and sharing these findings with your community will increase transparency and bring your community closer together.</p>
