{% include JB/setup %}<p>Over the last year Ive worked hard to standardize and automate as much of my monitoring of the API space as I can.The amount of information I was monitoring daily was getting overwhelming--I needed to scale what I do, so I created what I call my API Stack Ranking.The API Stack Ranking is not meant to be a top 25 list, it is meant to be a ranking that I can sort companies by each week, giving me a meaningful stack of companies, who are doing interesting things in the API space.Each week I publish my API Stack, but you can also see this influence on any of my research areas.Â If you go to API management or the Backend as a Service (BaaS) research projects, the providers are sorted by their ranking for the week.</p>
