        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/03/06/api-driven-voice-architecture/">API Driven Voice Architecture</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.zypr.net/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/zypr/zypr-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working through lists of APIs and API service providers who I&rsquo;ve rated pretty highly because of their work in the past, but red flags have gone up because I&rsquo;ve haven&rsquo;t seen a blog post, tweet or commit from them lately.  One of the service providers I&rsquo;m reviewing is <a title="Zypr" href="https://www.zypr.net/">Zypr</a>, which providers voice enabled architecture built on popular APIs.</p>
<p>Zypr fits in with my vision of where APIs are going, because Zypr is doing the same thing as aggregation, automation and other trending service providers, but the end goal is this use case is voice.  In Zyprs own words:</p>
<blockquote><em>Zypr aggregates proprietary 3rd party APIs, categorizes their functions, and then presents those functions through a single, normalized API. By aggregating and normalizing 3rd party APIs, Zypr creates a stable access point for devices and apps to access those services without concern for service and API changes.</em></blockquote>
<p>That sounds exactly like what <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> is doing, but with voice as the vehicle for making valuable API resources avilable on apps running via mobile phones, tablets and in our cars and homes.  I really like the Zypr graphic.  I will have to create a similar version to articulate some the API trends I&rsquo;m seeing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zypr.net/" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/zypr/zypr-voice-enabled.jpg" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I hope Zypr is just heads down, working hard on their platform.  According to my API stack rank, there aren&rsquo;t very many positive signals coming out of the platform:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Last Blog Post - 09/28/2012</li>
<li>Last Tweet - 01/30/2013</li>
<li>Last Commit - 10 months ago</li>
</ul>
<p>What Zypr is doing is important--I hope they have enough runway to make happen. &nbsp;If they need to cut corners, they shouldn't replicate the service or client adapter portion of their platform, they could just partner with an existing <a title="API aggregator" href="/trends/aggregation.php">API aggregators</a>&nbsp;like Singly for these layers, as well as <a title="API reciprocity" href="/trends/reciprocity.php">reciprocity providers</a> like Elastic.io or Foxweave to migrate and tranform data. &nbsp;In my opinion Zypr should focus on how their engine works, and partner and generate open source to build the rest.</p>
<p>Personally, I would like to see more competition in the space of API driven voice enabled architecture.  So far I haven&rsquo;t found any other players doing it at the same level as Zypr.  Let me know if you know of something. Siri is going to need some healthy competition.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="Amazon Mobile Ads API" href="https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/mobileads.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/amazon-mobile-app-distribution-logo.png" alt="" width="140" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It was interesting to see Amazon step up in the advertising game with the beta release of the <a title="Amazon Mobile Ads API" href="https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/mobileads.html" target="_blank">Amazon Mobile Ads API</a> this week.  I wouldn&rsquo;t want Amazon getting into my space, when it comes to any API resource, especially advertising.  On the other hand, one can say that the space needs disruption with the dominance of Google with their multiple offerings:</p>
<p><a title="Amazon Mobile Ads API" href="https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/mobileads.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/amazon-mobile-app-distribution-dollar-sign-cloud.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/ads/mobile/" target="_blank">Google Mobile</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/advertise/adwords" target="_blank">Google Adwords</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/advertise/dfa" target="_blank">DoubleClick</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/advertise/adexchange" target="_blank">DoubleClick Ad Exchange</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/ads/admob/">AdMob</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/" target="_blank">Adwords</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/creating_monetizable_applications" target="_blank">Youtube</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I think we can expect some intense competition when it comes to advertising and specifically around mobile advertising APIs--battling for your eyeballs on smart phones and tablets in 2013.</p>
<p>Another layer that will add to the competititiveness with advertising APIs is the fact that all three social media and networking giants have their own advertising APIs now as well:</p>
<p><a title="Amazon Mobile Ads API" href="https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/mobileads.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/amazon-mobile-app-distribution-people-devices.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/ads-api/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/programs/ads-api" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.linkedin.com/blog/linkedin-ads-unveils-new-api-program" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With Google and Amazon both having devices in the game (Android and Kindle), it will be interesting how they partner with Facebook, Twitter or Linkedin for the social layer, and where all of this leaves Apple.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget about the  me too category with <a href="http://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/search-advertising/bingads-api" target="_blank">Bing Advertising APIs</a> and <a href="http://advertisingcentral.yahoo.com/api/overview" target="_blank">Yahoo Advertising Central</a>, or the potentially over <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/02/21/112-advertising-apis-google-adsense-google-adwords-and-feedburner/" target="_blank">100 other advertising APIs available via ProgrammableWeb</a>.</p>
<p>Any way you look at it, 2013 will prove to be a very competitive landscape when it comes to web and mobile advertising, with so many heavyweight contenders with their own devices and API driven advertising platforms.  I think an advertising API roundup is in order, in the near future.</p>
<p>I just hope that we start thinking beyond advertising when it comes to APIs and the monetization of web and mobile apps in 2013.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/judging-gavel.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little behind in working through my list of new APIs to review.  So I&rsquo;m spending about 3 hours each day going through my list of new APIs accumulated from <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, Tweets, Bookmarks, Google Alerts and other ways I have for discovering new APIs.</p>
<p>After looking&nbsp;through a couple hundred APIs, I&nbsp;wanted to share some things that stand out, and make me feel someone really doesn't give a shit when they hit publish on their API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Your entire developer area is a PDF</li>
<li>Really long, incoherent URL for dev area</li>
<li>Dev area is just a page in your help directory</li>
<li>You put google ads on every page of your API documentation</li>
<li>No communication, support or contact information at all</li>
<li>Sign up form that pops up in my face as soon as page loads</li>
<li>Require an NDA before I register</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of things that make me give an API a C or D grade, which means you probably aren&rsquo;t on my radar. &nbsp;But then again if you don't have active blog or twitter or developers aren't talking about you, your API won't register on the radar even with a B grade.</p>
<p>With tools like <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a title="APIhub" href="http://apihub.com">APIHub</a> and <a title="Mashape" href="http://mashape.com">Mashape</a> out there, it isn&rsquo;t hard to hang your API in a professional way, with minimal amount of effort and resources.</p>
<p>After looking through hundreds of APIs I leave with the same feeling:  that there tons of good ideas out there, but 80% of them are just executed very poorly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking at new and innovative ways companies are building <a href="/2013/03/04/next-generation-of-api-driven-analytics-and-visualizations/">analytics and visualizations on top of APIs</a>, and one of the new tools I&rsquo;ve come across is <a href="http://impactstory.org/">ImpactStory</a>.  ImpactStory aggregates altmetrics:  diverse impacts from your articles, datasets, blog posts, and more.  But this post isn&rsquo;t about ImpactStory, I&rsquo;ll crunch what they do and write about in another post.</p>
<p><a href="http://impactstory.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/analytics/impactstory/impactstory-beta-feedback.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This post is about their usage of feedback, helpdesk, and knowledge base management tool&nbsp;<a title="UserVoice" href="https://www.uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a>, which is a service I always recommend to API owners looking to support different aspects of their API community.</p>
<p>ImpactStory simply has a &ldquo;<em>BETA - Send us Your Feedback</em>&rdquo; image in the top right corner of their site.  When you click on the logo, you are presented with a simple UserVoice form for submitting your ideas of where you think ImpactStory should take their platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://impactstory.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/analytics/impactstory/impactstory-beta-feedback-form.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I think this is a pretty dead simple way of soliciting feedback from your community. Involving your users in your roadmap planning can go a long way in building goodwill with them, and encouraging participation and innovation in other ways.</p>
<p>After I spend more time playing with <a href="http://impactstory.org/" target="_blank">ImpactStory</a>, I&rsquo;ll do another post on what else they are up to, but at first glance its a pretty interesting approach to developing tracking analytics, visualization and other embeddable goodness using APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/data-marketplaces/data-market-visualization.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been following the great coverage by Paul MIller over at Cloud Ave about whether <a href="http://www.cloudave.com/26791/is-infochimps-running-from-the-data-market-business/">Infochimps running from the Data Market business</a>, and <a href="http://www.cloudave.com/25863/discussing-data-markets-in-new-york-city/">Discussing Data Markets in New York City</a>.  He&rsquo;s touched on any interesting topic around the viability of data markets as a business, and the fate of several of the most high profile players in the space.</p>
<p>In 2011, when it comes to data API marketplaces and providers I tended to showcase players like <a href="http://factual.com">Factual</a>, <a href="http://kasabi.com">Kasabi</a>, <a href="http://datamarket.com/">DataMarket</a> and <a href="http://www.infochimps.com/">InfoChimps</a>.  In 2013, we&rsquo;ve watched Kasabi disappear, and the migration of InfoChimps from an open data market, to a enterprise data platform.  While Factual and Datamarket appear to be going strong.</p>
<p>I think this reflects a common, lack of imagination by Silicon Valley because they are so focused on making money, they miss the need to support critical aspects of industries, that are required to allow for the growth they want to see.</p>
<p>While I feel there is money to be made off data marketplaces, however right now I think it is critical that we invest in people standing up and exposing data, not just focusing on making money off this process at levels that VC&rsquo;s deem adequate.</p>
<p>I make the same argument with API providers, its not that there isn&rsquo;t money in standing up APIs, but we need to heavily invest in the education of potential API owners and the healthy standing up of APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be plenty of money down the road from APIs and data marketplaces, but by always looking at it through a Silicon Valley perspective, we are going to stifle the oxygen necessary for a truly healthy, vibrant space.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending time looking through the API service provider space, and <a href="/2013/03/01/api-deployment-as-a-service/">last week I noticed the big gap in there being API deployment services vs. API management services</a>.  This imbalance is due to a gold rush by heavily VC funded API service providers looking to capitalize on the enterprise looking to proxy their existing infrastructure with a new breed of API services.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/data-marketplaces/data-markets.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve argueed this with execs at <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">unamed&nbsp;API service provider companies</span></em>, on whether the next growth in APIs will be from new, API providers or from the enterprise.   I was told I&rsquo;m naive and it shows my inexperience that I think it will come from outside the enterprise.  While there will be money to be made off the enterprise evolving their existing infrastructure in this new way, in reality this is just a small evolution in business not anywhere near a revolution.  Where big change in business sectors and economies will occur is when companies, organizations and government who didn&rsquo;t jump on SOA bandwagon understand the value of opening up data, and making available via APIs in this new way.</p>
<p>To get here we have a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LOT</span></strong> of work to do.  We need education, tools and services available to get these companies, organizations and government up to speed, publishing data and standing up APIs.  Once this occurs, there will be plenty of money to be made in mobile, tablet, devices, analysis, visualations, curation, syndication and other areas you hear Silicon Valley tooting about.  But VC&rsquo;s are focused on the end goal, not necessarily how we get there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get to work making sure there are open source tools and content to help any company, organization or government group &nbsp;get their data marketplaces up and running.  Let&rsquo;s not focus on making a fortune from it now, let&rsquo;s just make sure it happens.  It&rsquo;s far to important to suffocate with short term visions of making profit.</p>

<p>API driven analytics and visualizations is one of the new areas&nbsp;of API usage I'm tracking on.   There are many &ldquo;big data&rdquo; platforms emerging these days, but I&rsquo;m looking for dead simple tools and services anyone can use to generate analytics and visualizations via APIs.</p>
<p>Think of <a href="/trends/reciprocity.php">reciprocity providers like IFTT, Zapier and Elastic.io</a>.  These new API driven service providers, make it easy to migrate data between cloud services, using a simple set of source API, triggers, actions and target APIs--with a dead simple icon and wizard based UI, allowing any user to put the platform to work.</p>
<p><a title="Ducksboard" href="http://ducksboard.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-analytics/ducksboard-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I want this approach for embeddable analytics, visualizations and other widgets that are easily generated via APIs. Last week I came across a new platform called <a href="http://ducksboard.com/">Ducksboard</a>, which allows you to easily generate some pretty sophisticated analytical widgets from common API sources.  The platform even comes with a marketplace where you can find other widgets.  The only problem is that Duckboards is meant to generate dashboards, and not really open and portable widgets. &nbsp;We'll keep an eye on this platform, see where it goes.</p>

<p><a title="Ducksboard" href="http://ducksboard.com/" target="_blank">Then last night I came across </a><a title="Keen IO" href="https://keen.io/" target="_blank">Keen IO</a>, an analytics Backend as a Service (BaaS) platform that lets developers build analytics features directly into their apps, from common API services.  Keen IO provides a pretty sophisticated workbench for building embeddable charts, metrics and other analytics or visualizations that you can render anywhere, using  iOS, Android, JavaScript, Ruby, Python and Java libraries they provide.</p>
<p>At first glance, this space can feel just like earlier waves of widget building platforms of the Web 1.0 &amp; 2.0 worlds.  But I think we hadn&rsquo;t reached critical mass, in the number of available API resources, as well as an awareness of APIs in general, in order to realize the true potential of widgets. I think we are getting closer in 2013.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m optistic that a new breed of API driven analytics and visualization tools will emerge making dead simple, icon based interfaces that allow anyone to generate useful widgets from valuable API resources and embed them anywhere on the open web or in private portals.</p>
<p>Are there any other similar platforms that I'm missing?</p>

<p>Hands on, interactive tools are proving to be the most useful way to learn about an API--empowering users to see it in action, and witness the value it delivers.  Many companies are doing this by providing API explorers, consoles, interactive documentation and other hands-on tools that allow you to see how any API actually functions and learn about the API in realtime.</p>
<p>One of the latest companies to do this is <a title="MMS API Provider" href="http://www.mogreet.com/">MMS API provider Mogreet</a>, which has stepped into the API explorer game with their own API tester allowing anyone to visually build an API call that sends multimedia messages, as well as take advantage of the 25 other methods available via the API platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mogreet.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mogreet/mogreet-api-tester.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The API tester is available for all users via the developer dashboard, providing a hands on way to learn about the Mogreet API, all available endpoints, understand which parameters are required or optional, experiment with alternatives and quickly make the calls and see the result, understanding the value and operations before you get to work coding around the API.</p>
<p>While I think using an <a href="http://apigee.com/docs/consoletogo/">API explorer like Apigee&rsquo;s</a> can provide value, but I also recommend rolling your own toolkits that might speak specifically to your target audience.  I think a standard API console or explorer can help developers understand the operations of an API, but I think the right GUI tool can help any user understand the potential your API offers.  Which might make the difference between an integration project getting funded or not, with decision makers properly understanding how your API can be put to use.</p>
<p>Nice work Mogreet team!</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apicultur/apicultur-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>How to structure pricing for an API is one of the top 5 questions I get from people who are currently planning their API strategy.  In my opinion, there is, and never will be a one size fits all API pricing strategy.  What you charge for your API resources should reflect their value and how they are accessed and used by your target consumers.</p>
<p>The Backend as a Service (BaaS) space is working hard to differentiate themselves in 2013 with <a title="baas pricing" href="/2013/02/07/which-baas-pricing-model-is-better/">different approaches to pricing of mobile backend resources</a>.  Amazon is still shaking up the API space with new services, pricing models and the price reduction of API resources at a dizzying pace.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of meeting the <a title="apicultur" href="https://store.apicultur.com/">Apicultur</a> team while in Paris for <a href="http://apidays.io">API Days</a>&nbsp;last October.  Apicultur is a linguistics API platform, that is pushing the boundaries of what is an API platform as well as how you price language API resources.</p>
<p>Apicultur recently shared some of the thinking behind the <a href="https://store.apicultur.com/site/pages/prices.jag" target="_blank">current version of their platform pricing</a>&nbsp;where they&nbsp;structure the price depending on three factors:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Complexity of the API</strong> - Some APIs perform a very simple task (like removing commas from a text) while others deal with more complex task (like extracting if the opinion expressed in a particular text is positive or negative)--the "bigger" the API, the pricier it gets</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong> - The max speed by default is one call per second. In order to get more calls per second, Apicultur ask for a prepayment that is discounted from the final price at the end of the month (i.e., is not an extra price, is just a prepayment as a commitment). In addition, there's a discount at the end of the month for users for those who get a speed  limit feature</li>
<li><strong>Support -&nbsp;</strong>The basic support offered is the community support. For more support, special fees are offered</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apicultur/apicultur-pricing.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>Apicultur feels that by keeping the everything priced at 10,000 API calls, keeps things easy to understand as well as being fair for small and large projects. &nbsp;Leaving the costs spread between the varying value of individual API endpoints, the speed at which you need API calls and for overall support.</p>
<p>Small projects can register for the free account, which gives you up 20&euro; a month in calls without requiring a credit card, allowing developers to try an API before giving personal information and committing. I find it very interesting they call it a free account, while still applying a price to the value users are getting.</p>
<p>Apicultur has put a lot of thought into how they structure their API pricing.  I think their approach can help other API providers think about the value each of their endpoints offer, as well as other areas you can monetize, delivering more of what your API consumers need, while also bringing in revenue to make sure your API initiative is successful.</p>

<p>I stumbled across the <a title="Twitter Counter API" href="http://twittercounter.com/pages/api">Twitter Counter API</a> in my monitoring for the <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a> this morning.  The Twitter Counter API allows you to retrieve key metrics on any Twitter account like username, url and avatar. &nbsp;All data you can get via the Twitter API, but with Twitter Counter API you get additional information like account growth statistics and ranking, that Twitter doesn't provide at all.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating that someone can build an API to augment an existing API, which is why I keep talking about it, I guess :) We are seeing a more standardized version of this with API aggregation providers like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and <a href="http://adigami.com">Adigami</a>, where they not only aggregate APIs from a variety of sources, they also build entirely new APIs based the added value that is created after they are brought together.</p>
<p>Thinking about if further, it would be cool if you could submit your API to be listed in your parent API providers API area.   Think of <a title="APIHub" href="http://apihub.com">APIhub</a> and <a title="Mashape" href="http://mashape.com">Mashape</a>, but every API area would have its own 3rd API marketplace.  API providers often allow 3rd party developers to submit code libraries and samples to be listed as resources, as well as applications for listing in an application showcase. So it makes sense to potetially allow for your developers to submit APIs for validation and publishing into a designated area.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we shouldn&rsquo;t exist as islands, we should be able to invite in other API resources built on top of our APIs, or that compliment our APIs.  We should also have terms of use and pricing models that invite others to take our API resources and deploy in other ecosystem, building the next wave of <a title="BaaS Providers" href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/baas.php">BaaS providers</a> that will be delivering specialized stacks of resources for developers to efficiently build mobile and web apps.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2013</span>
        <p><a title="I Want An API" href="http://iwantanapi.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-i-want-api.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I feel we have done a good job explaining what is an API, why people need APIs, and providing services to manage APIs, but we are falling short on delivering information, tools and services for deploying APIs.</p>
<p>First I want to acknowledge that many companies have established IT resources, in the form of technology talent, and internal systems they can put to use when deploying APIs.  This post isn&rsquo;t for you.  This is about individual problem owners looking to deploy APIs, who most likely have little or no access to traditional IT resources for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>You want to deploy an API, because you havplease some data, content or other resources you need to make accessible to partners or the public, allowing for integration into other systems or be used in the development of web or mobile applications or possibly even data analysis and visualizations.</p>
<h2>Machine Readable</h2>
<p>As much as I love APIs, I suggest everyone consider your overall objective behind launching an API.  You may not need an API, you may just need to make your information machine readable and available on the open Internet.  Technically, this isn&rsquo;t an API, but publishing your data or content in a machine readable format like XML or JSON can accomplish many of the same goals of an API, without the overhead of an API.</p>
<p>Many tools you use every day like Microsoft Office, Google Apps, Salesforce provide tools for publishing data and content in machine readable formats like CSV, XML or JSON, much like publishing or printing as a PDF.  Not everyone needs an API, but everyone needs to understand the how-to, and the benefits of making machine readable a default in all business, organization, government and even individual processes.</p>
<p>PDF made data and content portable, for humans. But a PDF does very little good for other machines, websites and mobile apps.  CSV, XML and JSON make data and content portable, while also making them machine readable.  Please consider this simple evolution, while planning your API.</p>
<p>Machine readable will go far to increase efficiencies, interoperability, transparency and innovation within many existing government, organizational and business operations.  By providing data, content and other resources in CSV, XML and JSON they can be easily used across mobile, web and data implementations.  However in other situations there will be a higher need for more advanced interaction with data and content in the form of querying, filtering, transformations as well as the need to secure resources, limiting who has access and to what scale.  This is where we start moving beyond just machine readable, and into a truly needing an API.</p>
<p>When it comes to API deployment I would put users into two distinct groups:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Technical</strong> - You have skills and resources to architect, design, develop and deploy infrastructure, code to meet your API needs</li>
<li><strong>Non-Technical</strong> - You do not have the resources to assemble and execute an API strategy, making a cloud service an optimal route</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs are about making critical assets and resources available to technical and non-technical groups. &nbsp;APIs are often about circumventing some of the ways technology bottlenecks can slow us down. &nbsp;It is important that there are not just a wealth of cloud services for non-technical folks to deploy APIs, but also a buffet of openly licensed, downloadable tools that anyone can put to use when deploying an API.</p>
<h2>Technical</h2>
<p>You have some technical resources and the know how (or willingness to learn), and you want an API.  Ideally there would be open source tools available for you to download and implement:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>CSV to API&nbsp;</li>
<li>Database to API</li>
<li>Developer Portal&nbsp;       
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Docs&nbsp;</li>
<li>Code&nbsp;</li>
<li>Support&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Registration</li>
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>Key Management&nbsp;</li>
<li>App Management</li>
<li>Billing</li>
</ul>
<p>These tools would allow you to assemble your own API strategy in the language and platform of your choice.  There should be educational materials helping you understand how to implement individually or collectively as a single platform.</p>
<h2>Non-Technical</h2>
<p>You do not have the technical resources or time to implement your own API Strategy.  You need a dead simple, software as a service implementation.  You can see examples of this with the latest breed of API service providers, <a href="http://emergentone.com">Emergent One</a>, <a title="API Spark" href="http://apispark.com/">API Spark</a>, and <a href="https://apiengine.io/">API Engine</a>.</p>
<p>We are just seeing this new breed of API service providers rise to meet the demand of not just API management, but now also API deployment.  Making API deployment accessible to anyone, not just developers or companies with necessary resources.  This will make the benefits of APIs accessible to the everyday problem owners, who often are restricted by IT bottlenecks or entire lack of IT resources.</p>
<p>Making data and content from a spreadsheet or existing database, machine readable by default or deployed as an API, allowing for more sophisticated interactions, should be as easy as deploying Wordpress for your blog.  You should be able to go to a service provider and get exactly the hosting, deployment and management options you desire, or you should be able to download and install on your own infrastructure, giving you the control you desire over storage, hosting and access.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m adding a new project area to API Evangelist called&nbsp;<a title="I Want An API" href="http://iwantanapi.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">I Want An API</a>, where I&rsquo;ll be working to help define this space, and bring together other people to assist in developing the resources and tools we will all need to easily launch an API.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/emergent-one/emergent-one-logo-horizontal.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are numerous companies, with existing IT infrastructure, who are looking to deploy APIs in 2013. These companies will be deploying APIs using their existing technology teams, or depending on one of the <a href="/serviceproviders/">17 API management service providers</a> available.</p>
<p>This market is ripe for the <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale's</a> of the world to provide valuable services to, but for many companies, organizations and government agencies who need to deploy APIs this year, API deployment will be about taking an existing database or multiple databases, and open them up to the public, partners, 3rd party developers or possibly just provide access to a remote department or branch of their company in the easiest way possible.</p>
<p>Not all companies will have the resources, or the need to deploy full blown API programs. &nbsp;They just need a dead simple database to API solution that will quickly expose their data over the web in a secure way.  Until recently this solution wasn&rsquo;t available in the cloud, but a new API service provider called <a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank">Emergent One</a> has stepped up to fill in the gap.</p>
<p>Emergent One is a cloud service that allows you to connect to your company's MySQL, PostgreSQL or Amazon RDS databases, then generate a REST API from your existing data stores.</p>
<p>Using Emergent One you can define a new API, connect to your database using an agent or direct connection, then define your API resources complete with meta data, sub-resources, in-line resources, fields and computed fields.  Pretty much all you will need to make a clean web API from a database.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/emergent-one/emergent-one-api-resources-from-database.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Once you have your API resources defined, Emergent One provides you with a developer portal around these APIs, and the ability to provide developer registration, then issue keys they can use to access your data--providing the openness you desire, while keeping things secure and within your control.</p>
<p>The developer portal is complete with documentation, explorer console and code libraries for iOS, Android and in Ruby.  Emergent One allows you to bind your own DNS to your endpoints, and also provide paid plans, complete with billing management.</p>
<p>Emergent One is a perfect service for any company looking to develop and manage APIs from your local databases.   The only thing I would say is missing is support tools, to help you interact with your developers after you launch your API. &nbsp;But I'm sure its coming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/17/api-management-platform-emergent-one-launches-free-tier/">happy to see the Emergent One platform has a freemium tier</a> giving you up to 5,000 API requests a month, a business tier for up to 2.5M requests a month, as well as an enterprise tier with sales support for all levels of needs. &nbsp;The freemium tier will be critical for businesses to play with, and get to know better.</p>
<p>The Emergent One admin needs a little polishing, it could use a more dashboard like feel for the home page, but overall the Emergent One team nails it!  Providing dead simple, yet robust API deployment from your MySQL, PostgreSQL and Amazon RDS databases, in a way that anyone can put to use.</p>
<p>If your company is looking to deploy and API using a database, and don&rsquo;t have the resources internally to make it happen, I definitely recommend taking a look at <a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank">Emergent One</a>.</p>

<p>I try to keep <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> a place where API newbies and API experts can both find what they are looking for.  To meet this demand I&rsquo;m constantly moving the site around, trying to uncover more information, in a logical way that speaks to everyone.</p>
<p>To change things up a little I moved a couple of the most important trends in APIs out of the <a title="trends" href="/trends/">trends section</a>, and put them on the right hand menu, making them accessible from any page.  There are four trends I think are important to how APIs are being used right now:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Aggregation</strong> - Merging various APIs together into not just meaningful new stacks of resources, but entirely new resources, as a result of merging</li>
<li><strong>BaaS</strong> - The promise of Backend as a Service is to bundle together resources developers need to build mobile apps more efficiently. &nbsp;Some providers are rolling their own stacks, while others are using a hybrid approach with wise use of 3rd party API resources</li>
<li><strong>Reciprocity</strong> - The integration, interoperability, automation and transformation of data between cloud services, in a way that respects the relationshiop between user and platform, that uses APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Realtime</strong> - A realtime flow of data and resources using APIs and web technologies, meeting the demand of the API economy.</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-api-trends.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" /></p>
<p>I feel these areas will represent a shift in how APIs are deployed and consumed to meet the growing demand for the data and resources driving web and mobile applications.  While the API should exist on its own, these areas represent an evolution in how APIs are bundled together into more meaningful stacks, new mashups of resources and providing the integration, interoperability, automation and real-time needs of  businesses in the API economy.</p>
<p>In addition to these four trends, I&rsquo;m looking at several other ways APIs are being used in new and potentially powerful ways:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Voice</strong> - With the ubiquitous nature of mobile devices, voice is the next generation of discovering and interacting with valuable API resources</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis</strong> - The era of "big data" is upon us, like it or not. &nbsp;APIs will provide the fuel for the analysis that occurs around the insane amounts of data coming online, but also being generated by new applications and devices</li>
<li><strong>Data Visualization</strong> - One fundamental aspect of the "big data" evolution is being able to visualize and communicate meaning derived from data, and keeping visualizations transparent and interactive using APIs is essential</li>
<li><strong>Syndication</strong> - We saw the power of skyndicattion using APIs with the Facebook Like and the Tweet button. &nbsp;APIs will continue to drive syndication and encourage collaboration on the open Internet in new ways</li>
</ul>
<p>These all represent some very important ways in which APIs are being applied across all business sectors.  All these trending areas are using APIs to deliver value to government, businesses and individuals, and if we are not careful we can focus only on the end value and forget about some of the important benefits of keeping open, accessible APIs that deliver the valuable resources needed. &nbsp;The open pipes will prove to be just as important as the end value in my opinion.</p>
<p>We will need to make sure the backends to the mobile phones and tablets our families are using stay open and transparent, delivering the value while respecting our privacy and security.  There needs to be transparency and open access around all analysis and visualizations used in &ldquo;big data&rdquo; decisions in the coming years.  Infographics and industry reports without open and transparent APIs behind them offer little value in the API economy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing which of these trends continue to grow in 2013, and which ones go away, or even morph into entirely new trends.  This is what I love about the API space, the unlimited opportunity for change and evolution.  Which is why I keep the conversation going.</p>

<p>APIs are all the rage, anyone should be able launch an API from CSV, Microsoft Excel, Google Spreadsheet or the common databases such as MySQL, PostGres, Amazon RDS, Microsoft SQL Server.  Right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching <a href="/serviceproviders/">API service providers</a> evolve for the last three years, helping companies be successful in managing their APIs.  But when you actually going through the list of service providers, looking for someone to help you deploy an API, there are very few options out of the box.</p>
<p>The list of API Players coming from the enterprise:</p>

<p>These enterprise players assume you will have existing infrastructure to publish web services, files and other message systems that they can connect with,  to deploy your new APIs that you will manage.</p>

<p>Are pretty much the same.  While they may provide how to <a href="/2013/02/03/deploy-and-manage-api-on-amazon-web-services-aws/">guides for deploying APIs on AWS</a>, like 3Scale, the deployment of API endpoint is still your responsiblity.  You need to have existing infrastructure that will do it, or find the REST framework of your choice--both requiring you have the appropriate talent and resources.</p>
<p>Next up you can, deploy one of the open source API solutions, to proxy and manage your APIs:</p>

<p>But again, you need the resources and know how to implement, and they are generally management tools, so you still need to &ldquo;launch&rdquo; your own API endpoint.</p>
<p>When you start looking at the next generation of API service providers like <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a>, you can really maximize the design, planning, documentation and deployment cycle, but you still need to code up your actual API.</p>
<p>After Apiary.io we start to get to the service providers who can deliver on my vision of APIs for the masses:</p>

<p>It seems like we are getting closer, albeit its not as easy as I think it should be. We need a variety of service providers and open source solutions in this space, so there are numerous, dead simple cloud options for API deployment.</p>
<p>Emergent One definitely was a pleasant surprise in my quest.  Their tool needs a little polish, but for deploying an API from a database like MySQL, Postgres or Amazon RDS, those guys nailed it.  It is the tool that I will be recommending when people ask me how to launch an API from their database. (story to come)</p>
<p>I'd like to see the Emergent One approach to a dead simple cloud service for going from Microsoft Excel, CSV and Google Spreadsheet.  Maybe there is, and I&rsquo;m missing it.  Something like CKAN as a Service.  I think there is some more research to be done on this.  Of the 3 data API providers I used to showcase:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 30px;" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">

<td align="center"><a href="http://kasabi.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/Kasabi-Logo.png" alt="" width="130" align="right" /></a></td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Only <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a> is still deliving in this space, bringing open data to municipal, state, and federal government.  Kasabi closed down and InfoChimps is focusing on the enterprise big data.   I don&rsquo;t think there is big VC money in the data API space, but it seems like there is still opportunity.</p>
<p>It seems backwards to me, but it seems from 2005-2010 we needed to define and prove there was API opportunity, and in 2011 and 2012 we defined the API management space, so in 2013 are we needing to better define the API deployment portion of our industry?</p>
<p>I will use Emergent One, APISpark, API Engine and Apify more, and do individual stories on them.  Then circle back around and see how I feel.</p>

<p>I spent time this week looking at 20, of what I&rsquo;m calling <a href="/trends/reciprocity.php">API reciprocity providers</a>, who are providing a new generation of what is historically known as ETL in the enterprise, to connect, transfer, transform and push data and content between the cloud services we are increasingly growing dependent on.</p>
<p>With more and more of our lives existing in the cloud and via mobile devices, the need to migrate data and content between services will only grow more urgent.  While ETL has all the necessary tools to accomplish the job, the cloud democratized IT resources, and the same will occur to ETL, making these tools accessible by the masses.</p>
<p>There are quite a few ETL solutions, but I feel there are 3 solutions that are starting to make a migration towards an easier to understand and implement vision of ETL:</p>

<p>These providers are more robust, and provide much of the classic ETL tools the enterprise is used to, but also have the new emphasis on API driven services.  But there are 10 new service providers I&rsquo;m calling reciprocity platforms, that demonstrate the potential with offering very simple tasks, triggers and actions that can provide interaction between two or more API services:</p>

<p>I consider reciprocity an evolution of ETL, because of three significant approaches:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - Simple, meaningful connections with transfer and tranformations that are meaningful to end users, not just a wide array of ETL building blocks an IT architect has to implement</li>
<li><strong>API</strong> - Reciprocity platforms expose meaningful connections users have the cloud services they depend on.  While you can still migrate from databases or file locations as with classic ETL, reciprocity platforms focus on APIs, while maintaining the value for end-users as well as the originating or target platforms</li>
<li><strong>Value</strong> - Reciprocity focus on not just transmitting data and content, but identifying the value of the payload itself and the relationships, and emotions in play between users and the platforms they depend on</li>
</ul>
<p>This new generation of ETL providers began the migration online with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a title="Yahoo Pipes" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Pipes</a></span>.  Which resonated with the alpha developers looking to harvest, migrate, merge, mashup and push data from RSS, XML, JSON and other popular API sources--except Yahoo lacked the simplicity necessary for wider audience appeal.</p>
<p>While I feel the 10 reciprocity providers isted above represent this new wave, there are six others incumbents trying to solve the same problem:</p>

<p>While studying the approach of these 20 reciprocity providers, it can be tough to identify a set of common identifiers to refer to the value created. &nbsp;Each provider has their own approach and potentially identifying terminology.  For my understanding, I wanted to try and establish a common way to describe how reciprocity providers are redefining ETL. &nbsp;While imperfect, it will give me a common language to use, while also being a constant work in progress.</p>
<p>For most reciprocity providers, it starts with some ecompassing wrapper in the form of an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">assembly</span> which describes the overall recipe, formula or wrapper that contains all the moving ETL parts.</p>
<p>Within this assembly, you can execute on workflows, usually in a single flow, but with some of the providers you can daisy chain together multiple (or endless) workflows to create a complex series of processes.</p>
<p>Each workflow has a defining trigger which determines the criteria that will start the workflow such as new RSS post or new tweet, and with each trigger comes a resulting action which is the target of the workflow, publishing the RSS post to a syndicated blog or adds the tweet to a Google Spreadsheet or Evernote, or any other combination of trigger and action a user desires.</p>
<p>Triggers and actions represent the emotional connections that are the underpinnings of ETL&rsquo;s evolution into a more meaningful, reciprocation of value that is emerging in the clouds.  These new providers are connecting to the classic lineup of ETL interfaces to get things done:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Files</li>
<li>Messaging</li>
<li>Web Service</li>
</ul>
<p>While also providing the opportunity for development of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">open connectors</span> to connect to any custom database, file, messages and web services.  But these connectors are not described in boring IT terms, they are wrapped in the emotion and meaning derived from the cloud service--which could have different meanings for different users. This is where one part of the promise of reciprocity comes into play, by empowering average problem owners and every day users to define and execute against these types of API driven agreements.</p>
<p>All of these actions, tasks, formulas, jobs or other types of process require the ability to plan, execute and audit the processes, with providers offering:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Scheduling</li>
<li>History / Logging</li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
</ul>
<p>With data being the lifeblood of much of these efforts, of course we will see &ldquo;big data&rdquo; specific tools as well:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Synchronization </li>
<li>Data Quality</li>
<li>Big Data</li>
<li>Analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>While many reciprocity providers are offering interoperability between two specific services, moving data and resource from point a to b, others are bringing in classic ETL transformations:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Reformat</li>
<li>Aggregate</li>
<li>Sort</li>
<li>Dedupe</li>
<li>Filter</li>
<li>Partition</li>
<li>Merge</li>
<li>Join</li>
<li>Split</li>
<li>Convert</li>
</ul>
<p>After the trigger and before the action, there is also an opportunity for other things to happen, with providers offering:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Push</li>
<li>Events</li>
</ul>
<p>During trigger, action or transformation there are plenty of opportunities for custom scripting and transofrmations, with several approaches to custom programming:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Custom Scripts</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Command Line</li>
<li>API</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases the reciprocity provider also provides a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">key value store</span> allowing the storage of user specified data extracted from trigger or action connections or during the transformation process.  Introducing a kind of memory store during the reciprocal cycle.</p>
<p>With the migration of critical resources, many of the leading providers are offering tools for testing the process before live execution:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Test</li>
<li>Debugger</li>
<li>Sandbox</li>
<li>Production</li>
</ul>
<p>With any number of tasks or jobs in motion, users will need to understand whether the whole apparatus is working, with platforms offering tools for:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
<li>Optimization</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are a couple providers offering completely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">open source</span> solutions, there are also several providing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">OEM</span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">white label solutions</span>, which allow you to deploy a reciprocity platform for your partners, clients or other situations that would require it to branded in a custom way.</p>
<p>One area that will continue to push ETL into this new category of reciprocity providers is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">security</span>.  Connectors will often use <span style="text-decoration: underline;">OAuth</span>, respecting a users already established relationship with platform either on the trigger or action sides, ensureing their existing relationship is upheld.  Beyond this providers are offering <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SSL</span> to provide secure transmissions, but in the near future we will see other layers emerge to keep agreements in tact, private and maintain the value of not just the payload but the relationships between platforms, users and reciprocity providers.</p>
<p>Even though reciprocity providers focus on the migration of resources in this new API driven, cloud-based world, several of them still offer dual solutions for deploying solutions in both environments:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Cloud </li>
<li>On-Premise</li>
</ul>
<p>There is not one approach either in the cloud, or on premise that will work for everyone and all their needs.  Some data will be perfectly find moving around the cloud, while others will require a more sensitive on-premise approach.  It will be up to problem owners to decide.</p>
<p>Many of this new breed of providers are in beta and pricing &nbsp;isn&rsquo;t available.  A handful have begun to apply cloud based pricing models, but most are still trying to understand the value of this new service and what market will bear.  So far I&rsquo;m seeing pricing based upon:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Seat</li>
<li>Assembly</li>
<li>Tasks</li>
<li>Connections</li>
<li>Extension</li>
<li>Sync</li>
<li>Support</li>
<li>Training</li>
</ul>
<p>Much like IaaS, PaaS SaaS and now BaaS, reciprocity providers will have a lot of education and communication with end users before they&rsquo;ll fully understand what they can charge for their services--forcing them to continue to define and differentiate themselves in 2013.</p>
<p>One of the most important evolutionary areas, I&rsquo;m only seeing with one or two providers, is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">marketplace</span> where reciprocity platform users can browse and search for assemblies, connectors and tasks that are created by 3rd party providers for specific reciprocity approaches.  A marketplace will prove to be how reciprocity platforms serve the long tail and niches that will exist within the next generation of ETL.  Marketplaces will provide a way for developers to build solutions that meet specific needs, allowing them to monetize their skills and domain expertise, while also bringing in revenue to platform owners.</p>
<p>I understand this is all a lot of information.  If you are still ready this, you most likely either already understand this space, or like me, feel it is an important area to understand and help educate people about.   Just like with API service providers and BaaS, I will continue to write about my research here, while providing more refined materials as Github repos for each research area.</p>
<p>Let me know anything I'm missing or your opinions on the concept of API reciprocity.</p>

<p>Making onboarding with an API as frictionless as possible is one thing I like to study and educate my readers about. While I was studying what I call the <a title="API reciprocity" href="/trends/reciprocity.php">API reciprocity</a> space currently, which is an evolution of what is known in the enterprise as ETL, I came across a company called FoxWeave.</p>
<p><a title="FoxWeave" href="http://www.foxweave.com/" target="_blank">FoxWeave</a> is a service that can migrate and synchronize data across all your cloud and on-premise apps and databases.  When I went to &ldquo;try it now&rdquo; at FoxWeave, I was told &ldquo;no signup needed&rdquo;.  But I didnt&rsquo; think much about it until I saw the temporary guest account popup.</p>

<p>What a powerful concept.  Evolving the freemium concept into the world of anonymity, allowing me to play with and understand your service before having to commit in any way.  One less piece of friction when I&rsquo;m trying to understad a new tool or service.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/respect-my-authority.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>There is a great post by Lorinda Brandon (<a href="https://twitter.com/lindybrandon">@lindybrandon</a>) of <a title="SmartBear" href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a> on ProgrammableWeb today called&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2013/02/27/governance-vs-innovation-do-they-have-to-be-enemies/">Governance vs Innovation: Do They Have to be Enemies?</a>. &nbsp;She continues a conversation, from <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> around the word "governance", and how in the API space, this is often considered a bad word. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I was moderating the questions for <span>Alistair Farquharson (</span><span lang="EN"><a href="https://twitter.com/afarqu">@</a></span><span lang="EN"><a href="https://twitter.com/afarqu">afarqu</a>)</span><span>&nbsp;CTO of&nbsp;</span><a title="SOA Software" href="http://www.soa.com/">SOA Software</a>, when&nbsp;<span>Irakli Nadareishvili (</span><a href="http://twitter.com/inadarei/" target="_blank">@inadarei</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a title="NPR" href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a> actually agreed that it is a bad word and asked if we need to evolve beyond it and not embrace it. &nbsp;I totally agree with Lorinda's approach to walking the line between governance and innovation, and look forward to more discussion around how to analyze API vs SOA principles within the enterprise--striking a balance that works for each individual approach.</p>
<p>To help stimulate this conversation I wanted to break down the word, governance. &nbsp;In the context of IT, governance is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>a concept used for activities related to exercising control over services in a service-oriented architecture (SOA). The definitions of SOA governance agree in its purpose of exercising control, but differ in the responsibilities it should have. Some narrow definitions focus on imposing policies and monitoring services, while other definitions use a broader business-oriented perspective</em></p>
<p>With general definitions being:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>the persons who make up a body for the purpose of administering something</li>
<li>the act of governing; exercising authority</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the illness around the word, when it is applied to APIs becomes clear when you start looking at the synonyms:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Governance</strong> - administration, authority, bureaucracy, command, control, direction, domination, dominion, empire, execution, executive, guidance, influence, jurisdiction, law, ministry, patronage, political practice, politics, polity, power, powers-that-be, predominanc</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong> - administration, care, charge, command, conduct, control, direction, governance , government, guidance, handling, intendance, manipulation, operation, oversight, rule, superintendence, superintendency, supervision</li>
<li><strong>Regulation</strong> - adjustment, administration, arrangement, classification, codification, control, coordination, direction, governance , governing, government, guidance, handling, management, moderation, modulation, reconciliation, regimentation, reorganization, settlement, standardization, superintendence, supervision, systematization, tuning</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's separate the potentially bad synonyms:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/governance-bad.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>administration</li>
<li>authority</li>
<li>bureaucracy</li>
<li>command</li>
<li>control</li>
<li>domination</li>
<li>dominion</li>
<li>empire</li>
<li>power</li>
<li>politics</li>
<li>control</li>
<li>government</li>
<li>manipulation</li>
<li>oversight</li>
<li>standardization</li>
</ul>
<p>And the good synonyms:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/governance-good.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>direction</li>
<li>execution</li>
<li>guidance</li>
<li>influence</li>
<li>care</li>
<li>operation</li>
<li>arrangement</li>
<li>coordination</li>
<li>standardization</li>
<li>tuning</li>
<li>modulation</li>
<li>power</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel both power and standardization could be both good or evil, so I put in both categories. &nbsp;But overall you can begin to understand how governance is viewed in negative light in the API approach. &nbsp;People see it more about power and control, rather than the healthy aspects introduced API innovation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In my opinion, this word reflects on why API works in more scenarios than strict SOA. &nbsp;Too much control can stifle innovation, and if you are controlling for all the wrong reasons, it can be even worse. &nbsp;APIs require a certain amount of oxygen to grow and evolve before it can achieve a level of innovation, which is an aspect some business leaders have trouble grasping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Irakli and I both agreed that we need a new word, something that reflects the bottom up of API, not the top down control of SOA. &nbsp;Any ideas for a word that can keep be applied in a healthy way, but can institute many of the positive aspects of governance, without the potential innovation killing power and control?</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/reciprocity.php"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/reciprocity-trends.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m wading through dictionaries and thesauruses in an effort to find a <a href="/2013/02/27/what-is-better-word-for-governance-when-it-comes-to-apis/">more appropriate term &ldquo;governance&rdquo;, when looking at SOA governance through the API lense</a>--I figured I&rsquo;d flush out another area I&rsquo;m working to define a term that appropriately describes automation and interoperability using APIs.</p>
<p>Yesterday I took a look at <a href="/2013/02/26/75-features-from-across-31-baas-providers/">31 backend as a service (BaaS) providers</a>, in hopes of understanding more about what value they provide.  Today I'm diving into the automation section of my new <a href="/trends/">API trends area</a>. While reviewing, I noticed the exact same companies that were under automation were also in interoperability.  So I set out to find a new word to apply to this next generation of ETL providers that are building bridges between cloud platforms using APIs, as well as legacy data connections.</p>
<p>I have settled on the word <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reciprocity</span>.  The dictionary defines reciprocity as:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>the quality or state of being reciprocal : mutual dependence, action, or influence</li>
<li>a mutual exchange of privileges; specifically : a recognition by one of two countries or institutions of the validity of licenses or privileges granted by the other</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/reciprocity.php"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/social-reciprocity.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When you look in the thesaurus, reciprocity has a definition of "interchange" with synonyms of cooperation, exchange, mutuality and reciprocation.  Reciprocity is also a synonym of connection with a definition of &ldquo;person who aids another in achieving goal&rdquo;. With synonyms being acquaintance, agent, ally, associate, association, contact, friend, go-between, intermediary, kin, kindred, kinship, mentor, messenger, network, reciprocity, relation, relative and sponsor. &nbsp;(i love that "kin" is a synonym too)</p>
<p>All of these terms apply to what I&rsquo;m seeing unfold with this new generation of ETL providers.  ETL is moving into the clouds, and out from behind the firewall, using the open web, cloud platforms and APIs, and now we have to <a href="/2013/02/10/bringing-etl-to-the-masses-with-apis/">rethink ETL, and make it accessible to the masses</a>. Put it within reach of the everday problem owners.</p>
<p>What I really like about reciprocity is it describes the mutual relationship between users and the platforms where their data and information resides.  Reciprocity describes the connection that has to occur between these valuable API platforms, and their users, in ways the ETL misses.  ETL stands for extract, transform and load, very technical and programmatic responses to moving my valuable resources, assets and personal information between the cloud platform I depend on daily.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/reciprocity.php"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/reciprocity-2.jpeg" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In the physical world we have reciprocity agreements between countries to ensure free trade and a healthy balance in world markets.  This next generation of reciprocity platform providers will not just be extracting, transforming and loading data--reciprocity platforms will be the nervous system of the global API economy, moving valuable resources around the world while respecting relationships between users, developers and the platforms in a way that preserves maximum value for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Now under the <a href="/trends/">trends section</a> you will just see one section for <a title="reciprocity" href="/trends/reciprocity.php">reciprocity</a>, that will house all 19 of this new breed of API service providers.  We&rsquo;ll see how things change, but for now I think reciprocity describes the value created by this new space, in a way that helps me communicate it to others.</p>

<p>We closed up the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sessions.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23apistrat&amp;src=typd">#APIstrat</a>) last friday with a panel called APIs, Platforms and Ecosystem, where I moderated a healthy discussion with Tyler Stalder (<a href="https://twitter.com/tylerstalder">@tylerstalder</a>)&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="Singly" href="http://www.singly.com/" target="_blank">Singly</a>,&nbsp;Seth Blank (<a href="https://twitter.com/AntiFreeze">@AntiFreeze</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="YourTrove" href="https://www.yourtrove.com/">YourTrove</a>,&nbsp;Asif Rahman (<a href="https://twitter.com/asifrahman">@asifrahman</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="NewsCred" href="http://newscred.com/">Newscred</a>, Orian Marx (<a href="http://alpha.app.net/orian">@orian</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="App.net" href="https://join.app.net/">App.net</a>,&nbsp;Travis Wallis (<a href="https://twitter.com/traviswallis" target="_blank">@traviswallis</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="PeopleBrowsr" href="http://peoplebrowsr.com/" target="_blank">PeopleBrowsr</a>&nbsp;around the very broad spectrum of APIs, platforms and the concept of ecosystems.</p>
<p>One of the questions I asked the group was, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">which of the three OAuth Legs is the most important?</span> &nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide a quick primer for the portion of my audience that aren&rsquo;t OAuth geeks:</p>
<blockquote><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth is an open standard for authorization that provides a method for clients to access server resources on behalf of a resource owner</a></em></blockquote>
<p>Ok, what does that mean?  Think Twitter.  Twitter is server.  You are the owner of your tweet resources.  When you authenticate anywhere using your Twitter ID, that website or app uses OAuth to get access to your tweets, via the Twitter platform.  If you login to your Twitter account, click on settings and select apps from the left menu--these are apps and sites that have requested OAuth access <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> Twitter resources.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/oauth/OAuth2.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></p>
<p>OAuth is a relationship between you, your platform provider and various sites and apps that want to access your data via the API.  Sometimes these apps and your platform provider are one and the same, but the beauty of OAuth&nbsp;is that anyone can request access from you--access that you can revoke when you choose.</p>
<p>Back to the panel at API Strategy &amp; Practice.  Every panelist, except for Asif Rahman of Newscred said that the most important leg of oAuth is the end user. This made me happy because it shows that, at least at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23apistrat&amp;src=typd">#APIstrat</a>, people are concerned with the interest of the end user.  This is healthy.</p>
<p>In reality, I worry that when platform discussions do occur, the conversation leans too much in favor of platform, then the developer, with very little to no involvement of the end user.  Think of the Twitter ecosystem discussions since March of 2010.  Rarely do you hear discussion about API access and ecosystem viability in the context of the end-users.  Platforms and especially developers are very good at being very loud in these conversations.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/oauth/oauth-twitter-3-legs.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>In my opinion all three legs of OAuth are equally important, with an emphasis on the end-user.  It is their resource right?  Or is it?  The only thing standing between healthy OAuth conversations and relationships is the platforms terms of use and privacy policies.</p>
<p>The entire panel at #APIStrat agreed that we need more education for end-users about OAuth.  Now that we have OAuth 2.0 settled (in some minds), we need to get down to business <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">educating all three legs</span></em>&nbsp;around the process of OAuth and its best practices, empowering all three parties to be aware, and participate in ongoing conversations about how we are producing, storing, sharing, selling, licensing and consuming resources via APIs.</p>
<p>We need to make sure API platform conversations have all three legs represented.  The success of any platform will depend on a healthy balance between a platform, developers and the end-users--with oAuth 2.0 being the best model we have to make this happen to date.</p>
<p>Lets get to work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer in the power of the freemium model when it comes to APIs.  Nothing is as it seems when you are deploying managing or consuming APIs.  You have to have room to innovate and iterate without signing contracts or paying too much, before you find exactly the right integration or deployment that works.</p>
<p>This freemium approach to APIs is one of the biggest reasons I&rsquo;ve been supporting <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a> since early days of API Evangelist.  3Scale was the original API service provider to offer a truly freemium tier for anyone wanting to deploy an API, and remains passionate about this to this day.</p>
<p>During the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in NYC</a> last week, I had the pleasure of meeting the <a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a> team, who share a similar perspective of the space, resulting in them launching a new suite of free tools that will help you develop, test and monitor while building API driven software.</p>

<p>The goal of the new freeware initiative is to put robust tools for quality software development into the hands of developers and testers immediately while allowing them to upgrade to the feature-rich paid versions when it makes practical sense.  I sat down with Lorinda Brandon, Director of Strategy, SmartBear Software while at #apistrat, where she said:</p>
<blockquote><em>The burgeoning API industry is a reflection of a new phase of innovation and collaboration in the software industry as a whole. Businesses and organizations are now sharing their data and functionality via APIs like never before, often for free. In fact, businesses are even inviting the developer community to come together in hackathons to build apps and mashups using their APIs. While we applaud the energy and pace, we also want to keep the focus on building high quality products. In 2013, SmartBear wants to empower this collaborative global community of developers to create high-quality, low-cost (or free) offerings of their own by making even more of our tools available for free through our Freeware Initiative.</em></blockquote>
<p>I agree 100%.  Freemium can be a critical marketing vehicle in the API industry, one that will bring attention to your tools and services, while also providing room for your customers to put tools to use in a meaningful way, that will truly add value to their world--without overcommitting.  Once a tool proves itself in someone&rsquo;s world, they can choose to upgrade and evolve to more premium offerings.</p>
<p>All six tools from SmartBear will be added to my <a href="/apitools/">tools section</a>, which is meant to provide a toolbox of free and downloaded software for API owners and developers to take advantage of.  SmartBear says this is just the beginning and they will be adding more tools in the future.  As they become available I will publish and keep track of via <a href="/apitools/">API Evangelist tools</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/trends/baas.php">Backend as a Service</a> (BaaS) provider <a href="/serviceproviders/quickblox.php" target="_blank">QuickBlox</a> announced new <a href="http://quickblox.com/plans/">pricing plans</a>, which includes a free tier up to 10GB in traffic and storage, with unlimited API calls and push notifications.</p>
<p>The BaaS space is heating up with lots of discussion about whether you should charge developers by active user, features, storage or API call--with each provider being pretty vocal about where they stand.  Quickblox is approach similar to <a title="Stackmob" href="/serviceproviders/stackmob.php">StackMob</a>, who refuses to charge based upon API call, atributing it to a sucess tax. But Quickblox is somewhat different, as they still charge for hard costs like bandwidth and storage--Stackmob only charges by feature.</p>
<p>I'm trying to understand all the approaches to BaaS pricing, which was also a <a title="panel discussion last week at API Strategy &amp; Practice between Parse, Stackmob, Kinvey, Kii, Cloudmine and Firebas" href="/2013/02/25/the-baas-reality-tv-show-panel-at-apistrat/">panel discussion last week at API Strategy &amp; Practice between Parse, Stackmob, Kinvey, Kii, Cloudmine and Firebase</a>.  I don't think there is a one size fits all strategy here, but I predict the conversation around BaaS pricing will continue to heat up in 2013 as the market continues to define itself.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/26/api-transparency-report-as-essential-building-block/">API Transparency Report as Essential Building Block</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">26 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-transparency-report.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>After reading about <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/transparency-report-what-it-takes-for.html">Google&rsquo;s release of their transparency report last month</a>, I decided I would be <a href="http://apivoice.com/2013/01/23/making-transparency-reports-standard-operating-procedure/">addding API transparency reports to my list of essential building blocks</a> for API owners. Since I wrote that, I&rsquo;ve had a great post from EFF also <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/its-time-transparency-reports-become-new-normal">stating that its time for transparency reports to become the new normal</a>. &nbsp;Where the EFF outlines the illness in our current approach:</p>
<blockquote><em>When you use the Internet, you entrust your thoughts, experiences, photos, and location data to intermediaries &mdash; companies like AT&amp;T, Google, and Facebook. But when the government requests that data, users are usually left in the dark.</em></blockquote>
<p>In the United States, companies are not required by law to alert their users when they receive a government request for their data, and in some circumstances, they are explicitly prohibited from doing so.   So it is up to us, the users to join organizations like the EFF and let all online service providers understand the importance of transparency reports becoming default operating procedure.</p>
<p>Currently, we are only seeing transparency reports from providers like Google, DropBox, LinkedIn, Twitter and a handful of other service providers.  While I feel that all companies that run on users data should provide transparency reports, I&rsquo;m going to focus on making sure it is standard operating procedures with companies that deliver APIs.</p>
<p>As a starting point for my API transparency report building block, I&rsquo;m using the <a href="http://www.skypeopenletter.com/">letter that was drafted by concerned privacy advocates who are calling for Microsoft to issue a transparency report on Skype</a>, which it purchased in 2011 for $8.5 billion.</p>
<p>This letter states that:</p>
<blockquote><em> Skype is a voice, video and chat communications platform with over 600 million users worldwide, effectively making it one of the world&rsquo;s largest telecommunications companies.   Many of its users rely on Skype for secure communications&mdash;whether they are activists operating in countries governed by authoritarian regimes, journalists communicating with sensitive sources, or users who wish to talk privately in confidence with business associates, family, or friends. </em></blockquote>
<p>The Skype effort provides a beginning list of items all transparency reports should provide:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/electronic-frontier-foundation/electronic-frontier-foundation-logo.gif" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Quantitative data regarding the release of user information to third parties, disaggregated by the country of origin of the request, including the number of requests made by governments, the type of data requested, the proportion of requests with which it complied &mdash; and the basis for rejecting those requests it does not comply with.</li>
<li>Specific details of all user data a company currently collects, and retention policies.</li>
<li>The companies best understanding of what user data third-parties, including network providers or potential malicious attackers, may be able to intercept or retain.</li>
<li>Documentation regarding the current operational relationship between the company with and other third-party licensed users of company technology, including the companies understanding of the surveillance and censorship capabilities that users may be subject to as a result of using these alternatives.</li>
<li>A company&rsquo;s interpretation of its responsibilities under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), its policies related to the disclosure of call metadata in response to subpoenas and National Security Letters (NSLs), and more generally, the policies and guidelines for employees followed when a company receives and responds to requests for user data from law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the United States and elsewhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your company is going to provide a service that users depend on, one that retains their personal data in any way--you should have a transparency report that educates users about how and what any government is accessing and using information about them.</p>
<p>This applies to any data collected or transmitted via APIs from a platform via 3rd party platforms and services.  APIs owe it to end users to provide insight into how their data is being used by 3rd party application developers via oAuth, the same insight should be provided regarding how government organizations is accessing and using data as well.</p>

<p>My goal is to better understand what features are offered across these 31 BaaS providers.  To accomplish this, I spent no more than an hour per provider looking through their sites and playing with their products to get at least a basic understanding of their offerings.</p>
<p>When looking for features I tried to standardize the best I could, but it is difficult when there are different approaches to the deployment of resources on each platform.  I found about 75 distinct features being offered across the 31 BaaS providers.  I&rsquo;m sure there are other features, and vital details missing, but I wanted to start somewhere.

<p>One of the lively discussions at the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in NYC</a> last week was the backend as a service (BaaS) panel I moderated towards the end of the first day.</p>
<p>We brought together <span>Ilya Sukhar (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasu">@ilyasu</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.parse.com/" target="_blank">Parse</a><span>, Morgan Bickle (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/morganbickle">@morganbickle</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.kinvey.com/" target="_blank">Kinvey</a><span>, Marc Weil (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/marcweil">@marcweil</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cloudmine.me/" target="_blank">Cloudmine</a><span>, Miko Matasumura (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/mikojava">@mikojava</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://kii.com/" target="_blank">Kii</a><span>, Ty Amell (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/tyamell">@tyamell</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.stackmob.com/" target="_blank">StackMob</a><span>&nbsp;James Tamplin (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jamestamplin">@jamestamplin</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> to talk about the fast growing BaaS space.</p>
<p>I kicked things off with some pretty standard stuff, by having each person introduce themselves and explain what they do.   Next I asked them to explain what differentiates themselves from the other folks on the couch.</p>
<p>After that, things started heating up when I brought up a discussion about BaaS pricing, from an <a href="/2013/02/07/which-baas-pricing-model-is-better/">earlier online discussion about the mertits of user, feature or pricing base upon number of API calls</a>.  The common approach is user or api based pricing, with Stackmob focused on feature based BaaS pricing.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 50px;">

<p>The conversation was definitely lead by Ty Amell of StackMob, with pointed rebuttals from Ilya Sukhar of Parse, with Miko Matasumura of Kii in between, being very diplomatic while also throwing some jabs of his own. Morgan Bickle of Kinvey, Marc Weil of Cloudmine and James Tamplin of Firebase held their own, but it things were definitely overshadowed by the discussion by Ty and Ilya.</p>

<p>Next the panel moved the discussion to the future of Baas, with direct questions about what potential exit strategies are for each of the platforms.</p>
<p>At times the panel seemed like a reality show from the BaaS world or a daytime talk show featuring the leaders in the BaaS space.</p>
<p>The Backend as a Service panel really showed the personalities behind the leading companies in the space.  I was so engaged in the conversation, thinking about the next questions I can't recall everything that was said. &nbsp;I remember some pretty sharp comments from both Ty and Ilya. &nbsp;I look forward to watching again when the video is ready from #APIStrat.</p>

<p>I see a lot of dead simple, yet meaningful uses of APIs come across my desk (I don&rsquo;t have a desk, why do I keep saying this?) each day.  One I saw today is something every school, whether K-12, college or university should have.</p>
<p>Using the UC Berkeley API, you can get a list of all departments:</p>
<blockquote><em>_curl -v -X GET "https://apis-dev.berkeley.edu/cxf/asws/department?departmentCode=a&amp;app_id=309fe68e&amp;app_key=51b9d67dc4f0501eed763822a641b17b"_</em></blockquote>
<p>Then with the proper department code you can pull a list of classes:</p>
<blockquote><em>_curl -v -X GET "https://apis-dev.berkeley.edu/cxf/asws/classoffering?departmentCode=ARCH&amp;app_id=your-id&amp;app_key=your-key"_</em></blockquote>
<p>With the proper keys, anyone can easily pull relevant UC Berkeley department and class data to use in website or app, or even populate a Google Spreadsheet for other purposes.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/university/uc-berkeley/uc-berkeley-get-classes.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The <a title="UC Berkeley API Management" href="https://developer.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley API Management Portal</a> is brand new, I&rsquo;m still working on separate story regarding their approach, but I wanted to talk about how good it is to see such straightforward, valuable uses of an API at a leading university.</p>
<p>This simple example is something you should be able to do by default at all schools across the country.</p>
<p>The best part is that the API team is actively communicating these uses of the API on Google+, which is how I came across the story.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/25/exactly-the-api-strategy-practice-conference-i-envisioned/">Exactly the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference I Envisioned</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">25 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/api-strategy-practice-steve-kin-open.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>Its the Monday morning after the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a>.  The conference went off without a hitch, and was exactly the conference I envisioned when 3Scale first contacted me seven months ago about the idea of putting on the event. &nbsp;In July of 2012 Steve Willmott the CEO and founder of 3Scale sent me an email stating:</p>
<blockquote><em>..we're thinking of finally getting round to organizing an API focused event (conference) which tries to help spread knowledge about API, promote good practice and broaden the API tent beyond what it is today. The aim would be an event which combined both "business and practice" - meaning one element which tackles critical topics such as business models, strategy, success stories etc. and another which is about "what can be done with APIs" and "how to make it happen technically".</em></blockquote>
<p>Closing with:</p>
<blockquote><em>The final important thing is we'd like it to be a very open event - with a range of supporters, speakers and attendees and - while vendors might sponsor - it wouldn't be a "vendor" event.</em></blockquote>
<p>To which I responded with:</p>
<blockquote><em>Sounds like a great idea to me.  I'm in, and willing to help in any way I can.</em></blockquote>
<p>Of course I would be in.  I&rsquo;ve wanted this type of conference to occur for a while now, and what better way to make sure it happens right, than doing it yourself!  It was an amazing opportunity for me--there was no ignoring it.</p>
<p>As many of you know the original conference was scheduled for November 1st and 2nd in New York, City.  But due to hurricane Sandy, we had to postpone the conference and we ended up rescheduling it for last Thursday and Friday, February 21st and 22nd at the same venue--the Westin Grand Central in NYC.</p>
<p>In the end, the conference ended up with about 350 registered (<strong>SOLD OUT</strong>),with about what appears to be about 275-325 floating around each day, coming and going listening to <a title="talks from over 70 companies in the API space" href="/2013/02/12/companies-that-are-speaking-at-api-strategy-practice/">talks from over 70 companies in the API space</a>.  It was exactly the mix of folks I had hoped to see--ranging from marketing, advertising, business and developers who were new to APIs, to the moderately skilled players who were looking to polish their skills as well as being a who&rsquo;s who of API experts across the industry.</p>
<p>I did not get to attend as many of the sessions as I wished, and due to event coordination I wasn&rsquo;t always present main stage to hear complete talks. But on Monday morning here is what&rsquo;s fresh in my mind:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Laura Merling</strong> - Its great to see Laura&rsquo;s approach to helping organize AT&amp;T&rsquo;s API strategy.  I look forward to closely following not just her strategy, but understand her tactical considerations for helping the telco giant successful navigate the API space.</li>
<li><strong>Jeff Lawson</strong> - Jeff never fails to deliver.  He always has informative talks that are entertaining, but also deliver vital overviews of the space. &nbsp;This time its all about software people!</li>
<li><strong>Payments Session</strong> - I heard from several folks this session was a very lively discussion between Paypal and the newer generation of payment providers like Stripe, Braintree and Dwolla.</li>
<li><strong>Security Session</strong> - Like the payment one I was not present, but I heard from several folks there was a pretty interesting exchange.  I look forward to the video.</li>
<li><strong>Steve Klabnik </strong>- Everyone needs to be exposed to Steve&rsquo;s extremely clear perspective of not just open APIs, but open software development.  His talks are never about product or companies, they are more a philosophical vision that is rooted in a healthy understanding of developers, development communities and how it dovetails into society, business and politics.</li>
<a href="http://3scale.net" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 25px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
<li><strong>Backend as a Service Panel </strong>- I had so much fun on this panel.  I cannot wait to see the video.  The banter back and forth between <span>lya Sukhar (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasu">@ilyasu</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.parse.com/" target="_blank">Parse</a><span>, Morgan Bickle (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/morganbickle">@morganbickle</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.kinvey.com/" target="_blank">Kinvey</a><span>, Marc Weil (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/marcweil">@marcweil</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cloudmine.me/" target="_blank">Cloudmine</a><span>, Miko Matasumura (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/mikojava">@mikojava</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://kii.com/" target="_blank">Kii</a><span>, Ty Amell (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/tyamell">@tyamell</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.stackmob.com/" target="_blank">StackMob</a><span>&nbsp;James Tamplin (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jamestamplin">@jamestamplin</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> was priceless.  At times, it felt like reality TV show. There will definitely be more discussion about this panel.</li>
<li><strong>Jeff Meisel </strong>- I&rsquo;m captivated by the potential of National Instrument&rsquo;s Labview Tools API program.   His talk walked us through the potential from a platform that can provide any physically engineered object with an API.  Jeff&rsquo;s talk left my mind spinning with visions around the future of APIs.</li>
<li><strong>John Musser</strong> - John always delivers an education for anyone in the space, whether your novice, intermediate or expert.  And his 20 API Business Models in 20 Minutes continued this trend.  As someone who is immersed in the space as I am, I immediately recognize the amount of work and perspective that is needed to gather, organize and distill down a topic like this into a meaningful presentation.  Extremely valuable work.</li>
<li><strong>Daniel Jacobson </strong>- I thoroughly enjoy watching the evolution of not just Daniel&rsquo;s talks, but evolution of his and the Netflix perspective on APIs.  He talks about Netflix evolving beyond REST, and leaves it for you to decide if Netflix is just an edge case or signs what is to come in our every growing device driven, internet of things world.  I think we need to watch what Daniel and Netflix is doing very closely, and learn. </li>
<li><strong>John Sheehan</strong> - Dammit, I was running around during yours. I needed to watch this one--will wait for video.</li>
<li><strong>Albert Wenger</strong> - I&rsquo;m extremely fascinated with the VC perspective of all things API.  Especially one that is focused on the &ldquo;network effect&rdquo; like USV is.  I&rsquo;ve talked with USV and a couple of other groups in the last couple months regarding their portfolios and the overall APIs space, and I will definitely be talking to other firms in the coming months and writing more stories on this topic.  Extremely critical perspective of the space that I don&rsquo;t think is getting enough public discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Gray Brooks</strong> - APIs and the Federal Government is a piece of the API pie I&rsquo;m uber passionate about.  I thoroughly enjoy my regular discussions with the Senior API Strategist and the GSA and his talk delivered the mandate I feel is needed right now, not just for city, county, state and federal government to get on board with APIs, but also that us citizens become accountable for making this work as well!</li>
<li><strong>APIs, Platforms and Ecosystem </strong>- We closed up the conference with a panel made up of Tyler Stalder (<a href="https://twitter.com/tylerstalder">@tylerstalder</a>)&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="Singly" href="http://www.singly.com/" target="_blank">Singly</a>,&nbsp;Seth Blank (<a href="https://twitter.com/AntiFreeze">@AntiFreeze</a>) of<a title="YourTrove" href="https://www.yourtrove.com/">YourTrove</a>,&nbsp;Asif Rahman (<a href="https://twitter.com/asifrahman">@asifrahman</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="NewsCred" href="http://newscred.com/">Newscred</a>, Orian Marx (<a href="http://alpha.app.net/orian">@orian</a>) of<a title="App.net" href="https://join.app.net/">App.net</a>,&nbsp;Travis Wallis (<a href="https://twitter.com/traviswallis" target="_blank">@traviswallis</a>) of&nbsp;<a title="PeopleBrowsr" href="http://peoplebrowsr.com/" target="_blank">PeopleBrowsr</a>.  This panel closed up the event, leaving exactly the right tone with the audience I wanted.  Focusing at the heart of what makes APIs work, the relationship between platform, developers and users and what it takes to make it work in this new API driven world.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list doesn&rsquo;t even begin to sum up what happened at API Strategy &amp; Practice.  I will have to wait for the video to be produced from all keynotes, panels and sessions(which we will make sure and let you know when ready), to fully understand what happened across all four rooms of the amazing event.</p>
<p>Beyond the keynotes, panels and sessions and moving into the networking opportunity that was #APIStrat.  I met so many people that I know online, but have never met in person, my head is still swimming.   Every couple hours I had to walk outside and get some air, so I could keep up with the conversations.  It makes me remember how important these events are to re-enforcing our existing relationships.  Online will never fully replace offline relationships, just augment them in new ways...or maybe offline augments online? &nbsp;Who knows!</p>
<p>Next, I have to throw in a comment about the beer during the drinks reception.  Did you notice the IPA amongst the beer choices?  Nice work <a title="Ping Identity" href="https://www.pingidentity.com/">Ping Identity</a> and the 3Scale team.  It is the little things that make these events successful.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/augusto-marietta-mashape-apistrat.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Ok. I know there was more, but I will be writing stories from now until the next API Strategy &amp; Practice in October or November (more to come), and this post is pretty long as it is.</p>
<p>Anyways, I want to thank all the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sponsors.php">sponsors of API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> for making the conversation possible, and make sure the 3Scale team knows how thankful I am for what they did.  They took all the risk, while putting up with me and my shit, to make exactly the event I envisioned when we started all of this. &nbsp;It wouldn't have been possible without <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to leave you with wise words from <span>Augusto Marietti&nbsp;(</span><a href="https://twitter.com/sinzone">@sinzone)</a><span>&nbsp;the CEO of&nbsp;</span><a title="Mashape" href="http://mashape.com/">Mashape</a>. &nbsp;I snapped this picture exactly at the moment Augusto said:<strong>&nbsp;DON'T FUCK THIS UP!!</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree with Augusto. It is way too important. &nbsp;Let's make sure and keep these conversations going, so we do it right! &nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/google/google-html-developer-udacity-class.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Google is using the <a href="http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2013/02/udacity-html5-game-development-course.html">online learning platform Udacity to teach developers about game development</a>.  The new <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs255">HTML Game Development course</a> (CS255), is the online classroom for the programming class, coupled with a series of study groups hosted at Google's San Francisco office and a contest providing developers an incentive to complete the class.</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/live/">Google is kicking off the course with a live session</a>, with Udacity CEO Sebastian Thrun on Thursday, February 14th at 10:30 AM and the class<span>&nbsp;will be taught by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105062545746290691206/posts">Colt McAnlis</a><span>&nbsp;(Developer Advocate, Chrome Developer Relations),&nbsp;</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105062545746290691206/posts">Peter Lubbers</a><span>(Program Manager, Chrome Developer Relations), and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105495497383489174073/posts">Sean Bennett</a><span>&nbsp;(Architect, Udacity).</span></p>
<p>The HTML Game Development course from Google is an interesting approach to developer education by providing an online course bundled with in-person or streamed workshops and study groups, bundled with a contest to help motivate students.</p>
<p>I may create a blueprint for other API providers to follow, when launching their own courses in a similar way to Google.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/13/aws-api-reference-architecture/">AWS API Reference Architecture</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">13 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/aws/aws-ecommerce-reference-architecture.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was checking out the <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/02/three-new-aws-reference-architectures-for-e-commerce.html">updates to the AWS Reference Architecture</a>, where they provide blueprints for how you can use AWS. In this version AWS provides an e-commerce architecture reference--providing a system overview, a detailed architectural diagram, and a list of the AWS services used in the architectural approach.</p>
<p>The AWS e-commerce architecture reference provides three separate areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Web Frontend </strong>- This is a reference architecture for the web frontend of an e-commerce site. It makes use of Route 53, CloudFront, Elastic Beanstalk, S3, ElastiCache, DynamoDB and CloudSearch</li>
<li><strong>Checkout Pipeline </strong>- This is a reference architecture for a secure and highly available checkout pipeline service for an e-commerce site. It uses the Virtual Private Cloud, the Simple Workflow Service, Elastic Beanstalk, the Relational Database Service, and the Simple Email Service</li>
<li><strong>Marketing &amp; Recommendations Service</strong> - This is a reference architecture for a marketing and recommendation service for an e-commerce site. It uses Elastic MapReduce, S3, Elastic Beanstalk, the Relational Database Service, DynamoDB, and the Simple Email Service</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond providing the <a href="http://media.amazonwebservices.com/architecturecenter/AWS_ac_ra_ecommerce_webfrontend_14.pdf">detailed reference card</a>, AWS provides more information on a <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/aws-training/architect/">three-day course in AWS Architecture Training</a> that will be held in numerous U.S. cities this spring.</p>
<p>I will add API architecture references as a <a href="/">building block for API owners</a> to consider when planning and managing an API.  If you can provide clear blueprints for developers to follow, you can increase the chances developers will be successful with integration of an API into their application or systems.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> is happening next week in NYC. I have had so much fun pulling together the schedule of keynotes, panels, sessions and the talks on the 429 - Too Many Requests stage. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The number of requests we've received for sponsoring, speaking and attending has been overhelming. &nbsp;Resulting in a sold out conference, and an amazing lineup of speakers. &nbsp;I was spending some time tidying up the speakers page and sponsor page today, and was so impressed with the companies involved, I had to share.</p>
<p>There are 72 companies represented at API Strategy &amp; Practice:</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but I'm pretty blown away by the list of companies that will be attendance. &nbsp;I'm stoked we were able to pull together such an awesome lineup. &nbsp;I wish I could publish a list of companies who are attending, because that list would equally blow your mind. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's exciting to see the buzz around APIs in 2013, and I look forward to seeing you at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>.</p>

<p>Palo Alto has opened up city data, including <a href="http://paloalto.opendata.junar.com/dashboards/8031/library/" target="_blank">operational data about the Palo Alto City Library</a>.  Using the Palo Alto City open data portal you can access machine-readable data sets about various aspects of library operations including visitor count, checkouts by type of materia, information and circulation services, programs attendance, website visitors count and how library funds are spent.</p>
<p>The Palo Alto open data portal provides widgets with data grids and charts derived from data.  But you can also&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/gov/depts/it/open_data/suggest_a_dataset.asp">request data sets</a> and access data via the <a href="http://paloalto.opendata.junar.com/developers/">City of Palo Alto's API</a>.</p>
<p>The city hopes that it will increase community engagement by making data open and machine readable by default. The city is looking to throw hackathons that will develop solutions, and increase public engagement in city government, and ultimately save money and enhance city services.</p>
<p>The City of Palo Alto open data portal is provided by cloud-based <a href="http://www.junar.com/">Junar Open Data Platform</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/baas/openi/openi-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The <a title="Backend as a Service" href="/trends/baas.php">Backend as a Service (BaaS)</a> space is picking up momentum in 2013.  I&rsquo;m tracking on 20 BaaS providers, in hopes of better understanding what is being offered in this space.  Today I came across an interesting new, open source BaaS platform, being developed in the European Union called <a href="http://www.openi-ict.eu/" target="_blank">OPENi</a>.</p>
<p>The project describes itself as:</p>
<blockquote><em>OPENi is a European Union ICT Framework Programme (FP7) Information and communications technology (ICT) Collaborative project. Over the 30 month project duration we aim to deliver an open-source, cloud based platform for integrating mobile services.</em></blockquote>
<p>With a mission to:</p>
<blockquote><em>Our mission is to inspire innovation in the European mobile applications industry, by radically improving the interoperability of cloud-based services and trust in personal cloud storage through the development of a consumer-centric, open source mobile cloud applications platform.</em></blockquote>
<p>With the following objective:</p>
<blockquote><em>OPENi&rsquo;s objective is to directly address the lack of interoperability between cloud based services and enable applications to access and use a broad spectrum of existing cloud based functionality and content, consistently across different devices and platforms, in a way that enables a user-centric application experience. Targeting the needs of Application Developers, Services Providers and Consumers, OPENi will realize its vision for user-centric, cloud-connected, mobile applications.</em></blockquote>
<p>OPENi is a 30 month project, we will have to wait and see what comes out of the iniative. With the EU approach to open data and data privacy, I think there is a lot of potential to deploy and consume APIs, as well as delivering API automation, interoperability and backend platforms that have a healthy, consumer-centric approach--which I believe will be good for business, because its good for ender users.</p>
<p>In early 2013 the OPENi team will release software for the BaaS platform as an open-source project on github.com.  When released I will evaluate it side by side with the other BaaS providers I&rdquo;m tracking on.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-API-Automation.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time lately thinking about <a title="emerging trends in API usage" href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">emerging trends in API usage</a>. One area I&rsquo;m tracking on, is around companies that are offering simple services that provide interoperability and automation between cloud platforms, using APIs.   The best known examples are from companies like <a title="IFTTT" href="http://ifttt.com">If This Then That (IFTTT)</a> and <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, who provide end users with simple icon based tools for defining  tasks that move data between SaaS platforms.</p>
<p>Its tough to define this space, which in enterprise speak is really just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">Extract Transform Load (ETL)</a>, which is historically a process to migrate information between systems in an enterprise, using data sources and web services.  But with the popularity of web APIs, we need to rethink ETL in the context of the cloud and update how we approach interoperability between the growing number of API driven platforms.</p>
<p>Mike Reich of Seabourne, and I were discussing this last time I was in Washington D.C., and he currently has a great blog post on <a title="rethinking ETL in the API age" href="http://seabourneinc.com/2013/02/08/rethinking-etl-for-the-api-age/">rethinking ETL for the API age</a>.  If you don&rsquo;t know <a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/">Seabourne</a>, they are behind high profile government projects like <a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/">MyFCC</a> and <a title="GovInfo" href="http://govinfo.io/">GovInfo</a>.  They have been doing a lot of thinking about how to acquire, process and publish content with APIs.</p>
<p>To better help <span style="text-decoration: underline;">me</span>&nbsp;better understand the space, I&rsquo;m watching 12 service providers that I&rsquo;m putting in a bucket of what I consider the next generation of ETL providers:</p>

<p>I feel that this new group of ETL providers are focused sufficiently on the new world of API driven platforms, beyond just "data sources" and "web services".  There are more providers like <a href="http://apatar.com/">Apatar</a> and <a href="http://www.jitterbit.com/Solutions/etl-data-integration">Jitterbit</a>, but I feel these providers are more ETL than, than reflecting new breed of API interoperability providers (which I don&rsquo;t have proper name for yet).  One characteristic I&rsquo;m looking for is ease of use.  I think this new breed should be more for end-users, SaaS users and ultimately empowering the masses--not IT, which I feel ETL is designed for.</p>
<p>This new generation of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/interoperability.php">interoperability providers</a> should be about solving the problems average users face when operating online and in the cloud, and not just extracting, transforming and loading--making ETL something anyone can understand and put to use. &nbsp;Further democratizing IT resources, which is a common theme with SaaS, APIs, etc.</p>
<p>I think the new players like Zapier and IFTTT have to be concerned with getting too complex for everyday users, become more ETL, than being about solving end-user problems.  I think we will need very specialized, niche implementations--much like we are seeing with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/baas.php">BaaS</a> and the emergence of specialized versions like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/01/new-open-source-backend-as-a-services-platform-for-game-developers/">BaaS for gaming</a>.  Very niche versions of ETL like <a title="SortMyBox" href="http://www.sortmybox.com/">SortMyBox</a> and <a href="http://wappwolf.com/dropboxautomator/">WapWolf Dropbox Automator</a>, which focus only on solving file management problem users are facing, will be successful, because they are easy for users to understand and put to work.</p>
<p>I think there is an opportunity to quickly build the next generation ETL solutions that solve a set of automation, integration and interoperability problems for a niche audience using the simple icon based format we are seeing from providers like IFTT and <a title="Elastic.io" href="http://elastic.io/">Elastic.io</a>.  If you are considering building one of these new solutions, make sure and evaluate existing open source ETL solutions like:</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel, by rolling out your own ETL framework if at all possible.  This will allow you to focus on the specific acquire, transform and publish needs of your niche audience.  Even some of the new breed of providers are providing open source tools, like the <a href="https://github.com/rulesio/geekier/wiki">Geekier project</a> from <a href="https://rules.io/">Rules.io</a>, so do your homework. Also consider putting existing API aggregation providers like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> to use, providing faster acquire and publish API connections with popular APIs, while also standardizing the objects across all platforms.</p>
<p>I can envision video, photo, quantified-self and other niche services emerge that will empower any user to put APIs to use and acquire, transform and publish the valuable data, information and other content that are central to our increasingly fragmented online lives.  These new solutions will be framed in easy to understand terms that speak to specific audiences,  putting valuable API resources within reach of the masses.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been processing a <a href="http://branch.com/b/apicalls-successtax">conversation over at Branch</a>, that was triggered by a story in TechCrunch by Sarah Perez(<a href="https://twitter.com/sarahintampa">@sarahintampa</a>) called, &ldquo;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/13/stackmob-ratchets-up-the-competition-makes-api-calls-free-launches-a-marketplace-for-third-party-mobile-services/">StackMob Ratchets Up The Competition: Makes API Calls Free, Launches A Marketplace For Third-Party Mobile Services</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There are several layers to the convSteersation, the part I&rsquo;m focusing on is about how BaaS providers are structuring their pricing, in which Sarah Perez writes:</p>
<blockquote><em>StackMob is now making API calls free. This latter news will impact the competitive landscape, which includes startups like Parse, Kinvey and others, all of which have traditionally charged developers as API calls increase alongside an app&rsquo;s popularity.</em></blockquote>
<p>Making the argument that:</p>
<blockquote><em>Today, developers have to have an understanding of how many API calls they make, and if an app becomes really successful, developers are penalized for that with increased pricing.</em></blockquote>
<p>Sarah quotes StackMob CEO Ty Amell, saying that:</p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t really all that fair, explaining that it doesn&rsquo;t matter to StackMob how many API calls the app makes &ndash; the cost to them doesn&rsquo;t really go up. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter to us whether someone&rsquo;s making a million API calls or 20 million API calls &ndash; the cost is fairly manageable on our parts. So we felt like this was a blocker to innovation on the developer&rsquo;s side,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;And we feel like API calls are starting to become a commodity, where it&rsquo;s really how can you provide value beyond that?&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>The conversation immediately begins on Twitter, with:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Steve <span>Gershnik</span>(<a href="https://twitter.com/StackMobSteve">@StackMobSteve</a>) of Stackmob</strong> - @stackmob doesn't charge for 'active users' either. No success tax for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Joe Chernov (<a href="https://twitter.com/jchernov">@jchernov</a>) of Kinvey </strong>- but you charge for features. In the end, everyone charges for something. It's business!</blockquote>
<p>After this, the conversation moves to Branch.  I&rsquo;m not including full comments, because there is a lot of banter back and forth, discussing various claims BaaS providers make, that I feel are irrelevant to the more important, pricing story.</p>
<p>The conversation continues:</p>
<blockquote><strong><strong>Joe Chernov (<a href="https://twitter.com/jchernov">@jchernov</a>)&nbsp;of Kinvey</strong>:</strong><br /> If a developer prefers to pay by number of users, our model may work for them; if someone would rather buy features, then StackMob may make more sense. It's all good. Everyone has their own twist on pricing. Vendors should strive to highlight their own value without misrepresenting others'. Fair?  Steve Gershnik (StackMob):<br /> We don't charge per user. We don't charge per API call. We think those are outdated and archaic pricing models.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Miko Matsumura (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikojava">@mikojava</a>) of Kii:</strong><br /> I respect what @StackMob is doing but in looking at their pricing page, isn't it just segmenting everyone into a free tier and a "custom" Enterprise tier?</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Steve Willmott(<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>)&nbsp;of 3Scale:</strong><br /> Which model is best in our experience depends a lot on what type of market you're serving - individual developers tend to like by the drop because (start cheaply and scale). Large companies tend to like predictability so they can budget properly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Box.net is a storage company - yet, for all their enterprise accounts storage is unlimited. Variable scared their customers. Instead they charge by number of seats/users - something their enterprise customers CAN predict.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Thinking more abstractly: If a developer is successful, there will be some sort of increase in volume. Unless the PAAS service is truly magical that means extra cost for the PAAS provider.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You can call this a success tax, but in my view what matters is not if there is more cost to the developer but if the unit cost goes down over time. I.e. As I succeed, I'm happy to pay you a bit more as long as you are not getting an increasing %age of the pie (and ideally if the %age is decreasing). If that %age increases I'll most likely ditch you for someone who offers me better terms at that point.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>QuickBlox(<a href="https://twitter.com/QuickBlox">@QuickBlox</a>): </strong><br /> Our pricing model is per API calls as well, we do it like that because it is clear for developers (and for our business model), also allows to create apps and prototypes that, in case they are not successful, the developers won't be charged. according to @jchernov</blockquote>
<p>Only Stackmob, Kinvey, Kii and Quickblox are represented in the <a href="http://branch.com/b/apicalls-successtax">conversation on Branch</a>.  So I wanted to see how each of the 20 BaaS providers I&rsquo;m tracking on, structure their pricing:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.apiomat.com/" target="_blank">APIOMAT</a> - Beta, can't find</li>

<li><a href="https://go.urbanairship.com/accounts/register/" target="_blank">Urban Airship</a> - Push Messages</li>
</ul>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find pricing for five of the BaaS providers, because they are in beta, but pricing by API call is definitely the preferred way for the rest of them, with 11 of the 15 using this approach.  The rest of them charge based upon a mix of number of users, number of apps, data and file storage, push messages, and email messages.  With Stackmob going with pricing based upon feature, add-on or premium services, which can also be from 3rd party services via the <a href="https://marketplace.stackmob.com/">StackMob marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t think there is one approach to API or BaaS pricing.  Seems to me, that different models will work for different industries, companies and even at the application level.  But I wanted to document this conversation for my <a href="/trends/baas.php">larger research project around the BaaS space</a>--maybe I will have more opinions after I dive in deeper.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think about BaaS pricing.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/05/white-house-announces-round-two-of-the-presidential-innovation-fellows/">White House Announces Round Two of the Presidential Innovation Fellows </a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-strategy/presidential-innovation-fellows.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program, launched last year, bringing in talented individuals from the private sector, to Washington DC for 6-12 month &ldquo;tours of duty&rdquo; in the Federal Government, to develop innovative solutions to our governments most difficult problems.</p>
<p>Today the United States CTO Todd Park and CIO Steve VanRoekel&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/05/throw-your-hat-ring-round-2-presidential-innovation-fellows-program">announced round two of the Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program</a>.  The first round of PIF projects included MyUSA (formerly known as MyGov), RFP-EZ, Blue Button, Better Than Cash, and Open Data Initiatives started in August 2012 with 18 inaugural Fellows.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure to be <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/10/13/heading-to-washington-dc-to-talk-apis-with-innovation-fellows/">invited in October to spend half a day talking to a group of the fellows</a>, and help make sure they had an awareness of the API space, empowering the group to make the biggest impact possible.  Last week when I was in DC, I also got to speak with a couple of the fellows as they were finishing up their tour of duty, and beginning to think about what is next.</p>
<p>The second round of the Presidential Innovation Fellows will tackle the following initiatives:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Disaster Response &amp; Recovery</strong> - Collaboratively building and &ldquo;pre-positioning" needed tech tools ahead of future emergencies or natural disasters in order to mitigate economic damage and save lives</li>
<li><strong>MyUSA</strong> - Simplifying the process of finding and accessing information and government services that are right for you. Helping American businesses access the information and services that will help them grow, hire American workers, and export to foreign markets</li>
<li><strong>RFP-EZ and Innovative Contracting Tools </strong>- Making it easier for the government to do business with small, high-growth tech companies, and enabling the government to buy better, lower-cost tech solutions from the full range of American businesses</li>
<li><strong>Cyber-Physical Systems -</strong> Working with government and industry to create standards for a new generation of interoperable, dynamic, and efficient &ldquo;smart systems&rdquo; &ndash; an &ldquo;industrial Internet&rdquo; &ndash; that combines distributed sensing, control, and data analytics to help grow new high-value American jobs and the economy</li>
<li>MyData Initiatives - Empowering the American people with secure access to their own personal health, energy, and education data</li>
<li><strong>Innovation Toolkit </strong>- Developing an innovation toolkit that empowers our Federal workforce to respond to national priorities more quickly and more efficiently</li>
<li><strong>21st Century Financial Systems </strong>- Moving financial accounting systems of Federal agencies out of the era of unwieldy agency-specific implementations to one that favors more nimble, modular, scalable, and cost-effective approaches</li>
<li><strong>Development Innovation Ventures</strong> - Enabling the US government to identify, test, and scale breakthrough solutions to the world&rsquo;s toughest problems</li>
</ul>
<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows will also continue work on the <em><strong>Open Data Initiatives</strong></em>, which will accelerate and expand efforts to make government information resources more publicly accessible in &ldquo;computer-readable&rdquo; form and spurring the use of those data by entrepreneurs as fuel for the creation of new products, services, and jobs.  The Open Data Initiatives will continue work on existing projects including health, energy, education, finance and public safety and global development, while also tackling new data innovation efforts including Building Virtual Learning at National Scale, Digital Tools for the Smithsonian and  work on next iteration of Data.gov.</p>
<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows programs represents an agile new approach to government, mimicking the same partnership it took to build the Internet over the last 30 years, through a partnership between government and the private sector.  This approach is about tackling big problems, using open software and open data approaches to a government that is not just open, but machine readable by default.</p>
<p>Its great to see the White House not miss a beat, with kicking off the second round of PIF.  Iniatives within the program are addressing some of the most important areas of our society and economy like education and healthcare, while also paying attention to innovative areas like physical hardware systems, new approaches to financial systems and applying technology intelligently through disaster response and recovery.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to evaluate more of what was accomplished in round one, and closely track who is accepted into the program for round two.  I think the program has the potential to help fix some serious illnesses with open, transparency and lack of machine readable data from government agencies.  My only addition to the program would be another tier of volunteers called Presidential Innovation Corps, where talented individuals who did not make it as fellows could still be put to use for other smaller initiatives and crowdsourcing opportunities--this group represents a lot of excitement, passion and talent, and with the pool growing in round two it represents a large group of eager citizens not being put to use.</p>
<p>If you believe in APIs, and believe they can transform how our government operates, I encourage you to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/InnovationFellows">apply for the Presidential Innovation Fellows program</a>, and potentially participate in some serious change for our country.</p>

<p>There is an interesting <a href="http://blog.parse.com/2013/02/01/instadm-brings-private-messaging-to-instagram/" target="_blank">post on the Parse blog</a> about <a href="http://insta.dm/" target="_blank">instaDM</a>, which is a service built using Parse, the <a href="/trends/baas.php" target="_blank">BaaS platform</a>, that provides private messaging in the Instagram ecosystem.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting approach to externally developing features for another platform or service.  I think Parse says it well:</p>
<blockquote><em>Even the hottest new apps, however, aren&rsquo;t perfect and that&rsquo;s where clever innovators can fill in the gaps with a great idea. Parse-powered instaDM is one such innovation.</em></blockquote>
<p>On one hand, this approach is a gamble.  All Instagram has to do is copy what you've done, put it in the roadmap, and your done. &nbsp;Finished.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think this is a very realistic way of pushing a platform forward, by external developers, using APIs.  If an API provider is smart, when you have someone in your ecosystem roll out a valuable feature like this, you invest in their success.</p>
<p>Building features that augment web or mobile apps like this demonstrate that API ecosystems offer a lot potential for innovation, and I have to say it is even more interesting that this is being built on Parse--probably a whole other story in itself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think every idea that comes out of Silicon Valley should be VC size. APIs allow more lots of smaller, more sustainable features to emerge, that don't need large scale investment. instaDM is an example of this potential.</p>

<p>Salesforce talked a little bit about its <a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2013/02/new-eclipse-plugin-available-february-15th.html">strategy around the development and release strategy around the Salesforce Eclipse plug-in</a>. &nbsp;Providing a little transparency into how they stagger its API releases as well as waiting to release their <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> plug-in, until API release is complete.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more interested in this story from an <a href="/buildingblocks/">API building block</a> perspective.  An eclipse plug-in seems like a building block for only the most mature APIs out there, and especially ones targeting the enterprise.  An eclipse plug-in is not for every API, but I think I will add it as a building block to consider.</p>
<p>It also seems like something a 3rd party provider could step up and find success with as well, by building a single or suite of Eclipse plug-ins that provide integrated API developer tools across popular or high value web APIs for Eclipse users.</p>
<p>I believe IDE plug-ins for APIs will be one way we can provide API discovery solutions for developers, by bringing valuable, qualified API resources into their development environments.</p>

<p><a href="http://googleadsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2013/01/new-simplified-adwords-api-pricing.html" target="_blank">Google is adjusting their pricing model for the Adwords API</a>, acknowledging that having a free usage tier is important. &nbsp;Making the API easier to access, while also ensuring a certain QOS.</p>
<p>Google has opted to go with two levels of API access:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Basic</strong> - Basic access is provided by default and allows up to 10,000 operations per day</li>
<li><strong>Standard</strong> - Standard access is available to qualified developers and has no daily limit on operations</li>
</ul>
<p>With both basic or standard access, there are no charges for <a href="https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/" target="_blank">AdWords API</a> usage.  Google is just looking to maintain quality over which developers can hammer on the API, while acknowledging a free tier allows for experimentation and innovation. &nbsp;All you have to do is apply to be part of the standard level, if you reach limits of basic tier.</p>
<p>This is a good model for even a totally open data of free resource APIs.  While you want your data and resources to be open, you also want to be able to offer a certain quality of service, and keep infrastructure costs to a minimum.</p>
<p>To do this, you will need to to secure the API interface to some degree.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/platform-stability.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>I did a <a href="/2013/02/01/a-conversation-about-apis-in-washington-dc/">presentation at the DC API Meetup</a>, when I was in Washington DC last week. My talk was some of my usual material around the history, business and politics of APIs, but included a section on trends, where I covered some of the newer aggregation providers like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, BaaS providers like <a href="http://parse.com">Parse</a> and automation tools like <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the meetup, we did a QA panel session, and Javaun Moradi (<a href="https://twitter.com/javaun">@javau</a>n), product manager at NPR digital, made a great point about the reliability and stability of this new generation of third party platforms building aggregate, backend, automation or other types of providers who are in turn, dependent on other API providers.</p>
<p>Javaun questioned the reliability of this new generation of startups, who are newly funded, most likely not yet profitable, dependent on other APIs, and are most likely going to be acquired later on down the road, or go out of business when funding runs out.  Javaun felt that established players like Salesforce and Google are here to stay, you know they aren&rsquo;t going anywhere--where a new startup has greater potential for service disruption and instability.</p>
<p>If you are building your app, and depending on an aggregate API service like Singly, or backend as a service (BaaS) platform like <a href="http://cloudmine.me">Cloudmine</a> or reliant on a automation platform like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, you want to know the company is going to be around in a year.  Right?</p>
<p>In my opinion, the number one way these new breed of startups can alleviate these concerns, is by solving developer problems, delivering value (which every company I&rsquo;ve mentioned is doing) and have a clear business model. Success is the best solution, right?</p>
<p>Another way these startups can instill confidence in the developers who are building apps around around their services is to also offer open source options.  By offering API aggregation, backend and automation as a cloud service, while also as open source download and fork, this new breed of providers can do a lot to build confidence and goodwill with potential users.</p>
<p>Some good examples of this are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a></strong> - Singly AppFabric empowers you to add social login, sharing and friend finding into your mobile and web applications, and <a href="https://github.com/Singly/hallway">Singly Hallway</a> is the open source version to help developers build amazing applications combining data from many sources easily, through one API.</li>
<li><strong><a title="OpenKit" href="http://openkit.io/">OpenKit</a></strong> - Open source, cross-platform backend services for game developers.  It will be available as client and server download on Github, and no mention if it will be a cloud service</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://rules.io/">Rules.io</a></strong> - Rules.io is a rules and segmentation engine with companion <a href="https://github.com/rulesio/geekier/wiki">Geekier</a> which is part of the rules.io service as an open source framework</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just just a couple examples of how startups are emerging to provide a new approach to rapidly and efficiently building web and mobile apps across many APIs.  These platforms are all about delivering the resources developers need to efficiently build and manage web and mobile apps, without the overhead of rolling out the infrastructure on their own.  With an open option, if for any reason the startup should change or go away, app developers have the option to put the open codebase to use.</p>
<p>This approach will not be for all startups, but with the neck breaking pace in which startups are born, evolve and die, and open by default approached bundled with a healthy as a service option, looks like a positive approach for platform providers, developers, end users and the overall business sector.</p>
<p>As more providers emerge in this space, I hope they choose to adopt an open by default approach.</p>

<p>For the longest time I would get asked, "Which API service provider should I use to deploy my APIs?".  This was a tough question, because historically the API management providers don't help you deploy your APIs, they only help you manage them.</p>
<p>Deploying your APIs was up to you.  Generally you already had some sort of internal system that you would use to generate RESTful interfaces or you'd go find your own open source API framework and deploy.  Then you'd proxy or connect your API to one of the API service providers.</p>

<p>These lines are now blurred by providers like <a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/">Intel with their enterprise API gateway</a>, and through API deployment resources from <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>.  3Scale is investing in open source server technology for <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">NGINX</a>, and blueprints for API deployment using Amazon Web Services.</p>

My favorite part is that everything in this tutorial is completely FREE.  A critical element to experimenting with APIs.</p>
<p>The 3Scale, AWS walk-though provides details for:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Creating and configuring EC2 Instance</li>
<li>Preparing Instance for Deployment</li>
<li>Deploying a demo API solution</li>
<li>Enabling API Management with 3Scale</li>
<li>Implementing an Nginx Proxy for Access Control</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several important things going on here, beyond being able to do this for free with an entry level AWS and 3Scale accounts.  But I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough, the value of this being free and allowing you to explore, experiment and iterate with your API--without spending a fortune!  This is critical to not just your API initiative, but contributes to a more healthy API space in general.</p>
<p>After being free, you are using proven open source technology like Ubuntu for server OS and NGINX for your web server.  <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/11/15/3scale-launches-open-source-api-proxy-build-on-ngnix/">3Scale has invested in tools for NGINX</a>, rather than building their own proprietary solutions, because NGINX has been proven to deliver at scale and has large community to support it.</p>

<p>Third, with this solution, you retain control over your infrastructure.  You are deploying on the proven Amazon cloud (which I hope you are already using in other areas), and you are connecting to free API management services with the opportunity to buy premium services.  You are not proxying all your data and valuable API resources through a 3rd party proxy.  You are connecting to the API management services you need like rate limits, access controls and analytics without giving up control over your data and resources.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do the <a href="http://www.3scale.net/2013/02/quickstart-tutorial-on-how-to-deploy-an-api-on-amazon-ec2-for-amazon-web-services-aws-rookies/">3Scale API deployment tutorial</a>&nbsp;myself, so that I know the process inside and out, have my own AMIs ready to deploy on AWS, and be able to walk others through, when possible.</p>

<p>The library's collection has a total of more than 7,000 hours of sounds, the result of an 80-year collaboration between the scientific community and the library's volunteer collaborators.  An amazing resource!</p>
<p>I couldn't help myself, and emailed them, to let them know a web API of the audio and video collection would be a great addition.  If developers could build web and mobile apps around the sounds, it would extend the reach of the catalog exponentially.</p>
<p>Of course you'd do it in a way that adds value to the collection and <a title="protect it as a brand" href="/2013/01/29/protecting-your-brand-with-api-branding-guidelines/">protects it as a brand</a> and priceless asset.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/02/one-api-discovery-definition-to-rule-them-all/">One API Discovery Definition to Rule Them All</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">02 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/discovery/discovery-exploration.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I talk about API discovery, in-person at events, or on my blog(s), I notice people automatically default to thinking I mean a universal API discovery language that will work for all web APIs.  I think the technologists that operate in the API space are always striving for technical perfection--resulting in the discussions that you see around REST, HATEOAS, OAuth and similarly for this one about API discovery.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for the passion and dedication of the technologists in this space, but when it comes to API discovery, I&rsquo;m <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> talking about a universal language or approach.  I personally just don&rsquo;t believe there can be one definition to rule them all.  When I reference API discovery, I&rsquo;m focusing on API discovery at the provider level, and providing information and resources that allow people who launch APIs to be successful.  I have no interest in defining or support a world-wide or industry level definition for API discovery.  I leave these conversations to all y'all tech pundits.</p>
<p>I am a fan of supporting API providers to do something, anything! Sure, it should be a standardized as you feel necessary.  I hope you use something that is already in existence like <a title="WADL" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">WADL</a>, <a title="Swagger" href="http://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mashery/iodocs">I/O Docs</a> (don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel), and make sure and look at the <a href="https://developers.google.com/discovery/">approach Google is taking with their API discovery service</a>--as they have some experience in the field.</p>
<p><a href="http://swagger.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/Swagger-Screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In reality though, your motivation to develop JSON or XML definitions for your API will probably be to provide interactive documentation or allow for easy generation of code libraries for your API--not discovery.  With the API discovery conversation automatically defaulting to a universal definition by the tech pundits, API providers will often avoid these discussions, leaving it a lower priority when planning and implementing an API.  Much like with HATEOAS, without concrete examples of value, API providers won&rsquo;t see value in providing JSON or XML definitions of their APIs.  Interactive docs and auto generation of code libraries are clear value propositions, and show potential for bringing discovery back to the forefront.</p>
<p>Once you have API definitions for all of your API endpoints, its pretty easy to publish a single manifest of all of your APIs in a single JSON (or XML) file in the root of your developer area.  Sure I would love all of these definitions to be the same, but I prefer a more pragmatic approach and will accept whatever a API service provider deems suitable for their APIs, and with the resources they have available.</p>
<p>If you think about how web page discovery came together in late 1990s with Yahoo, then solutions provided by Google, and even new approaches from providers like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>.  When it comes to API search and discovery, we are in circa 1997, if we compare it with web page discovery.  You have directories like ProgrammableWeb, but you also have newer vendors emerging like <a href="http://apihub.com">APIhub</a>, who potentially bring a new perspective to the table.</p>
<p>Since APIs are about &ldquo;programmatic discovery&rdquo;, I think how developers discover API will vary, occuring via these directories and hubs, but also occur via their chosen PaaS platform like Drupal, Heroku, Salesforce or with BaaS providers like Parse or Kinvey--as well as popular IDEs like Eclipse who allow for plugins.</p>
<p><a href="http://apihub.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mulesoft/API-Hub-Screenshot-2.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It will up to PaaS, BaaS or other 3rd party platform providers to assemble resource stacks that are meaningful to their community.  They will do the legwork to find best of breed API resources, which will be made easier if API providers provider JSON or XML definitions of their API resources, but not a requirement.</p>
<p>I believe that similar to website sitemaps, API discovery will have wider definitions that some follow, with successful vendor specific implementations as well, but ultimately it will remain largely imperfect and some API providers will do well, and others will implement poorly. &nbsp;The markets will decide! (<em>cringe</em>)</p>
<p>My object is to help the average API provider hear stories of other successful approaches, and identify the benefits, in hopes that they will implement something, anything! &nbsp;Allowing us to take baby steps forward in API discovery, not defining one definition to rule them all and nobody giving a shit, and we don't move forward at all.</p>

<p>Master API architect at <a title="Layer7 Technologies" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7 Technologies</a> Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund" target="_blank">@mamund</a>) has a great post this week on <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/blogs/index.php/four-tech-related-trends-that-will-shape-2013/" target="_blank">Four Tech-Related Trends That Will Shape 2013</a>.</p>
<p>One of the predictions that caught my eye was that <em>"individual service deployments on the Web will get smaller and more numerous"</em>--he clarifies it with:</p>
<blockquote><em>Influenced by the existence of the many mobile apps running on a single device, Web-based services will become small, single-focused offerings that (in the words of Doug Mcllroy) &ldquo;do one thing and do it well.&rdquo; This will also explode the number of available services. The advantage of this trend will be an increase in the agility and evolvability of service offerings. The challenge will be an increased need for governance at the &ldquo;micro-service&rdquo; level.</em></blockquote>
<p>I have to agree.  I think the smaller we can break resources down, the better.  Agility is key in the API economy.  But as Mike points out it won't come without its new set of problems, like life cycle, governance and discovery.</p>
<p>Much like web pages, I think we'll still try to estimate the number APIs available, but there will be so many, we will lose track in the near future.  But we'll find an organic approach to designing, deploying, managing, discovering and consuming web APIs that strikes a balance.</p>

<p>One of the predictions that caught my eye was that "server mash-ups will increase but client mash-ups will decline"--he clarifies it with:</p>
<blockquote><em>The increasing popularity of languages like Node.js, Erlang and Closure will make implementing server-side mash-ups more efficient and easier to maintain than doing the same work within a client application; especially for the mobile platform. This will reduce the &ldquo;chattiness&rdquo; of client-side applications and increase the security and flexibility of server-side implementations. The result will be a perceived increase in responsiveness and a reduced use of battery power on mobile apps.</em></blockquote>
<p>As with my earlier post, <a title="individual API deployments will get smaller and more numerous" href="/2013/02/02/the-scientific-archive-of-biodiversity-audio-and-video-recordings-needs-an-api/">individual API deployments will get smaller and more numerous</a>, I agree 100%.  This is where I&rsquo;m going with my post this week on <a title="Virtual API Stacks" href="/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stacks</a>.  With so many individual resources available on the web, in the coming years we&rsquo;ll see increased &ldquo;mashing up&rdquo; or &ldquo;virtualization&rdquo; of new stacks, that are meaningful to a particular app or group of developers.</p>
<p>An example of this in the wild is&nbsp;<a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, with their API aggregation or mashup, which is available as a service, but is also <a href="https://github.com/Singly/hallway">available as open source on Github as Hallway</a>.  Another recent example is potentially the <a title="OpenKit Gaming BaaS" href="/2013/02/01/new-open-source-backend-as-a-services-platform-for-game-developers/">OpenKit Gaming BaaS</a>, which promised to be an open stack designed for game developers.</p>
<p>My predication is we&rsquo;ll see many more returns from server side API mashups, than we did during the client side mashup gold rush days! &nbsp;Especially if providers open source these stacks, while also offering as a service.</p>
