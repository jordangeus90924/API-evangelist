I was directed to an API question today, that needs to be asked constantly in the space:

My response was:

This is such a relevant topic I wanted to continue the conversation by listing the top 10 things that drive me crazy when integrating with a new API:

  * **Incomplete or Cumbersome Documentation** \- Definitely something that will keep you from a achieving a successful integration and make you walk away from an API
  * **Lacking Code Samples **
