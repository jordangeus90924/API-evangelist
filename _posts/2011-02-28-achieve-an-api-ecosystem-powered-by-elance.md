Taking an API from area to community takes a lot of work. It just doesn't happen overnight. It takes a perfect balance of technology, developers, partners, resources and hard work. <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/ecosystem.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> APIs are a big part of the future of a distributed workforce, and developer communities like [Elance][1] are building the workforce to support the APIs. You can leverage the Elance platform to:

  * Providing High Quality, Professional Developers
  * Develop API SDK and Code Samples
  * Develop API skills test and accreditation
I have developed this prototype [API developer area][2], driven by the Elance community to show what is possible using the [Elance API.][3]

Using the power of the existing API developer community at [Elance][1] you can quickly take your API beyond community and build a living [API ecosystem][4].
