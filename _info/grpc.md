gRPC is an open-source high-performance remote procedure call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment, efficiently connecting services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication. It is a solution for delivering industrial-grade distributed computing to devices, mobile applications and browsers to backend services. Right out of the box, gRPC brings numerous benefits to your operations and your approach to delivering APIs.

gRPC provides a very solid technical solution for delivering and maintaining infrastructure and backbone APIs within the enterprise, and possibly with partner and B2B solutions. gRPC is not an entry level pattern like REST. While it can provide streaming APIs like WebSockets, gRPC is a much stricter and more disciplined approach to delivering API infrastructure, providing yet another solid pattern you can apply as part of your API-first transformation.
