     I came to Washington DC this week for meetings with a couple federal agencies and a handful of private companies who contract with our government--including a conversation last night at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-Web-API-User-Group/events/97891662/">DC API Meetup Group</a>, which met at NPR offices downtown.
