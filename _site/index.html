		<p>API Evangelist is about making sense of the world of application programming interfaces, or simple APIs. APIs have become part of every layer of our Internet connected world over the last 20 years, and this is my research project into understanding what is happening. As of 2019 I am also the Chief Evangelist for Postman, but I still use this site in the same I have since 2010, as a scratch pad for what I am working on, and stories about I see APIs being used.</p>
		<p>This isn't meant to be a blog in the traditional sense of the word, and you should think of it as Kin Lane's personal notebook that he is fine with others reading. If you have any comments about my work feel free to take it to Twitter and engage with me there, or if you feel like you'd like to talk to me personally, feel free to email info@apievangelist.com.</p>

								<h4>Making Sense of the Different Types of API Testing</h4>
								<p>I have to admit something. I don&rsquo;t fully grasp the entire landscape of API testing. I mean, I have a pretty decent awareness and experience in testing APIs, but I can&rsquo;t close my eyes and coherently break down each layer or type of testing, let alone competently navigate the many different types of services and tooling available on the market for API testing. Like most other dimensions of the API universe the content and guidance on the subject of API testing is all over the place. After a couple of hours Googling and making my way through my bookmarks, I uncovered a pretty expansive dictionary for what I&rsquo;d consider to be under the umbrella of API testing. First off, I have to talk about API testing in the most general sense before I get into the more and less formal API testing approaches. It was a dimension of API testing I hadn&rsquo;t considered before I began working at Postman, but API testing meaning that I am just kicking the tires on a API, learning what it is all about, and how you use it. This is what the majority of Postman&rsquo;s 13 million users are doing when they say they are testing an API with the Postman platform. THis experimental and curious approach to API testing provides a great onramp to the world of API publishing and consumption, but does little to help us articulate what API testing is or isn&rsquo;t. Beyond just &ldquo;testing out&rdquo; an API, from what I...</p>

								<h4>Keeping API Entropy Low is Needed to Continue API Growth and Expansion</h4>
								<p>I love the word entropy. It means so many things to so many different people. In means different things in the physical realm versus the informational or virtual realms. It is one of those big words you can say to confuse people, or actually get yourself in trouble being able to actually defend your position on what entropy means when around smart people. It is said that famed mathematician John Von Neumann had told fellow mathematician and creator of Information Theory that he should use the word entropy instead of information because that no one understands entropy and then you can win arguments about your theory. I also read that Shannon and Norbert Weiner also dueled over the meaning, seeing it in very opposite ways. I like the word for all of these reasons, but mostly because of its relationship to uncertainty.&nbsp; In the realm of physics entropy means, a thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of disorder or randomness in the system In the more virtual realm of information theory, the entropy of a random variable is the average level of information, surprise, or uncertainty inherent in the variable's possible outcomes. While I could easily use entropy as a metaphor for APIs in the physical sense, it is really the appropriation of it for information theory that really brings it home for me. Entropy in Shannon&rsquo;s time was centered around noise or static in communication,...</p>

								<h4>Examples of Minimum Viable and Complete Landscape APIs.json Index Files</h4>
								<p>I am preparing for the next version of APIs.json and I am taking another pass over what the specification is, but also taking a fresh look at why the specification exists. Part of this fresh look involves assessing what I consider to be the low bar for an APIs.json index, as well as what the entire scope might look like. To help me (and you) understand the scope of what APIs.json or APIs.yaml can do when it comes to indexing our API operations and making them discoverable in a machine readable way. The most important thing to remember about APIs.json is that it is all about indexing API operations in a way that acknowledges that there are two sides of this API integration game which need to be indexed and made discoverable across an organization. Human Readable - Providing URL references for the aspects of API Operations that human stakeholders will need to understand what is happening with APIs and how to put them to work in applications. Machine Readable - Providing URL references for aspects of API Operations that are system and applications can use to make sense of API Operations, accessing as a machine readable definition. APIs.json is about indexing all of these human and machine readable aspects of our API Operations with an emphasis on evolving human readable elements to also be machine readable so that as much of the surface area of our API operations is indexable by other systems and applications as possible. There is...</p>

								<h4>Evaluating APIs.json API Property Types Alongside OpenAPI Extensions</h4>
								<p>I am giving some much needed love to my APIs.yaml and API.json API discovery format while using the work to also just think about the wider API landscape. This is the original intent behind APIs.json&hellip;to help me make sense of the API landscape.&nbsp; Most folks are thinking about APIs as a producer, or as a consumer&mdash;hopefully both. However, there are fewer people who also pay attention to the entire API landscape, and APIs.json emerged out of this need for me in 2014. In 2020 I find myself totally immersed in the API landscape as part of my API Specification Toolbox project which grew out of Postman becoming a member of the OpenAPI Initiative, and I wanted toht spend why Saturday afternoon (I know I have a problem) thinking about the API landscape at the 250K.&nbsp; APIs.json API Property Types Using APIs.json or APIs.yaml you can define the properties of one or many APIs for a variety of purposes. Each API you describe can have an array of properties which can be common human readable elements like documentation or sign up, as well as machine readable properties like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, or JSON Schema. APIs.json property types are intentionally human or machine readable with the intent on evolving every human readable element to have a machine readable element&mdash;think the relationship between documentation (Human) and OpenAPI (Machine) when understand the objective. I have several thousand API Providers and API service providers in my API Evangelist database. I track on the properties of all...</p>
