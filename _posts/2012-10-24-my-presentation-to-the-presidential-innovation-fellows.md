{% include JB/setup %}<p>I spent two hours with a handful of the Presidential Innovation Fellows in Washington DC yesterday.They were some super savvy folks from a wide variety of agencies and backgrounds including education, energy and health.During my two hours with them I walked through several areas of the API industry, from my perspective, including: History of APIs API Planning &amp; Design API Development Business of APIs API Service Providers API Tools, Services, Platforms Politics of APIs API Evangelism What’s Next for APIs You can access my innovation fellows presentation off API Evangelist, I’ll leave it up permanently.It’s minus all my commentary and banter, but hopefully it will give you an idea of what I covered.If you’d like a custom presentation on it, let me know and I’ll see if I can find a slot to do a Google Hangout.</p>
