<p>As I&rsquo;m working through my tasks each day I am always looking for ways to automate away the cumbersome portions of what I need to accomplish. I am always weighing having to manually accomplish something over being able to write a script to accomplish something. It is always tempting to think about writing a scrape script to work through a pile of research I need to gather, and engineer some crafty algorithm that will help me sort through it and make sense of it all. As I get older I&rsquo;m finding that most of the time this automation is more about laziness than it is about the power of technology, or the benefit it can bring to my work. <br /><br />I am pretty good at calculating what it will cost for me to manually tackle something versus what it will take to automate something&mdash;if it is even possible in the first place. I&rsquo;ve gone down the automation road many of time only to establish pretty quickly that something isn&rsquo;t even possible, or that the quality of the results would be much below what I could deliver if I just rolled up my sleeves and did it manually. Over the years I&rsquo;ve learned to step away from the allure of automation, but it is still something that I still find myself thinking about way too much, simmering on some automation scheme, procrastinating about how much work something is, where if I just did the task manually, I could get done in half the time.<br /><br />As I dig into my API-driven automation fantasies I usually return pretty quickly with a realization that things are more about me being lazy or a procrastinator. I hate to admit it, but I think a significant portion of my belief in technology in my desire to get out of some work, avoid a mundane task, and accomplish some meaningless thing that I&rsquo;ve convinced myself is important, when it probably is not. Often times when I do automate something I will neglect scheduling or allocating the resources need to keep things running in the future, storing data, and publishing any insights or value from the automation. Most of the times I would be better off accomplishing a one-time task manually than spending more time automating it in a way that I will rarely ever use again.<br /><br />I think I need to learn to be more honest with myself in the future about what automation is worth it and what is not. I think I need to just get more organized about specifying the work that needs to get done, and queueing things up&mdash;getting work done with good ol fashioned elbow grease. I just have too much evidence demonstrating that the ROI on automation doesn&rsquo;t always pay-off, and I need to get better at thinking things through. I&rsquo;m not talking about abandoning API automation, I&rsquo;m just talking about being more structured in how I approach getting work accomplished, and being more critical about how and what I automate. Being more of a grownup when it comes to just realizing that sometimes it will take a significant amount of one-time human effort to tackle something, and I need to save my API automation skills for when it is really needed.</p>
