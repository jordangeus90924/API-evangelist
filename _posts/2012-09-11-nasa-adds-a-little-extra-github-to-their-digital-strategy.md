{% include JB/setup %}<p>I’ve been tracking the adoption of the White House CIOs digital strategy, trying understand each agencys mobile and API plans.Today I noticed that NASA, in addition to publishing their digital strategy in HTML, XML and JSON, added a recent commits Github widget on their digital strategy homepage.It’s a small, but very important addition.It shows that NASA sees the importance of not just using Github, but pushing code and interacting with developers via the social network.Github is a service that is getting more traction within government, and I hope that more federal agencies don’t just put it to use, but make it part of the culture within their organization.</p>
