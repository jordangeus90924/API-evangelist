I'm spending a lot of time lately evaluating the various API management service providers like [3Scale][2], [Apigee][3], [Mashery][4],and [Mashape][5].

One thing that I have to explain a lot to people about these API management services…is they are API management services. Not API deployment services.

The only one provider that has a solution to deploy your API is [Mashape][5], but now there is a new provider gearing up, called [Apiary.io][1]. Apiary.io wants to make developing and implementing APIs a quicker process.

Apiary.io site says they will also help you describe, test, manage and share your API with developers.

I feel that API deployment services is a huge opportunity in this space, its good to see a provider step up that will help API owners deploy their APIs, as well as manage them.

[Apiary.io][1] is still in private Beta, so I can't take it for a spin yet. It will be interesting to learn more about what this latest API service provider can bring to the table.
