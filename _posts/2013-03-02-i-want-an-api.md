{% include JB/setup %}<p>I feel we have done a good job explaining what is an API, why people need APIs, and providing services to manage APIs, but we are falling short on delivering information, tools and services for deploying APIs.First I want to acknowledge that many companies have established IT resources, in the form of technology talent, and internal systems they can put to use when deploying APIs.This post isnâ€™t for you.This is about individual problem owners looking to deploy APIs, who most likely have little or no access to traditional IT resources for a variety of reasons.You want to deploy an API, because you havplease some data, content or other resources you need to make accessible to partners or the public, allowing for integration into other systems or be used in the development of web or mobile applications or possibly even data analysis and visualizations.</p>
