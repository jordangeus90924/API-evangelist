     <a title="Foursquare API" href="https://developer.foursquare.com"><img class="c1" src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/foursquare/foursquare_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>

     I am going through the <a title="Foursquare API" href="https://developer.foursquare.com">Foursquare API</a>, and found their section about how to get an increase in the number of calls you can make against the Foursquare API interesting:

<p class="c2">
     <em>If your application runs into any of our rate limits and you think you could use more, write us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7617061f36101903040507031704135815191b58">[email&#160;protected]</a> We'llneed your OAuth consumer id, an explanation about why you need an increased cap, and information about the following</em> 

<ul class="c3">
     <li>
          <em><strong>Usage</strong>: A description of the endpoints you're calling and how you're using the data retrieved. We use this to make sure you're abiding by our <a href="https://foursquare.com/legal/api/platformpolicy">Platform Policies</a> and <a href="https://foursquare.com/legal/terms">Terms of Service</a>. Sample requests are generally helpful.</em>
     </li>
     <li>
          <em><strong>Attribution</strong>: Screenshots of your application so we can confirm you're <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/attribution.html">attributing</a> foursquare correctly.</em>
     </li>
     <li>
          <em><strong>Caching</strong>: Cache venue details where appropriate to avoid making spurious requests to our servers. See theRetention section of our <a href="https://foursquare.com/legal/api/platformpolicy">Platform Policies</a> for more details.</em>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I like the idea of rewarding developers with the ability to make more calls against your API, when they adhere to your terms of service and benefit your operations.
