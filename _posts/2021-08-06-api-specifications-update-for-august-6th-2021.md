    - API Specification Update
---


I try to stay up to speed with what is happening across the leading API specifications each week. The evolution of [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/), [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/), and [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) is important to what I do at Postman, but also to the wider API space. I find it helpful to understand what is happening across each of the API specification communities, and I wanted to also find a way to share what I am seeing with everyone else. Providing a single digest of what is happening, without having to do all the work I am doing each week. While I am sure there is much more going on that I am not tuned into, here is a snapshot of what I see happening.

### Recent Meetings

    - [**Providing Decentralized Storage to Hedera NFTs**](https://thetokenizer.io/2021/08/02/filecoin-and-hedera-hashgraph-announce-grant-program-to-propel-web3-interoperability/) - Hedera Improvement Proposal 10 (HIP-10) offers an ecosystem standard for NFT metadata. To bolster this new functionality, Filecoin (specifically, the&nbsp;NFT.storage&nbsp;service) enables decentralized storage of the JSON schema containing those NFT properties and multimedia or localization data.

### Conclusion
This was my second attempt at doing this type of summary. I will also be posting a little about the process I am using to make this post happen. I will be looking to evolve my approach, and of course, if there is anything missing from my summary of what is going on in the world of API specifications, please let me know! As part of this process I am working to get folks behind the meetings, discussions, and other goings on to be more public about what they are doing so I have a URL to share. Once I get a hang of regular updates for these three specs I will consider adding GraphQL and gRPC. I will be publishing this to the API Evangelist each week (time allowing), and featuring the latest one on the home page. I am also working on updating the home page of [the API Specification Toolbox](https://api.specificationtoolbox.com/) to showcase how you can learn, implement, and contribute to each of the specificationsâ€”-once I have up, I will link to more from this regularly summary. My goal is to provide a single place everyone can go to get involved within the communities for each of the API specifications, but also stay up to speed on what is going on each week.
