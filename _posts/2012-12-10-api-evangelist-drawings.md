{% include JB/setup %}<p>While I was in Paris speaking at API Days last week, a drawing of me was circulated on Twitter. I was a little speachless when I saw them on Twitter. I am always looking for new graphics to use in API Evangelist. I worked for hours to come up with the logo I have, so I was stoked to see someone create something so cool, in the moment.Thanks @bybent, art director @fabernovel for the drawing.</p>
