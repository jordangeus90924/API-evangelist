<p>With over 100 APIs, and an army of developer advocates, Google is one of the top API ecosystems in the world, alongside Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>Google is stepping back and rethinking how they interact and support their developer community and are <a title="looking for feedback" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/09/what-does-it-mean-to-be-google.html">looking for feedback</a> from the developer community.</p>
<p>They want to know what inspires you as a developer, what does being a Google developer mean to you, and how Google can make your experience as a developer better.</p>
<p>Facebook has made a tremendous effort to better engage their developer community with <a title="Facebook Operation Developer Love" href="/2011/04/30/facebooks-operation-developer-love/">Operation Facebook Love</a>, and its really good to see Google make a similar attempt.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/10/02/learning-management-system-lms-apis/">Learning Management System (LMS) APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">02 Oct 2011</span>
        <p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/LMS/learning-kids.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     At <a title="Mimeo" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> I get approached by a lot of customers who use various learning management systems, and ask if they can print training and classroom materials from their LMS. I ask them the name of their LMS system, then set out to research what is possible.
</p>
<p>
     I've researched almost 30 LMS systems so far (according to my notes), and I've come across 3 that have APIs. I'm in talks with a fourth, <a title="Schoology" href="http://apievangelist.com/apis/schoology_api.php">Schoology</a>, that has an API as a premium feature, but information is limited and they are super busy with the new school year.
</p>
<p>
     Here are the three LMS platforms that I've come across that have APIs:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a href="http://gls.agilix.com/Docs/Concept/Overview"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/LMS/BrainHoney-Logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a><a href="http://gls.agilix.com/Docs/Concept/Overview"><strong>BrainHoney</strong></a> – A learning management system providing course authoring, learning objective management, and gradebook management
     </li>
     <li>
          <a href="http://apievangelist.com/apis/haiku_learning_system.php"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/LMS/haiku-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a><a href="http://apievangelist.com/apis/haiku_learning_system.php"><strong>Haiku Learning System</strong></a> – Learning management system providing website design and development, listserve hosting, assignment dropboxes, and more for teachers to take classrooms online
     </li>
     <li>
          <a href="http://help.litmos.com/developer-api/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/LMS/litmos-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a><a href="http://help.litmos.com/developer-api/"><strong>Litmos</strong></a> – Litmos is a SCORM-certified, learning management system, that enables developers to connect their applications to the Litmos training engine, providing deeper integration of training data generated in Litmos with any other systems
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I find it pretty disturbing that only 3% of the learning management systems have APIs. APIs are essential not only to providing data portability for your customers, but can open up entirely new sales channels for an LMS provider.
</p>
<p>
     A web API can enable other content systems and applications to incorporate your LMS into their application. An API will not give away your content or intellectual property, it will open it up and allow you to build new types of revenue channels with customers who might not have adopted your platform by itself, without seamless integration with their existing systems.
</p>
<p>
     My <a title="research into the dcuation and learning management space" href="http://apievangelist.com/industries/education.php">research into the education and learning management</a> space is still in its infancy. If you know of any tools I should evaluate, please let me know. Whether its K-12, Higher Ed, or corporate learning, education is one space that dramatically benefit from the power of the API.

        <span class="post-date">29 Sep 2011</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/API-Evangelist-Thirds.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>Historically APIs are deployed to provide data and resources to business partners.  However, in the last 5 years we have seen a shift in focus to also delivering more open, publicly focused APIs, based upon the success of popular services like <a title="Google Maps" href="/2011/01/30/history-of-apis-google-maps-api/">Google Maps</a>, <a title="Twitter" href="/apis/twitter.php">Twitter</a> and <a title="Twilio" href="/apis/twilio.php">Twilio</a>.  In the last year, many companies are also seeing the benefits of deploying and consuming APIs internally, in addition to partner driven, and open public APIs.</p>
<p><a title="3Scale" href="/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a> and&nbsp;<a title="Mashery" href="/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a> all advocate for evaluating the deployment of APIs for internal and partner consumption as well as carefully weighing the value of a public facing API ecosystem.  As an API evangelist I aslo have found the need for equal distribution of resources when it comes to evangelizing the benefits of APIs as well.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Internal API Evangelism</strong> - I spend â of my time educating internal departments from IT to marketing about the benefits of APIs.  I want everyone to understand that APIs will make our company more flexible and nimble, and help us out-maneuver our competitors.  APIs also will assist us in delivering mobile content and applications within our company and to our customers.</li>
<li><strong>Partner API Evangelism</strong> - I spend â of my time educating our partners about the various APIs we have, how they can be used, and provide as much material as I can about our web services.  I also evangelize about other APIs that compliment our services and can provide benefits to our partners.  Its not just about selling our partners on our services, its letting them know we are invested in their success.</li>
<li><strong>Public API Evangelism </strong>- I spend â of my time blogging, tweeting and generating code samples, prototypes and any other materials that will help get the word out to the public about our APIs.  Public API evangelism is not just about SEO content, its about social engagement.  Reaching out to developers and companies where they already frequent, making sure I listen, participate and add value to those communities on behalf of my company.</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs are not just an external interface.  Although they do offer tremendous benefits when interacting with the public or sharing information and resources with your most valued partners, they can also make your company operate more efficiently.</p>
<p>API evangelism shouldn&rsquo;t be just about reaching out to your public or partner developers.  Your API evangelism strategy should also focus internally within your company and across all departments.  Make sure your API evangelism strategy is equal parts internal, partner and public outreach and eventually you will find the success your looking for.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Sep 2011</span>
        <p><a title="Klout API" href="http://developer.klout.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/klout/Klout-API-Overview.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Klout" href="http://klout.com/">Klout</a> just updated their API area. The <a title="Klout API" href="http://developer.klout.com/">Klout API</a> was originally released in 2009, but the new API area has several improvements including faster response times for the API, better documentation and improved terms of service.</p>
<p>Using the Klout API developers can pull someones Klout Score, which is the measurement of their overall online influence using social networks like Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+.   It provides a way of essentially high-grading users on your network, and rewarding or engaging users differently based upon their overall network influence.</p>
<p>I categorize the Klout API as a &ldquo;partner API&rdquo;, meaning that can add value to just about any existing API community and application.  For example, with my <a href="http://developer.mimeo.com/">Mimeo Connect Document Printing APIs</a>, a print application could offer lower pricing to a user based upon their Klout score.  If you are building a poster, flyer or book printing application and you offer lower pricing to people who are influencers, you can probably bet they&rsquo;ll talk about your app within their network.</p>
<p>The Klout API opens up a lot of opportunities for web and mobile app developers to enrich their understanding of their existing user base, identifying the users that are the biggest influencers, and may contribute to a larger network effect around their application.</p>
<p>Klout has delivered their API using the <a title="Mashery API Platform" href="/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery API platform</a>, you can register for an API key and learn more about the platform at <a title="developer.klout.com" href="http://developer.klout.com">developer.klout.com</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Sep 2011</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-API-Advertising.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of the things I do here at <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist</a> is review APIs for their owners and provide suggestions for how they can improve the technology, ecosystem and better monetize their API.</p>
<p>When it comes to monetization many of the API owners seem to have a good grasp of how they are covering the base costs of operating their API, but are looking for ways to expand their revenue, and actually make their API profit engine.</p>
<p>Just like with web and mobile applications the first way people think about monetizing their API is using advertising.  Though I don&rsquo;t always agree with employing advertising as part of an API ecosystem, it makes sense that many owners are considering it.  Advertising has been a primary revenue generator for web sites and applications, and has become a staple for mobile applications, using mobile advertising platforms like <a title="AdMob" href="http://www.admob.com/">AdMob</a>.</p>
<p>With this growing demand, I see a huge opportunity for someone to step up and provide a plug-and-play advertising network that API owners can deploy as part of their API ecosystems.  An API advertising network could provide broad or specialized sponsored content that could be delivered within existing API content.   An API advertising network would have different ways to filter and tailor content so advertising would not be intrusive and blend with the content already being delivered as part of an API, whether its delivering text, images, audio or video.</p>
<p>API advertising networks would have revenue sharing for developers built in.  As an API owner I could choose to share advertising revenue with my developer ecosystem in any amount I wanted.  Advertising would be pushed to all API calls made by developers, but they could be given an option to register for the revenue sharing program, and the system would track all ads delivered through a developers site or application, and pay out associated revenue.</p>
<p>Web advertising models like Google Adsense are great for website and application development, and mobile advertising platforms like AdMob are delivering for mobile developers, but there is a need to meet the advertising needs of API owners and their developer ecosystem.  API advertising will need to deliver adaptive models that evolve with the new API economy, and help API owners further monetize their content and resources, while also providing much needed revenue sharing for their developer community.</p>
        <ul class="actions" style="text-align: center;">

        <span class="post-date">27 Sep 2011</span>
        <p>
     <a href="http://www.glitch.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/glitch/glitch-logo.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com/">Audrey</a> introduced me to a very cool gaming company the other day called <a title="Tiny Speck" href="http://tinyspeck.com/">Tiny Speck</a>. The company, the latest project of Flickr co-founder Stewart Butterfield, has released its first game to the public today: <a title="Glitch" href="http://www.glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. Glitch is a web-based massively-multiplayer game. The game allows you to choose how to grow and shape the world: building and developing, learning new skills, collaborating or competing with everyone else in one enormous, ever-changing, persistent world.
</p>
<p>
     Glitch is a visually stunning game environment, delivered using a flash client (although the startup does state other clients will be available someday). There's a lot that's familiar about the game, particularly to fans of MMOs and social games -- Glitch is a combination of the two, arguably. But where Glitch really strikes me as doing something new is with its back-end. Glitch uses a low level Java back-end with game logic scripted in JavaScript, built on a suite of APIs, allowing for maximum flexibility and easy deployment. No surprise, it's this API piece that strikes me as compelling and different from other games.
</p>
<p>
     <a href="http://www.glitch.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/glitch/glitch-universe-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I do have a list of game-related APIs to evaluate, I just haven’t had the time to dive in too deeply. But at first glance most game APIs tend to only deliver meta-information about games, profiles, and the communities around games. Though I don’t doubt APIs drive a lot of game development, most developers I’ve talked to don’t think much about it, let alone make the APIs public or showcase them.
</p>
<p>
     Glitch could be a “game-changer” in that Tiny Speck has built its game around the API, as well as exposing these same APIs to its developer community, enabling them in turn to build web, iOS, and Android games around the Glitch universe.
</p>
<p>
     <a href="http://www.glitch.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/glitch/glitch-universe-2.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     The Glitch API uses JSON over HTTP or HTTPS, in an RPC style, allowing parameters to be passed via GET or POST vars, with an available JSONP callback. The API provides access to players, skills, avatars, achievements, auctions, calendars and locations within the game.
</p>
<p>
     I hope there are other gaming platforms employing APIs in this fashion, if you know of any let me know. Glitch is the first game I’ve seen build an entire game upon APIs, enabling the ultimate amount of flexibility in its development and deployment, and also opening this power up to the gaming community to create an endless, ever-changing, persistent gaming universe.

        <span class="post-date">26 Sep 2011</span>

     <a href="http://ww1.jeppesen.com/main/corporate/land/journey-planning/index.jsp" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/jeppesen/jeppesen-logo-400.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I wrote about the <a title="need for more transit API" href="/2011/09/11/the-need-for-more-transit-apis/">need for more Transit APIs</a> a couple weeks ago, and the opportunity for some company or organization to step up and coordinate transit APIs on a global, country, regional and local level. Also the opporunity for developers to provide local resources for building applications, "acquiring" of local data, understanding local constraints, and be the overall contact for a specific locale.
</p>
<p>
     To me, there appears to be a hunger for transit data, and there is a major gap in how this "public data" is being made available for developers to build websites, web and mobiles apps, that businesses and commuters can use. The opportunity is so big, that tech savvy commuters are stepping up, scraping data, and building transit APIs and applications themselves.
</p>
<p>
     I had a lot of people contact me after my post, but one clear player emerged, that appears to be just the company I was looking for. That company is <a title="Jeppesen" href="http://ww1.jeppesen.com/main/corporate/">Jeppesen</a>, a Boeing funded company that has a new service called the <a title="Jeppesen Journey Planner API" href="http://ww1.jeppesen.com/main/corporate/land/journey-planning/index.jsp">Jeppesen Journey Planner API</a>.
</p>
<p>
     Jeppesen has developed a very robust set of transit APIs, providing:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Public Transit Journey Plans</strong> - Request multimodal public transit journey plans
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Polyline Trip Details</strong> - Draw the journey plans on a map
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Stop Locations</strong> - Locate all the public transit stops within an area
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Stop Timetable</strong> - Obtain a list of departures (or arrivals) from a public transit stop
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Walk Journey Plans</strong> - Request walking journey plans between locations
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Service Provider</strong> - Identify the public transit service providers in an area
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Fares</strong> - Find out the cost of the journey (when transit fare information is available)
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Trip Timetable</strong> - Discover all the stopping points for a specific trip
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Jeppesen is aggregating data from transit agencies around the world, including 23 regions in the US, and locations in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK, into a single set of web services. Jeppesen has enough markets to be a viable option, and they are looking to add more markets in the near future.
</p>
<p>
     Their pricing is very affordable and is broken down by stop timetable and journey planning requests. Even though the API currently targets the enterprise and businesses, it is low priced enough that individual developers could use to build applications, that they could monetize and build a viable business around.
</p>
<p>
     <a href="http://ww1.jeppesen.com/main/corporate/land/journey-planning/index.jsp" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/jeppesen/Jeppesen-Journey-Planner.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     Jeppesen has spent the last 18 months developing the transit API, looking to provide high quality data aggregation for developers. The API has just been made available for production and has partners in Australia and the UK building applications on the platform.
</p>
<p>
     The Jeppesen Journey Planner API comes in both SOAP and RESTful flavors, with C#, Java and Python code samples. The API is brand new so it lacks other code samples, mobile SDKs, and other community aspects that we are used to with more mature APIs. However, the API is very well done, walking you through an overview of the API, its features, and pricing--while also providing very simple and complete API documentation.
</p>
<p>
     <a title="Registration for the transit API" href="http://ww1.jeppesen.com/main/corporate/land/journey-planning/signup.jsp">Registration for the transit API</a> is not self-service, but they offer a free trial and I had my API key within 24 hours of submitting the request form.
</p>
<p>
     There are still a lot of questions to be answered regarding how Jeppesen will incentivize partners and developers to build applications around the API, will there be revenue sharing opportunities, and what type of local, regional outreach and support there will be. But I'm sure these questions will get answered in time.
</p>
<p>
     For now, Jeppesen shows a lot of potential to be transit API player I was looking for. I think they have a lot of work ahead of them, to meet the transit data needs of enterprise and businesses, while also satisfying the needs of local commuters, especially those very tech savvy ones we see demanding high quality access to their areas transit data.

        <span class="post-date">25 Sep 2011</span>
        <p><a title="Twilio Connect" href="http://www.twilio.com/api/connect"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/twilio/twilio-connect-screenshot.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>During <a title="TwilioCon" href="http://www.twilio.com/conference/">TwilioCon</a> last week I covered the release of Twilio Connect in two posts, starting with, "<a title="Twilio Introduces Twilio Connect, Its New In-App Billing Model" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/09/21/twilio-introduces-twilio-connect-its-new-in-app-billing-model/">Twilio Introduces Twilio Connect, Its New In-App Billing Model</a>" on <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, and on API Evangelist with, "<a title="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/09/20/twilio-connect-is-oauth-for-api-billing/" href="/2011/09/20/twilio-connect-is-oauth-for-api-billing/">Twilio Connect is OAuth for API Billing</a>".</p>
<p><a title="Twilio connect" href="http://www.twilio.com/api/connect">Twilio Connect</a> is a new billing solution that enables developers to offload charges for Twilio API usage to their application users, rather than their own Twilio accounts, and billing customers separately.  Twilio Connect is modeled after OAuth in that it uses a &ldquo;two-legged&rdquo; process for application users to setup and authenticate a payment relationship with Twilio, that a developer can leverage within their app using a token.</p>
<p>I mentioned lightly in my post on API Evangelist:</p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;OAuth 2.0 allows for designation of which account resources a developer can access, enabling users to approve at a very granular level, which could very easily be used for billing access as well.&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>Then yesterday I got called out on Twitter by <a title="Travis Spencer" href="http://travisspencer.com/">Travis Spencer</a> (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/travisspencer">@travisspencer</a>), stating that because Twilio did not use OAuth 2.0 to implement Twilio Connect, it was a step backwards, and I was irresponsible for not calling Twilio out on this.  He is totally right, and I humbly admit to not covering this story well enough.</p>
<p>In most cases OAuth is implemented for basic user account authentication, but with the introduction of OAuth 2.0 you can use for authenticating access in a very granular way for any user resources that you choose.  So it could be very easily used for billing authentication, and its irresponsible of Twilio to not embrace industry standards, and developing their own, proprietary, one-off implementation.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/oauth/oauth-basic.png" alt="" width="400" /></p>
<p>OAuth has a reputation for being tough to implement, both from a provider standpoint as well as working with as a developer, but with each version it is getting easier to use, and since its being widely accepted as an industry standard it is all of our responsibility as API owners to make sure it is used properly, and help developers understand the benefits.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/oauth/oauth-additionalscope.png" alt="" width="400" /></p>
<p>Travis is right, and using widely accepted standards like OAuth 2.0 make API consumption easier.  API owners need to implement OAuth for user account authentication, as well as adding additional scope for accessing other user resources such as billing.</p>
<p>Twilio leads in many ways when it comes to API ecosystem management, but they should have implemented Twilio Connect using OAuth 2.0.</p>
<p>Thanks Travis for calling me out, I always welcome anyone to keep me in check, and happy to admit when I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working on reviewing various APIs as part of my <a title="database industry overview" href="/industries/databases.php">database industry overview</a>, where I&rsquo;m trying to understand the different approaches to delivering database platforms using web APIs as the primary interface.</p>
<p>One of these database platforms is <a title="Database.com" href="http://www.database.com">Database.com</a>.  I really like what <a title="SalesForce.com" href="http://www.SalesForce.com">SalesForce.com</a> is doing with Database.com, but I take issue with their section declaring Database.com as an open platform.  SalesForce.com claims because you can access Database.com from any language, any platform, and any device through standards-based APIs, it is "open".</p>
<p>I think many folks in the enterprise space truly believe this makes something open.  All it means is, if you have the money and approved credentials, you can access.  If I launch a database on Database.com it is open for "me" to access, and those I give access to.  And yes, since it uses REST I am "open" to access via any language or platform I choose.  But I'm sorry, that does not make it "open".</p>
<p>I recommend SalesForce.com take a look at <a title="Freebase" href="http://www.freebase.com/">Freebase</a>.  All the data contained in Freebase is licensed by a Creative <a title="Creative Commons Attribution License" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">Commons Attribution License</a>, which means that it's free for you to browse, query, copy, and even use the data in your own systems or software, even for commercial use, all you have to do is attribute it back to Freebase.</p>
<p>Anyone has access to use and contribute to Freebase, as well as use any programming language or platform to access the data available on the platform.  Access to data is only one aspect of "open", developers must also be freely open to use and contribute to it, as the community sees fit.</p>
<p>As much as I love and evangelize the power of the API, an API alone does not make systems or data open.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Sep 2011</span>
        <p>
     <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/FAQ/Developer/Pages/RecoveryAPI.aspx"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/federal-government/recovery-org/Recovery-Gov-Logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I was reviewing the <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/FAQ/Developer/Pages/RecoveryAPI.aspx">Recovery API</a> yesterday, which gives you a RESTful API for exploring where all the money went as part of our governments Recovery Act. I have a sort of obsession with this kind of government data, and began playing with, and tracking on where the stimulus money went in my home state of Oregon.
</p>
<p>
     I started hacking on the API by manipulating the query string variables to get different types of responses on how stimulus money was spent by city, county and project types like roads, education and the environment. Since I’m a developer I’m very comfortable with hacking on the URL query string like this, but I noticed they also had a tool they called the, “<a title="Advanced Recipient Data Search Widget" href="http://www.recovery.gov/FAQ/Developer/Pages/AdvSearchWidget.aspx">Advanced Recipient Data Search Widget</a>”.
</p>
<p>
     The advanced recipient data search widget allows me to adjust the same fields, but using an actual form. Using the widget anyone can easily build requests against the Recovery API without being a developer, and I even found it allowed me to explore and understand the API quicker and easier. The widget even displays the final request string you can copy and paste and see the XML results in the browser or just as results grid on the screen. And you can also choose to download the results as a CSV when done.
</p>
<p>
     <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/FAQ/Developer/Pages/AdvSearchWidget.aspx"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/federal-government/recovery-org/recovery-org-widget-screenshot.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     The form could be better. It does not provide drop-down values for each of the fields, and the pop-up window is a little clunky. It still is a very useful tool helping not only developers get up and running, but allows the average user to come in and use, understand and export results from the Recovery API.
</p>
<p>
     I’m a big fan of <a title="API Explorer and Console Tools" href="/buildingblocks/api_explorer.php">API explorer and console tools</a>, but they still often are built for developers, by developers to explore and understand how an API works. The Recovery API’s, advanced recipient data search widget provides a much needed bridge for the average user to take advantage of the power of an API. At <a title="Mimeo" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a>, I’m taking many of my code samples and prototypes and making them live to not only show developers what is possible, but it also allows the average user to come in and use the <a title="Print and Publishing APIs" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">print and publishing APIs</a> without writing code.
</p>
<p>
     I think it is important for us to provide this type of bridge within our APIs so the average user can come and take advantage of our APIs. APIs are not just for developers, and these types of tools can really demonstrate the value of APIs to the average business person, which might just motivate them to find a developer and commission deeper integration with our APIs.

<p>To begin with, think about what a new user needs to know. If you can write for a new user, then you'll cover everything that an existing user will need to know. Once you have that mindset, answer the questions below. For a given element, some of the answers will be obvious from the context and not need to be documented, so use your judgment. In general:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>For collaborations or common interactions or scenarios, is there a conceptual topic that discusses this? If so, link to or reference the conceptual topic from the API topic.</li>
<li>For any elements that have a user interface component, is there a design guideline topic that discusses it? If so, link to or reference the design guideline from the API topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>For classes or structures:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>What function does it serve?</li>
<li>What other classes or structures does it interact with? What collaborations does it participate in?</li>
<li>What is its uninitialized state, if any?</li>

<p>If your company has an existing writing team, then the team will likely already have templates or guidelines for API reference documentation that address many of the issues discussed in this article. Just remember that the mindset of the people using your documentation is going to be a bit different that the mindset of the people designing or implementing the API. As a writer, you will need to translate between the two. If you keep these things in mind, it will be easier to write accessible and useable documentation.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/09/20/twilio-connect-is-oauth-for-api-billing/">Twilio Connect is OAuth for API Billing</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">20 Sep 2011</span>
        <p>
     <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/twilio/Twilio-Logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a> just announced a new API billing solution called Twilio Connect.  The new billing solution enables developers to offload charges for Twilio API usage to their application users, rather than their own Twilio accounts, and billing customers separately.
</p>
<p>
     Twilio Connect is modeled after OAuth in that it uses a “two-legged” process for application users to setup and authenticate a payment relationship with Twilio, that a developer can leverage within their app using a token.
</p>
<p>
     To start, developers put a Twilio Connect button in their application.  Application users then click the button and are taken to a secure Twilio page that allows them to setup a new Twilio account, requiring only the minimal needed information:  name, billing info, and email.   Upon successful setup, the application is then issued a token, which combined with a Twilio developers key, enables that application to consume Twilio API services, and bill to the users account.
</p>
<p>
     If you think about it, it makes perfect sense.  What OAuth has done for user account authentication,  Twilio is doing for developer billing authentication.  OAuth 2.0 allows for designation of which account resources a developer can access, enabling users to approve at a very granular level, which could very easily be used for billing access as well.  However the complexity of OAuth 2.0 can often scare away businesses looking to implement oAuth, and developers looking to build around an API that authenticates with OAuth.  Twilio is taking the best features from OAuth, while keep the developer implementation dead simple.
</p>
<p>
     Not all APIs would benefit from a billing authentication model like Twilio Connect.  It would work best for APIs that truly have a “cloud utility” model for their pricing, allowing developers to pay for only what they consume.  This would allow for the burden of billing to be lifted from developers, enabling them to do what they do best--code applications.  
</p>
<p>
     <img class="c2" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/twilio/twilio-connect-button.png" alt="" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     One problem I see here is that developers who rely on marking up underlying API services as part of their businesss model, would not benefit from a billing model like this.  But there is opportunity for API owners to take control of in-app billing, to make secure, and operate in the best interest of all application users, while also open up a new revenue sharing opportunity for their developers.  They could offer different percentages of revenue share depending on how much business a developers app generates.  
</p>
<p>
     Right now, the benefit for all developers may not be immediately clear, especially if they depend on revenue from these services, and there may be no benefit to the applicaiton user to have their own Twilio account.  It may actually add an extra unecessary step that could confuse a user during setup.  But think about when Twilio SMS and voice is ubiquitous across business, which is on its way.  A business could connect and disconnect its central telephony account from within different applications and services, and enable them to see their voice and SMS usage company wide, across a variety of applications.
</p>
<p>
     <a title="Twilio Connect" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/09/21/twilio-introduces-twilio-connect-its-new-in-app-billing-model/">Twilio Connect</a> an interesting approach to API billing. I like the way Twilio thinks, and the company continues to lead in the API space when it comes to making developers lives easier.  I can’t help but think of how this would benefit other APIs, and if this possibly could become a staple for APIs like OAuth has.

        <span class="post-date">20 Sep 2011</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-plus/google_plus.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Not even a week after Google rolled out the long awaited <a title="Google+ API" href="/2011/09/16/google-api-a-technology-review/">Google+ API</a>, they <a title="rolled out Google+ Hangouts API" href="http://googleplusplatform.blogspot.com/2011/09/introducing-google-hangouts-api.html">launched the Google+ Hangouts API</a>, enabling developers to build collaborative apps that run inside of a Google+ Hangout</p>
<p>The <a title="Google+ Hangout API" href="http://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/">Google+ Hangout API</a> will provide developers with the ability to manipulate the UI, interact with hangout participants and respond to the different events that occur within a hangout. &nbsp;The functionality is reminiscent of the way Google Wave gadgets and robots could interact with a wave and its participants. &nbsp;I wonder if we are seeing some of the Google Wave code being recycled?</p>
<p>To use Google+ you have to register your application with Google, and specify any other Google+ users on your team that will be able to load the application into their hangout. &nbsp;Since the Google+ Hangouts API is only in developer preview, this is temporary requirement.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-plus/google-plus-hangouts.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Once registered, apps behaves like a normal web app, but it also can take part in the real-time conversations within a hangout using the API. &nbsp;Google+ Hangout apps will use whats called a &ldquo;shared state&rdquo; among all instances, notifying users of changes by other application users in real-time.</p>
<p>The decision to release the Google+ clearly was a strategic move against Facebook, which I understand, but I still feel strongly that a empowering developers with a fully write enabled API from the beginning, is very important to setting the tone for the Google+ API ecosystem.</p>
<p>Many developers, including myself <a title="were not happy with the limited functionality of the Google+ API release" href="/2011/09/16/google-api-a-technology-review/">were not happy with the limited functionality of the initial Google+ API release</a>. &nbsp;However, I could tell that Google was being cautious in their API roll-out, and there is potentially much more behind the scenes. &nbsp;I expect Google will be rolling out new APIs as they feel confident, or maybe when they feel it will give them a strategic advantage, like this week during the <a title="Facebook F8 Conference" href="http://www.facebook.com/f8">Facebook F8 conference</a>.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/09/17/providing-code-libraries-is-not-enough-for-your-api/">Providing Code Libraries is Not Enough for Your API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">17 Sep 2011</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-API-Code-Samples.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><a title="Code libraries" href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/code_libraries.php">Code libraries</a> have been a staple of open API communities for quite a few years now. &nbsp;API owners provide developers with working samples of code in a variety of programming languages, to get started working with an API. &nbsp;Sample code helps developer get up and running quicker, and increases the chances a developer will actually adopt an API.</p>
<p>I was reviewing how Google approached the release of the Google+ API this week, and noticed their <a title="download section" href="http://developers.google.com/+/downloads">download section</a> not only contained the usual code libraries, but also contain whats called "starter projects". &nbsp;These starter projects provide a complete framework with everything you need to get start with OAuth, and to start building an application on top of the Google+ API.</p>
<p>Does this reflect the future of what API owners should be providing for their developers? &nbsp;Should we be providing web and mobile app starter projects to help get developers up and running with our APIs? &nbsp;These kits could assist them in moving from idea to integration, but starter kits might go even further than that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>By providing starter applications projects to our developers we can go beyond faster integration, and also help steer the quality of how applications are designed, ensure they using best coding practices, following security standards, and ultimately delivering better applications that are in line with the goals of the API owner.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-plus/Google-Plus-Starter-Projects.png" alt="" width="550" align="center" /></p>
<p>Companies don't just want developers using their APIs, they want them building quality applications around them, that reflect positively on the API. &nbsp;Starter projects, may be just the way to steer how developers build around an API, and guide them in a positive direction.</p>
<p>Starter projects do this from a functional perspective, but another example of this from the UI and branding perspective, can be seen with <a title="Twitters Bootstrap Toolkit" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter's Bootstrap toolkit</a>. &nbsp;Bootstrap is a toolkit from Twitter designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites, and includes base CSS and HTML for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation and everything developers need to build sharp looking Twitter web apps.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/Bootstrap-Twitter.png" alt="" width="550" align="center" /></p>
<p>I'm sure Twitter is interested in helping developers kickstart development, but ultimately they are helping developers build better looking apps that fall in line with Twitter's vision of what a Twitter client should look like. &nbsp;The Twitter Bootstrap toolkit helps jump start developers, but it also guides their UI to reflect the standards of the API owners, and can also help developers adhere to branding requirements.</p>
<p>I anticipate that providing code libraries and samples will not be enough in the future, and API owners will have to provide more complete UI toolkits, as well as starter web and mobile application starter projects that encourage developers to integrate, while also guiding them when it comes to best practices for their user interface, coding and security. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This isn't my idea, I"m just taking cues from two of the leading API providers, Google and Twitter. &nbsp;Will providing more <a title="building blocks" href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">building blocks</a> like starter projects and UI toolkits be the future? Or will it look more like what <a title="Facebook and Heroku are doing when it comes to application development" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/09/16/facebook-apps-in-the-cloud-made-easy-by-heroku-partnership/">Facebook and Heroku are doing when it comes to application development</a>?</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Sep 2011</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-plus/google_plus.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />I was happy to see <a title="Google launch an API for Google + this week" href="http://googleplusplatform.blogspot.com/2011/09/getting-started-on-google-api.html">Google launch an API for Google +</a> this week. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not chomping at the bit to build anything social on it, but I&rsquo;m glad they made it public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to take some time to review the API from a technology standpoint, and look at what possibilities it opens up for developers.</p>
<p>The <a title="Google + API" href="https://developers.google.com/+/overview">Google + API</a> provides a RESTful interface for the newly launched Google social network, Google +, &nbsp;and provides access to profile data and activity streams. &nbsp;The API uses <a title="OAuth" href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/oauth.php">OAuth</a> for authentication and JSON for its request and response formats.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. &nbsp;Pretty underwhelming from a developers perspective. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll be able to make some badges or widgets, maybe stream my activities in the sidebar of my Wordpress blog. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is my photo access (wait that is in Picassa), or my video access (wait that is in Youtube), &nbsp;or my social events (wait that is in Google Calendar)?</p>
<p>Ok, forget about about other content, what about my write access? &nbsp;I want to be able to write to my activity stream and update my profile. &nbsp;I want other apps that I authorize to be able to publish to my activity stream. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll stop there. &nbsp;Without write access, there is no use railing about lack of application platform, access to circles, and true data portability and ownership via the API.</p>
<p>In short, I think Google could have come out of the gate with a little more. &nbsp;Maybe linking up some of my other Google systems via my Google + profile, like Picassa images, and Youtube video. &nbsp;But more importantly developers should have write access. &nbsp;OAuth, plus write access to my social profile and activity stream should have been part of this release. &nbsp;&nbsp;It would have sent the right message to developers.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-plus/Google-Developers.png" alt="" width="580" align="center" /></p>
<p>I also understand how hard all of this is for them. &nbsp;They have a lot to consider, and pleasing developers are only one piece of the puzzle. &nbsp;&nbsp;But as we&rsquo;ve seen with Twilio and Twitter, your developer ecosystem can help make your platform have the applications and features users are looking for, making it a desirable place to be. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Platform success seems to come based upon the adoption of three key user groups: &nbsp;early adopters, developers and end-users. &nbsp;With Google + we&rsquo;ve just experienced the early adopter phase, what sort of environment will Google provide for developers during the next phase of growth.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/09/14/can-you-build-an-api-using-scraped-data/">Can You Build an API Using Scraped Data?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">14 Sep 2011</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/web-scraper.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I&rsquo;ve come across several APIs lately that rely on getting their data from web scraping. &nbsp;These API owners have written scripts that spider page(s) on a regular schedule, pull content, parse it and clean it up for storage in a database.</p>
<p>Once they&rsquo;ve scraped or harvested this data from the web page source, they then get to work transforming and normalizing for access via a RESTful API. &nbsp;&nbsp;With an API they can now offer a standard interface that reliably pulls data from a database and delivers it in XML or JSON to any developer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These API owners are still at the mercy of the website source that is being scraped. &nbsp;What if the website changes something? &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is definitely a real problem, and scraping is not the most reliable data source. &nbsp;But if you think about it, APIs can go up and down in availability, making them pretty difficult to work with too. As long as you have failure built into your data acquisition process and hopefully have a plan B, the API can offer a consistent interface for your data.</p>
<p>Web scraping is not an ideal foundation for building a business around, but if the value of the data outweighs the work involved with obtaining, cleaning up, normalizing and delivering the data--then its worth it. &nbsp;&nbsp;And this type of approach to data APIs will continue.</p>
<p>There is far more data available via web pages today then there is from web APIs. &nbsp;This discrepancy leaves a lot of opportunities for web scrapers to build business around data you might own, and you make available online, but haven&rsquo;t made time to open, control and monitor access to it via an APi.</p>
<p>The opportunity to build businesses around scraping will continue in any sector until dependable APIs are deployed that provide reasonable pricing, as well as clear incentive and revenue models for developers to build their businesses on.</p>

     <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Hurricane-Irene.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Last week I covered <a title="Centralized Geo Data with New InfoChimps API" href="/2011/09/01/centralized-geo-data-with-infochimps-new-api/">Centralized Geo Data with New InfoChimps API</a>, and talked about how I felt it was a <a title="Look at the Future of Data" href="/2011/09/01/a-look-at-the-future-of-data-apis/">Look at the Future of Data</a>.  After writing I started thinking about other data that is ready for the same type of treatment that InfoChimps is giving geo data.<br />
     <br />
     <span>I was reading <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey’s</a> post today on O’Reilly today called, <a title="a new look at weather data" href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/09/weatherspark-weather-data-visualization.html">A new look for weather data</a>, where she talks with <a title="Weatherspark" href="http://weatherspark.com/">WeatherSpark</a> co-founder <a title="Jacob Norda" href="http://twitter.com/#!/jacobnorda">Jacob Norda</a> about his company's approach to weather data and visualizations.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>Norda talks about where the problems with traditional weather information are, how WeatherSpark gets its data, and how weather data can be improved overall.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>It seems weather data suffers from all the same problems as geo data, such as multiple sources, varying schemas, huge datasets that are not easy linked with other sets of data.   Weather data has huge legacy system usage as well as massive growth in generation and consumption with the introduction of sensors and mobile devices.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>Norda concludes the interview by saying, “We're considering offering a unified API, but it's in the pre-roadmap stage at this point.”  Seems like a common theme with data and APIs, lately.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>What other areas of data are reaching this point, where developers could benefit from a unified API?</span>

     <p>
          Let's take inventory of what types of printing services are available.  First Google provides a web-based framework for registering, access and printing to any web-enabled printer.  And The Newspaper Club API provides newspaper layout tools.  Those really are print related, but not necessary produce print as a final product.
     </p>
     <p>
          When it comes to actual printing, there are an assortment of business documents including books, binders, newsletters, booklets, cards, spiral notebook.
     </p>
     <p>
          Some big name photo printing services, and nice high end minicards, stickerBooks, postercards, business and greeting cards with Moo.com.
     </p>
     <p>
          If you know of any other print or publishing APIs I should add to the list, let me know.

     <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/ifthisthenthat/if-this-then-that.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I believe that <a title="REST" href="/buildingblocks/restful_api.php">REST</a> and <a title="JSON" href="/2011/01/27/api-technology-json/">JSON</a> are breaking up the web, into smaller more understandable, re-usable, mashable pieces that potentially anyone can use, even non-developers.<br />
     <br />
     <span>I have written several posts on how tools like <a title="API Explorers" href="/2011/03/24/explorers-open-api-access-beyond-developers/">API explorers</a> and standards like <a title="oEmbed" href="/2011/04/06/allow-api-users-to-embed-content-with-oembed/">oEmbed</a> are making APIs accessible by non-developers.  And I’m always on the look out for new ideas, for new ways to arm the masses with tools that take advantage of APIs.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>Evolving on a piece I wrote a couple a months ago about a <a title="Widget Builder For APIs" href="/2011/06/22/widget-builder-environment-for-apis/">Widget Builder Environment for APIs</a>, I was envisioning taking Yahoo Pipes to the next level, add in better API support with OAuth, and make it much more simpler to use.  I did not get much time to think about it before <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey</a> introduced me to <a title="if this then that" href="http://ifttt.com/dashboard">if this then that</a> (ifttt).  </span><br />
     <br />
     <span>ifttt allows you to creates tasks.  Tasks are defined like this: when something happens (this) then do something else (that).</span>
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>this (triggers) -</strong> The this part of a task is the Trigger. Some example Triggers are "if I'm tagged in a photo on Facebook" or "if I tweet on Twitter." 
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>that (actions) -</strong> The that part of a task is the Action. Some example Actions are "then send me a text message" or "then create a status message on Facebook." 
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/ifthisthenthat/ifttt-Dashboard.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /><span>Triggers and Actions come from Channels. Channels are the services and devices we use every day, such as:  Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Email, Phone Call or Weather.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>You can put one channel's trigger together with another channel's action to create a task that runs every 15 minutes and can be turned on and off.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>Channels are made possible because these services have APIs.  ifttt does a remarkable job at simplifying this in a way, I never even imagined, and allows any user to take advantage of two APIs, apply meaningful business logic, and automate the task to run regularly.  </span><br />
     <br />
     <span>What really makes it cool is you can save tasks as “recipes” and share them with friends making this type of API usage and automation a potentially very social thing. </span><br />
     <br />
     <span>Right now it appears that the ifttt team creates the new channels that are available.  Think of the possibilitis if they opened it up to developers to build their own channels and recipes, and created a marketplace of these API automation recipes?  </span><br />
     <br />
     <span> <a title="if this then that" href="http://ifttt.com/dashboard">if this then that</a> (ifttt) is pretty cool!  I will be playing with more and incorporating into my daily operations, and see if we can make it stick.</span>

        <p>
     <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/weather-underground/Weather-Underground-weather-api-logo.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>At <a href="http://disrupt.techcrunch.com">TechCrunch DISRUPT</a>, this week in San Francisco, the <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/">Weather Underground</a> launched a new Weather API platform that provides developers with real-time access to in-depth weather data.
</p>
<p>
     The <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/">Weather Underground Weather API</a> provides access to data from more than 19,000 users contributing local observations from personal weather stations, providing up-to-the-minute weather conditions for the most finely targeted areas.
</p>
<p>
     The Weather API is RESTful with responses available in a JSON format, with access free for developers making 500 requests per day, and paid tiers for requests starting at 5K requests per month up to 1M requests per month.
</p>
<p>
     <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/weather-underground/Wunderground-Weather-API.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>"Weather Underground already distributes its weather data to many of the world’s leading media companies, weather applications and smaller web properties," said <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/alanswx">Alan Steremberg</a>, President and co-Founder of Weather Underground. "Our new self-service API platform will open up our data to thousands more developers working on web and mobile programs, big and small."
</p>
<p>
     The Weather Underground provides a very robust developers area allowing developers to signup, manage their keys and choose the appropriate pricing plan. They provide the necessary API documentation and code samples to get up and going, and even throw in some analytics showing your access and usage of the API.

        <span class="post-date">12 Sep 2011</span>
        <p>
     <a href="http://onebusaway.org/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/onebusaway/OneBusAway.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a>The response to Sundays post about the <a title="Need for More Transit APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/09/11/the-need-for-city-transit-apis/">Need for More Transit APIs</a> was impressive.  I receive quite a few emails and tweets about other APIs, and it started a <a title="good discussion on Hacker News" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2984807">good discussion on Hacker News</a>. Adding more targets for my <a title="public transit API" href="http://apievangelist.com/industries/public_transit.php">public transit API</a> research.<br />
     <br />
     <span>While doing my research, I just finished looking at <a href="http://onebusaway.org/">OneBusAway</a>, a provider of real-time transit information for the Puget Sound region.  The API was started by University of Washington students to support research on improving the usability of public transportation.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>At first look, OneBusAway seems like the start of a great model for other city and regional transit API initiatives to follow. </span><br />
     <br />
     <span>First they start with a RESTful API providing data about transit agencies, routes, arrivals, stops and tripping planning, using an application key for authentication and all the documentation and tools you need to successfully integrate with the API.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>Next OneBusAway provides a very complete list of tools to make it easier to use public transit</span>
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Web</strong> - A map-based web interface for finding stops, routes, and real-time arrival information.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Phone</strong> - A touch-tone phone interface for real-time arrival information.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>SMS</strong> - A text-messaging interface for real-time arrival information.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>iPhone</strong> - A native OneBusAway client for iPhones, with location-aware features.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Android </strong>- A native OneBusAway client for Android phones, with location-aware and notification features.
     </li>
     <li>Windows Phone 7 - A native OneBusAway client for Windows Phone 7 phones.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Mobile Web</strong> - Real-time arrival information optimized for mobile web browsers and text-only web browsers.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Explore</strong> - The Explore Tool lets you search for nearby restaurants, businesses, parks, and other amenities that are easily accessible by public transit.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     <span>In addition to providing a API and a full set of interfaces for accessing data from the API, they open-source it all, which means they release all the code that powers OneBusAway, for anyone to use.   That includes their <a title="iPhone App" href="http://code.google.com/p/onebusaway-iphone">iPhone</a> and <a title="Android App" href="http://code.google.com/p/seattle-bus-bot/">Android</a> mobile applications, letting other developers take advantage of all the work that's been put into OneBusAway.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>The OneBusAway website is very simple, yet contains all the essential tools and information any local transit would need to be successful.  Before hacking on the transit API and mobile tools for your local community I recommend taking a look at OneBusAway site for pointers.</span>

        <span class="post-date">11 Sep 2011</span>
        <p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/public-transit/transit-1.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><span id="internal-source-marker_0.029792157467454672">I’m working on some more stories around municipal data APIs, based upon two stories I found recently, where developers took it upon themselves to scrape data, launch APIs, and build mobile tools around local municipal transit data:</span>
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Madison Transit API" href="http://www.smsmybus.com/api/">Madison Transit API</a></strong> - Greg Tracy of Madison, WI has a <a title="great story on his journey" href="http://www.gregtracy.com/56599543">great story on his journey</a> to build a simple SMS app and ended building an entire API.  Greg wanted an SMS app that could deliver real-time arrival estimates, to meet his needs as a commuter.  After much pain scraping the Madison Transit site for data, he felt he should prevent others from having to do the same, and published an API around his data.  But Greg also wanted to find a way to contribute to the larger mission of opening up a public dataset to make it more accessible, opening up opportunities for his communities to operate more efficiently.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Swedish Train API" href="http://tagtider.net/api/">Swedish Train API</a></strong> - Erik Pettersson did the same thing in Sweden.  In his frequent travels as a freelancer, Erik was frustrated by the lack of information available, leaving him often sitting at a station wondering when the next train was.  From this frustration, Erik created a simple SMS service where travelers can text their train number, and receive updates on delayed arrivals, departures or even track changes at given stations.  His data was scraped from the Swedish Transport Administration, and in a year of operation, the API has spawned other applications for iOS, Android and Windows Mobile.  
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     <span>I still haven't fully flushed out my stories around both these municipal APIs, but it sure smells like an opportunity for some tech companies to get involved.  You a captured audience of commuters across the globe, needing more information about their daily bus, train and subway.  This need is so great, tech savvy commuters are scraping and building their own systems to meet this need.  </span><br />
     <br />
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/public-transit/transit-2.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><span>I know Google is stepping up to serve this space with <a title="Google Maps API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html">Google Maps</a> and <a title="Google Transit" href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/landing/transit/#mdy">Google Transit</a>.  They even have released the <a title="Google Transit Feed Specification" href="http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html">General Transit Feed Specification</a>, to help define a common format for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information.  But I think their are huge opportunities for companies to step up and coordinate transit APIs, at the country or regional level, and also for developers to provide local resources for "acquiring" of local data, understanding local constraints, and be the overall contact for a specific locale.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>With a clear problem defined, a captured audience rapidly adopting mobile technology, and a developer resource that is willing to invest time and resources to build out APIs, mobile and web apps, and create data visualizations--it just seems like an API industry that is in need of some leadership and coordination.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>Do you know of other municipal data API stories?  <a title="Let Me Know" href="/contact.php">Let me know</a>.</span>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/09/10/beyond-the-social-experiment-jonathans-card-is-the-new-gift-card-economy/">Beyond the Social Experiment Jonathans Card is the New Gift Card Economy</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Sep 2011</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.starbucks.com/card" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Jonathans-Card/starbucks-gift-card-300x229.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I followed the <a title="Jonathans Card Social Experiment" href="http://jonathanstark.com/card/">Jonthan&rsquo;s Card Socal Experiment</a> closely.  The whole time I had an entry on my to do list, to write a story about it.  I never successfully found an angle I could get behind, then <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Audrey</a> said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just write about he tech behind it?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Great idea!  Jonathan&rsquo;s Card is interesting as a social or marketing experiment, but I am more interested in the technology that was used to make it happen,  not just the social experiment.</p>
<p>It all starts with an image of Jonathan&rsquo;s Starbucks Card.  But it took the mobility of the smart phone to be able to display the image of his sard and purchase a coffee at your local Starbucks.</p>
<p>An image and your smart phone are essential technology in this experiment, but none of this would be possible without the <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/card" target="_blank">Starbucks Card program</a>.  Starbucks allows anyone to purchase and add money to the balance of the card as long as you know the card number, and the site also allows you to see charges made against the card.</p>
<p><a href="http://jonathanstark.com/card/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Jonathans-Card/jonathans-card-image.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>The Starbucks Card is the central ingredient in this experiment, but Twitter also plays an important role.   Jonathan uses Twitter as a central messaging channel, and ultimately an API for the Johnathan&rsquo;s Card Experiment.  He wrote a bot that scrapes the Starbucks site for the card balance and posts it to Twitter, whenever anything is charged to the Starbucks Card.</p>
<p>Twitter is also being used by the community participating in this &ldquo;social experiment&rdquo;.  Twitter allows them to tweet at @jonathanscard adding to the Twitter data stream.  Also, some innovative developer particpated by adding graphing apps on top of the @jonathanscard Twitter stream, that provided visualisations for the experiment.</p>
<p>Additionally, to provide easier access for developers, Jonathan whipped up a simple read only API providing insight into the experiment in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Balances</strong> - Returns the card balance for every minute of the day</li>
<li><strong>Latest Activity </strong>- Returns the most recent card balance with a timestamp indicating when it was retrieved. Under normal circumstances, the balance will be less than a minute old.</li>
<li><strong>Changes</strong> - Returns balance changes with delta amounts.</li>
<li><strong>Summary</strong> - Returns aggregate numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you I see a model for gift card providers to take advantage of when it comes to their gift card programs. &nbsp;So I took a quick look at the gift card landscape, and immediately you have all the big retail players:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Amazon Gift Cards" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/gc">Amazon Gift Cards</a></li>
<li><a title="Walmart" href="http://www.walmart.com/cp/Gift-Cards/96894">Walmart</a></li>
<li><a title="Target" href="http://www.target.com/c/GiftCards/-/N-5xsxu">Target</a></li>
<li><a title="Best Buy" href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Electronics/Gift-Cards/cat09000.c?id=cat09000">Best Buy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Since a gift card is just another version of a credit card, the leading credit card companies have gift cards:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Prepaid Visa" href="http://usa.visa.com/personal/cards/prepaid/visa_gift_card.html">Prepaid Visa</a></li>
<li><a title="American Express Gift Cards" href="https://www.americanexpress.com/gift-cards/">American Express</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Then there are a couple gift card only sites, providing access to existing gift card programs and private label and custom git cards:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="GiftCards.com" href="http://www.giftcards.com/">GitCards.com</a></li>
<li><a title="Gift Card Mall" href="https://www.giftcardmall.com/">Gift Card Mall</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is clear when you walk into any grocery store, that gift cards are here to stay, and are a new part of our economy.  Jonathans card is more a demonstration of how technology like Twitter, smart phones and APIs can be added to gift cards, and create a more social and mobile gift card economy.</p>
<p>Think how this experiment would work in more trusted and closed situations, like your son or daughter going to college and the entire family, including grandparents, aunts and uncles can contribute to a relatives life using gift cards, Twitter, APIS and their smart phone.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Sep 2011</span>
        <p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/water-drop.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><span id="internal-source-marker_0.5108589599840343">Someone asked me about APIs dealing with water and utilities a couple weeks ago.  So I dove in to see what I could find related to APIs for city, county and state water management.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>First I came cross, what sees like a pretty good model for city water services with the <a title="Wellington NZ City Water Service Pipes" href="http://www.data.govt.nz/dataset/show/2115">Wellington NZ City Water Service Pipes</a>.  The Wellington Water Service API provides programmatic access to water and drainage data to assist in planning works that are in proximity to water and drainage infrastructure.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>Next the Emery Water Conservancy District in central Utah provides sensor data from weather, canal, reservoir, pond and river monitoring sites via the <a title="MetriDyne API" href="http://www.ewcd.org/about/metridyne-api/">MetriDyne API</a>.  The <a title="MetriDyne API" href="/apis/metridyne_api.php">MetriDyne API</a> provides immediate access to data from these sites, leading to better and timely information leads to better water management.</span><br />
     <br />
     <a title="Water and Environmental Hub" href="/apis/water_and_environmental_hub_api.php"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/api/The-Water-and-Environment-Hub.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a><span>Then in Canada there is a pretty interesting initiative to create an open source web platform that will aggregate, federate, and connect water data and information enabling users to access, mashup, analyze, model and interpret water data, information, issues and opportunities, called the <a title="Water and Environmental Hub" href="/apis/water_and_environmental_hub_api.php">Water and Environmental Hub</a>.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>That was really it, when it came to water related APIs.  They are all three really great models when it comes to looking at the future of water management using APIs. I would throw in another API i found from NASA called the MODAPS Web Services which provides an API to access the data products provided by the Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS), providing programmatic access to atmosphere, weather and ocean data.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>There are also some software solutions for water, energy and utility management that include APIs:</span>
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="ArcFM Solution Overview" href="http://www.telvent-gis.com/products/">ArcFM Solution Overview</a></strong> - maintenance of electric, gas, fiber optic, water and wastewater facility
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="WaterObjects.NET" href="http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Products/WaterGEMS/WaterObjects.NET-Bentley.htm">WaterObjects.NET</a></strong> - Gives you complete and programmatic access to Bentley’s water modeling technology, from numerical methods and water modeling capabilities to mapping, data management, and result presentation features
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     <span>Beyond data and software for water management, there is the water, weather and environmental device and API company HoboLink, which has the <a title="HoboLink Web Services API" href="http://www.onsetcomp.com/hobolink-web-services-hlws">HOBOlink® Web Services API</a>, an API that enables anyone to easily integrate energy and environmental data from the comapny's devices.  Think of the future here, with millions of devices tracking weather, water and our environment.</span><br />
     <br />
     <a href="http://www.onsetcomp.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hobolink/hobo_u30_weatherstation.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a><span>Although its not just environmental monitoring devices that foretell this flood of water management APIs.  When you take a moment to look at the amount of water related data available on the web, there is a clear sign of the potential growth in need for water management APIs.  Take a look at the <a title="California Department of Water Resources" href="http://www.water.ca.gov/waterdatalibrary/index.cfm">California Department of Water Resources</a>, Water Data Library.  You can find datasets on water quality, groundwater levels and snow pack in near real-time or as historical data.   You can query the data on their site, but there is no real API for pulling, parsing and crunching this data to build mobile and web applications and data visualizations.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span>Water is essential to not just the future of business, but humanity.  The need to manage water in real-time is only going to grow, and there are tremendous opportunities for API deployment in this space when it comes to water and utility management at the city, county, state and federal level.</span>

        <div><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/matrix-pics/washington-crossing-the-delaware-cropped.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /><span id="internal-source-marker_0.13283396931365132">Have you ever tried to get data from a government agencies website? &nbsp;Often, when you find what your looking for, its in a PDF format. &nbsp;Not really a data friendly format. &nbsp;If your lucky, you will find a spreadsheet, but usually they are laid out in a report format and not meant for actual data portability.</span><br /><br /><span>I have a personal obsession for finding, crunching and making sense out of local, state, and federal government data. &nbsp;I'm willing to do a lot of work to derive meaning about how our government works. &nbsp;I personally feel its my duty to lend a hand, but while doing so, I often get overwhelmed parsing PDF files and often have to rearrange data by hand, or just give up on my project entirely.</span><br /><br /><span>I've always blamed the the "government bureaucracy for this--it is some sort of conspiracy to hide what is really going on. However, recently I'm beginning to change my tune. &nbsp;I'm getting a feeling that maybe it goes deeper then with government operations. &nbsp;Its the technology they are given. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>While trying to understand more about the technology our government uses, I came across a <a title="post by Matt MacDonald" href="http://www.mattmacdonald.com/">post by Matt MacDonald</a>. &nbsp;Matt is trying to get data from his local town of <a title="Watertown, MA" href="http://www.ci.watertown.ma.us/">Watertown, MA</a>. &nbsp;After looking around he encountered the same issues. &nbsp;All he could get were PDFs and Excel "reports", which seems to be the common language of government when comes to data portability.</span><br /><br /><span>After not getting what he was looking for he went to the source, the company that built the tools his town used, <a title="TylerTech" href="http://www.tylertech.com/">TylerTech</a>. &nbsp;TylerTech builds systems for municipalities to manage services ranging from property taxes to school information systems.</span><br /><br /><span>Matt reached out to TylerTech, and asked whether or not they had an API for their systems available for their town, but he&rsquo;s just gotten a couple cookie cutter responses, and no real information. &nbsp;&nbsp;I reached out to TylerTech for comment on this story, and have not received a response.</span><br /><br /><span>As I said I'm changing my tune about who is to blame. &nbsp;The average government or school administration can only work with what is given to them. &nbsp;In the case of Watertown, its Munis from TylerTech.</span><br /><br /><span><a title="TylerTech" href="http://www.tylertech.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/tylertech-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>TylerTech is 50 year old company with almost 300 Million in annual revenue, servicing a number of cities across the country. &nbsp;The only mention of an API on the TylerTech site is part of their Eagle Product Suite:</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span>&nbsp;</span><em><br /></em><em>Eagle Software is engineered with XML Web Services in mind &mdash; unlike many systems, where XML transactions are an afterthought. Taking advantage of open standards, WSDL and SOAP, Eagle Software can expose a robust API &mdash; simplifying external system integration with Java, .NET, VB, C++, C#, COBOL and others.</em></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>Without talking with TylerTech this appears to be an add-on suite, and not a standard offering. &nbsp;Web Services need to be brought into the foreground, and made standard in all installations. &nbsp;Not an afterthought, or add-on.</span><br /><br /><span>When it comes to public data we need to have a high standard, and we need to expect more out of the technology that is purchased with our tax dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;In this time time of economic crisis our municipalities are already overburdened with doing their regular job, they can't be expected to to do extra work, and even better, they could use the help of citizens like myself and Matt, who want to help make sense of data, build apps, and help make government more efficient.</span><br /><br /><span><a title="Watertown, MA" href="http://www.ci.watertown.ma.us/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/watertown-ma-sign.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>We can't do it without access to the right data, and APIs are the perfect way for the government to share data in real-time. &nbsp;They need to be given tools and training that allow them share and publish data in real-time without extra effort. &nbsp;PDF is not Portable Data Format...its a Portable Document Format. &nbsp;XML export is a start, but it still just an export....its not an API. &nbsp;With an API, municipalities can share data with the public in a self-service way, that still allows the government to understand who is accessing data, and how they are using it.</span><br /><br /><span>I look to technology companies like <a title="TylerTech" href="http://www.tylertech.com/">TylerTech</a> to lead, and provide our government with the tools they need to open data, and let the rest of the tech community build web and mobile applications for the government, and crunch data to help them be more efficient, and make the most of taxpayers money.</span></div>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/09/05/virtualized-document-printing-apis/">Virtualized Document Printing APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Sep 2011</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.mimeo.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>Even though I cover the entire industry around APIs here on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, I also am the API Evangelist for <a title="Mimeo Connect" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;Mimeo is a printing API that allows you to print a wide variety of business documents, using your Mimeo.com account. &nbsp;Its pretty powerful stuff, if you think about it, an API that is connected to 3 print facilities. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The API seems pretty straightforward at first glance, but developers seem to be encountering three major obstacles:</span></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Mimeo.com Accounts</strong> - Users don&rsquo;t like having to get a developer account as well as sandbox and live Mimeo.com accounts to work with the API</li>
<li><strong>Mimeo Documents</strong> - Developers don&rsquo;t really have time to build and define the documents before integration, they just want to print a specific document, and pass some settings to change it up.</li>
<li><strong>Sandbox and Live Environments </strong>- It is great that Mimeo has sandbox and live environments, but developers were expected to maintain two separate environments, just to use the system.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://mimeoconnect.3scale.net/wiki/poster-printing-api"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/posters-sample.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a> <span>These three areas proved to be the difference between some users adopting, and others walking away. &nbsp;There was too much work in navigating the world of Mimeo accounts and documents. &nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t hard if your already a Mimeo web to print user, but if your a developer you just want to print. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>So I created four virtualized print APIs. &nbsp;&nbsp;I took a REST framework and deployed four separate &ldquo;<a title="Document Printing APIs" href="http://mimeoconnect.3scale.net/">document printing APIs</a>&rdquo;:</span></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Poster Printing API" href="../../2011/09/05/api-stack-large-format-printing-with-the-mimeo-connect-poster-printing-api/">Poster Printing API</a></li>
<li><a title="Flyer &amp; Brochure Printing API" href="../../2011/09/05/api-stack-single-sheet-printing-with-the-mimeo-connect-flyer-&amp;-brochure-printing-api/">Flyer &amp; Brochure Printing API</a></li>
<li><a title="Card Printing API" href="../../2011/09/05/api-stack-card-printing-with-the-mimeo-connect-card-printing-api/">Card Printing API</a></li>
<li><a title="Spiral Notebook API" href="../../2011/09/05/api-stack-bound-document-printing-with-the-mimeo-connect-spiral-notebook-printing-api/">Spiral Notebook API</a></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Then using <a title="3Scale API Management Solution" href="../../serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale self-service API management solution</a> I deployed an API area to handle documentation, forum and developer registration and API key management. &nbsp;Each API has seven methods for ordering print documents:</span></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Proof (POST)</li>
<li>Proof (GET)</li>
<li>Quote (GET)</li>
<li>Shipping Options (GET)</li>
<li>Order Quote (GET)</li>
<li>Place Order (POST)</li>
<li>Order Status (GET)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://mimeoconnect.3scale.net/wiki/spiral-notebook-printing-api"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/Spiral-Notebook-Example-Image.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a> <span>All a developer has to do is <a title="register for a set of keys" href="http://mimeoconnect.3scale.net/plans">register for a set of keys</a>, grab a code sample and get to work. &nbsp;They don&rsquo;t have to setup a Mimeo account or build the documents they want to use. &nbsp;If they want a poster, they use the <a title="Poster Printing API" href="http://mimeoconnect.3scale.net/wiki/poster-printing-api">Poster Printing API</a> and pass the size, paper, mounting and lamination settings, along with the URL of the PDF they want to print.</span><br /><br /><span>These four APIs represent a process I will use to virtualize other API instances on top of the Mimeo Connect REST API, and possibly other APIs too. &nbsp;It is pretty quick for me to bundle the data, settings, and code for a new virtualized API and deliver an entirely new type of document printing API. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This will give me an agile way to play around with new configurations of APIs, measure their response using the <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale API</a> analytics, and decide whether or not I put more resources into an specific type of API.</p>

</ul>
<p><span>I now had a simple RESTful API, that had self-service documentation, app key registration, forum, and support. &nbsp;I received emails when new developers registered, could track how much they used, and turn off access when needed.</span><br /><br /><span>I was open for business, using the CodeIgniter tools as a RESTful framework and 3Scale as API management solution I was able to deploy and manage my APIs on an existing Amazon EC2 instance for free, with minimal work, and the platform will scale as my APIs get more usage.</span></p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Sep 2011</span>
        <p>
     <a title="National Archives" href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/uk-national-archives-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>The <a title="National Archives" href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/">National Archives</a> has <a title="published a new API" href="http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2011/09/02/247784/National-Archives-releases-public-application-programming-interface-for-11m.htm">published a new API</a>, as part of an ongoing program to get more public records online, according to <a title="ComputerWeekly.com" href="http://www.computerweekly.com">ComputerWeekly.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
     The <a title="National Archives API" href="http://labs.nationalarchives.gov.uk/wordpress/index.php/2011/09/the-national-archives-api/">National Archives API</a> provides programmatic access to over 11 million records from the discovery service catalogue, broken down into a seven-level hierarchical structure:
</p>
<ul>
     <li>Department - Government department, agency or body that creates the records
     </li>
     <li>Division - Administrative section of a department
     </li>
     <li>Series - The main grouping of records with a common function or subject
     </li>
     <li>Sub-series - Smaller groupings of records with a common function or subject
     </li>
     <li>Sub sub-series - Smaller groupings of records with a common function or subject
     </li>
     <li>Piece - A piece can be a box, volume or file
     </li>
     <li>Item - A part of a piece. It can be a bundle, a single document, a sub-file, etc.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Access is provided without restriction or charging for content, but costs $3.50 per document to retrieve the same records online through the website.
</p>
<p>
     Aleksandr Drozdov, architect for the National Archives, said they have been speaking with academic historians to help them find ways to use the API in their research, and they are very interested in access to the archives in a programmatic way.
</p>
<p>
     According to Computer Weekly the National Archives is also working an e-commerce system. Since private companies have been paying the National Archives 52M since 2002 for the digitization of paper records they could then resell through websites, the API and associated e-commerce system are a perfect fit.
</p>
<p>
     The move by the National Archive may prove a great model for other institutions to not only open up access to their collections, but provide new ways to derive revenue from collections, and allow for commercial use of images, documents and other items that have been historically very hard to access.

        <span class="post-date">01 Sep 2011</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/infochimps/infochimps-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /><a title="Infochimps has delivered a new Geo API" href="http://blog.infochimps.com/2011/08/30/geo-api/">Infochimps has delivered a new Geo API</a> that brings together geographic data from multiple sources, connects it with a standardized schema, and delivers it to developers through a single API.</p>
<p>When pulling geo data from APIs, developer may not always get the most complete data, but they just deal with it, because we don't always have the time to pull data from multiple APIs. InfoChimps does this for developers, making it possible to have the best data from many sources.</p>
<p>Once InfoChimps downloads the data from multiple sources, they tie the data together, making relationships and connections between disparate data, using the Infochimps Simple Schema (ICSS). So no matter what the original data source is, there is a consistent, complete and expressive description of a collection of related data its associated assets.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/infochimps/infochimps-geo-api-map.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" />InfoChimps doesn't stop at downloading and standardizing access to this geo data, they also tackle displaying potentially large volumes of data. When you look at data from a large geographic region, the amount of data to display for users can very large. Developers are faced with questions of how to group and summarize for display. The Infochimps Geo API provides a summarizer feature that will group data based on intelligent clusters, making the data easier to display, and more meaningful.</p>
<p>Next InfoChimps also provides multiple ways to query geo data, allowing developers to query based upon latitude and longitude, as well as other geographic locators like street address, bounding box or any dimension that can be mapped back to a location. This type of geo data querying opens up a whole new ways for developers to empower their users to discover.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/infochimps/geo_api_chart.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />Then if aggregating from multiple sources, providing a standardized schema, intelligent summaries, and multiple query options wasn't enough, they are also pushing the traditional notions of what is geo data. They've included Wikipedia articles as sources, and opened up the possibility for tying any data set to a location, using the <a title="Infochimps Geo API" href="http://infochimps.com/apis/geo">Infochimps Geo API</a>.</p>
<p>InfoChimps approach to the Geo API, shows they just get it. They aren't just pushing data sets via an API because data is valuable, like I see with other data marketplaces and API providers. They are actually solving data problems for developers and actually enriching our mobile and web apps with quality geo data, and making a better user experience.</p>

<p>With the new <a title="Infochimps Geo API" href="http://www.infochimps.com/apis/geo">Infochimps Geo API</a>, Infochimps provides some very important features for developers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Aggregation of data from multiple sources</li>
<li>Tying together with a simple schema</li>
<li>Intelligent clustering and summarization</li>
<li>Provide a flexible query interface</li>
<li>Allow linking with other data sets</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all problems developers face when working with Geo data, but they are also problems that are encountered when working with other data sets.</p>
<p>The future of delivering data via APIs is not just about providing access to the data via a simple RESTful interface (though that is a great start). It is also about actually solving the common problems developers face when integrating the data into their applications.</p>
<p>I think InfoChimps approach provides a model for other data APIs, and shows they have a viable business model that makes them more than just a data marketplace.</p>

        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-Google-Translate.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />Back in May <a title="Google deprecated the free version of the Google Translate API" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/05/spring-cleaning-for-some-of-our-apis.html">Googledeprecatedthe free version of the Google Translate API</a>, and pissed off a lot of people along the way. I talked about <a title="building your business around Google or any other APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/28/building-your-business-around-google-or-any-other-apis/">building your business around Google or any other APIs</a>, and even suggested that Google offer a paid version of the API instead of just shutting down.<p></p>
Today <a title="Google introduced a paid version of the Google Translate API" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/08/paid-version-of-google-translate-api.html">Google introduced a paid version of the Google Translate API</a> that provides a programmatic interface to access Google's machine translation technology, supporting translations in over 50 languages.<p></p>
The paid version of <a title="Google Translate API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/language/">Google Translate API</a> costs $20 per million (M) characters of text translated (or approximately $0.05/page, assuming 500 words/page), and allows up to 50 M chars/month.<p></p>
Google has give a limit of 100K chars / day until 12/1/2011 for developers who had already created projects in the API console that used the Translate API version 2 prior to today.<p></p>
It sounds like Google has decided on a solid business model that will keep the translation API alive, and allow developers to commercially integrate the service into their applications. Google Tranlsate API is now integrated into the <a title="Google API Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/">Google API Console</a>, and is now one of four Google APIs that have pricing / billing frameworks to support them.<p></p>
Google could have done a better PR job by deprecating the free version of the API at the same time as offering a paid version, but I think Google is trying to figure out how to manage and monetize their APIs just like the rest of us.

The post made me think about the API space and <a title="smart API documentation like Posterous" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/deploying-smarter-api-documentation/">smart API documentation like Posterous</a>, and <a title="Masherys new I/O docs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/08/02/mashery-open-sources-their-api-io-docs/">Masherys new I/O docs for APIs</a>.

<a title="Masherys I/O docs" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/07/26/mashery-delivers-smarter-api-documentation/">Masherys I/O docs</a>, and smart API documentation allow developers to make API calls from within the documentation, making learning about APIs more interactive. This is a great approach to help developers learn about APIs, but I think we can go even further.<p></p>
Can we make API documentation even more personalized? Can my API documentation know which language I'm using? Can code samples be in my native language? Should the documentation automatically know whether I'm making a web or mobile app?<p></p>
The information needed to make the documentation smarter could be gathered when developers apply for an application key. Then documentation can then be dynamically tailored specifically for each application.<p></p>
Quality API documenation is a huge stumbling point for many developers. How can we make documentation better meet developers needs? Where else can we personalize the APIdocumentationexperience?

        <span class="post-date">24 Aug 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/ipad-in-the-cockpit.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I just finished the NYTimes article, <a title="United Pilots Get iPad Flight Manuals" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/united-airlines-to-give-all-pilots-ipad-flight-manuals/">United Pilots Get iPad Flight Manuals</a>. This follows <a title="Alaska Airlines adopting the iPad" href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/228924/ipad_enters_the_cockpit_on_alaska_air.html">Alaska Airlines adopting the iPad</a>, and <a title="Delta Airlines testing the iPad" href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/08/17/delta_airlines_now_testing_apple_ipad_as_electronic_flight_bag.html">Delta Airlines testing the iPad</a> as a viable alternative to on-board manuals.<p></p>
I don't think of the iPad as enterprise tool. It is a consumer tool, so this type of large scale adoption of the iPad at United, Alaska and potentially Delta says a lot. These major companies have made decisions that tablets, more specifically the iPad, and mobile applications are the future of their business operations.<p></p>
These applications are driven by APIs. APIs provide the flight, weather and other real-time information that drive these mobile applications, and make the iPad a viable tool in the cockpit.<p></p>
The growth in APIs over the last 6 years has been driven by social media and cloud computing, and more recently the iPhone and Android led mobile revolution. A large portion of these movements are driven by a grassroots, consumer dominated user base, outside of the traditional IT ranks. Mainstream enterprise and business IT are just now waking up to the potential of the social, and mobile Internet operating in the clouds, and the role APIs play in this.<p></p>
It shows that the enterprise are coming around, and APIs aren't just the latest trend, and more companies will be deploying systems and devices that depend on APIs, to get business done.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/08/16/reinventing-pearson-publishing-using-apis/">Re-inventing Pearson Publishing using APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Aug 2011</span>
        <a title="Pearson Plug &amp; Play Developer Platform" href="http://developer.pearson.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pearson/Pearson-Plug-And-Play-API-Screenshot.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>We hear about the struggles of newspapers, magazines, and book publishers to stay relevant in the digital age on almost a daily basis these days. Many of these publishers are sitting on a treasure chest of content, but are unable to understand how to unlock them -- to make the content accessible in a way that allows them to retain control, adhere to existing licensing agreements, and make money in a world quickly being dominated by the iPad and Kindle.<p></p>
For those of us who live and breathe APIs, its easy for us to understand the power of a simple RESTful interace when it comes to content, but for publishing dinosaurs, it is much harder. I wrote a post back in May about the <a title="publishing company Pearson, looking to unlock their content with a new API platform" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/10/pearson-plans-api-platform-to-unlock-content/">publishing company Pearson, looking to unlock their content with a new API platform</a>. Pearson made good on their promise, and launched the <a title="Pearson Plug &amp; Play Developer Platform" href="http://developer.pearson.com/">Pearson Plug &amp; Play Platform</a> at the end of July. The platform includes three content APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pearson/Pearson-Plug-And-Play-API-iphone-app.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /><strong><a title="DK's Eyewitness London Travel Guide API" href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/Eyewitness%2520Guide%2520to%2520London/List%2520Guide%2520Entries%2520in%2520Category/overview">DK's Eyewitness London Travel Guide API</a>:</strong> Provides information about hotels, restaurants, bars and shops in London, plus insider tips on everything from where to find the best markets and traditional pubs to great attractions for children.</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Financial Times (FT) Press API" href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/FT%2520Press/List%2520All%2520Books/overview">Financial Times (FT) Press API</a>:</strong> Provides access to over 500 articles on business, management, marketing and science from award winning authors who deliver timely and authoritative content.</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English API" href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/Longman%2520Dictionary/Get%2520Entry/overview">Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English API</a>:</strong> Rich multimedia dictionary containing over 230,000 words, phrases and meanings plus examples and pronunciations as MP3 and pictures.</li>
</ul>
At first glance these APIs may not seem like much. There are other travel, business, and dictionary APIs available already. But for a publishing power house like Pearson, this is a big move. These APIs will provide a model for how the publisher prepares, gives access, controls and monetizes content for any new material as well as their vast archives, in the future.<p></p>
Take a look at the DK's Eyewitness London Travel Guide. You can purchase the guide and other related information on the <a title="TravelDK / London Website" href="http://traveldk.com/london">TravelDK / London website</a>, a model which has obviously proven lucrative for the company. But it is still a pretty limited way to monetize your content. With an API the travel guide information is available as a database, allowing other publishers and app developers to access just the information they need to create rich user experiences on the web, tablets and mobile phones. While the printed travel guide provided a great model for the last couple decades, the monetization opportunities through an API are only limited by the imagination of app developers.<p></p>
APIs shed light, and provide access to content in ways that printed formats never could. Consumers can now access just a chapter, paragraph, sentence or a single photo from content without buying the whole book. Publishers can open up this access, while still maintaining control, and create entirely new ways of making money off entire collections or just the parts and pieces of their archives.<p></p>
I'm always skeptical of larger companies when it comes to understanding how to leverage the power of APIs, but from what I see, the Pearson Plug &amp; Play team has done a great job with their pioneering efforts in this space. They launched the essential building blocks for their API community using <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/10/apigee-api-services/">Apigee</a>, providing the basic tools developers are used to when working with an API. The team also launched with a diverse set of APIs that not only provide valuable content to developers, but also gives Pearson a good place to practice when it comes to serving up content via an API.<p></p>
What the Pearson Plug &amp; Play team is doing can't be easy, I imagine they are up against some seriously entrenched management not just at Pearson, but with their network of partners as well. I will be keeping any eye on the <a title="Pearson Plug &amp; Play Developer Platform" href="http://developer.pearson.com/">Pearson Plug &amp; Play Platform</a>, and see what lessons we can pull from what they are doing with their innovative content APIs.<p></p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/08/13/united-states-farmers-market-api/">United States Farmers Market API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2011</span>
        <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Farmers-Market-Data-US-Map.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I'm always on the lookout for innovative data sets and examples of APIs that provide value in ever-day life. APIs are often a very geeky thing, and I'm always trying to find examples of APIs that make sense to my mainstream audience, and help me explain what APIs are, and the value they can deliver.
<p></p>I found a story from <a title="John Mertens" href="http://twitter.com/#!/@mertonium">John Mertens</a> of <a title="Code for America" href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>, about <a title="building a famers market Api" href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/08/08/farmers-market-api/">building a Famers Market API</a>, which I think tells a great story about how anyone with a need, can take a valuable dataset and make it available using an API.
<p></p>Like many of us Mertens loves getting his fruit and vegetables from a local Farmers Market. He was new to the San Francisco area and was unsure how to find the local Farmers Market. After Googling he found the <a title="USDA web site which has a great web-application for searching for famers markets in the US" href="http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/">USDA web site which has a great web application to search for Farmers Markets in the United States</a>. It is a great tool, and they also allow you todownload a spreadsheet of the data, but there is no API to build an application on.
<p></p>So being a data geek (I totally understand), Merts felt compelled to liberate this data using an API, which he build using a couple of freely available technologies:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Exported the Famers Market dataset using the USDA export to excel
     </li>
     <li>Normalized the data using <a title="Google Refine" href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/">Google Refine</a>
     </li>
     <li>Uploaded it to a <a title="free couchdb instance" href="http://iriscouch.com/">free couchdb instance</a>
     </li>
     <li>Added a map using the open-source <a title="geocouch-utils" href="https://github.com/maxogden/geocouch-utils">geocouch-utils</a> CouchApp
     </li>
</ul>Mertens did all this for free. The data was freely available, the tools he used are free, and the hosting of the API is free as well. I'm not sure I'd depend on his API for commercial purposes, but it is a great demonstration how take a data-set and publish as an API, to fill a specific niche.
<p></p>Now anyone can build an application around Farmers Market data using his <a title="Farmers Market API" href="http://usda.iriscouch.com/farmers_markets/_design/geo/_spatiallist/geojson/full?bbox=-122.61248930742187,37.655669842383595,-122.24788054277343,37.83240550745524">Farmers Market API</a>.

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2011</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/google/Google-Plus-Platform-Blog-1.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Google just put up a new <a title="Google+ Platform Blog" href="http://googleplusplatform.blogspot.com/">Google+ Platform blog</a> today, to support the growing demand around their new social platform.<p></p>
Developers have been waiting for the release of the Google+ API, so they can get to work building Google+ applications. While Google did put up a<a title="Google+ developers signup form" href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/plusdevelopers/">Google+ developers signup form</a>, there has been no other word about access to the Google+ APIs.<p></p>
Apparently, todays launch of games on Google+ represents the first wave of developers using the Google+ APIs. Google chose to release the Google+ API to a small number of gaming partners so they could experiment, gather feedback and work the kinks out of the Google+ APIs before releasing it into the wild.<p></p>
It shows they are starting to allow developers into the Google+ APIs, but I am sure they are prioritizing their partners, and unless your a Zynga or a Popcap, I doubt you'll get early access.<p></p>
It seems wise of Google to open up access to game developers first, after the major success of the Facebook API platform was around gaming.
