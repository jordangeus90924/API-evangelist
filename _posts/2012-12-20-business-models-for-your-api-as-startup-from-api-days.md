{% include JB/setup %}<p>Here is a video of one of my talks from API Days in Paris, France where I walked through potential thoughts on business model for a hypothetical startup.Â I had a separate talk prepared, but after attending the first day I went and found a french cafe, drank a couple bottles of wine, took what I learned and produced this talk.If you want to see my slide deck from this talk, you can find a published version business for your API as a startup, using deck.js off my talks sections of API Evangelist.Thanks again to Faber Novel and Webshell for putting on such a great event, and producing these cool videos.</p>
