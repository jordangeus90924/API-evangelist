{% include JB/setup %}<p>Amazon sent me an email about the recent signing of the online sales tax law by California Governor Brown, which would force online retailers who have no physical presence in California, to collect the same levies as bricks-and-mortar stores.As a result of this, contracts with all California residents participating in the Amazon Associates Program are terminated effective, June 29, 2011.As I was writing up the story of this on kinlane.com, ad it got me thinking about the impact of this on API affiliate programs.Im tracking on various monetization strategies for APIs, and affiliate sales is one of them.</p>
