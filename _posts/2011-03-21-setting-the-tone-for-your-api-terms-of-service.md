<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/terms-legal.jpg" alt="" width="275" align="right" />I wanted to establish a base [Terms of Service][1] for my API area.

So I went and read the API terms of service from 15 top APIs

I found the opening paragraph says a lot about how a company approaches their API.

Here are the opening paragraphs for the top 15 API terms of service I came across:

**[Twitter][2]** Twitter maintains an open platform that supports the millions of people around the world who are sharing and discovering what's happening now. We want to empower our ecosystem partners to build valuable businesses around the information flowing through Twitter. At the same time, we aim to strike a balance between encouraging interesting development and protecting both Twitter's and users' rights.

So, we've come up with a set of Developer Rules of the Road ("Rules") that describe the policies and philosophy around what type of innovation is permitted with the content and information shared on Twitter.

**[Amazon Web Services][3]** Welcome to the Amazon Web Services site (the AWS Site). Amazon Web Services LLC and/or its affiliates (AWS) provides the AWS Site to you subject to the following terms of use (Terms of Use). By visiting the AWS Site, you accept the Terms of Use.

In addition, when you use any current or future AWS services, content or other materials, you also will be subject to the AWS Customer Agreement or other agreement governing your use of our services (the Agreement).
