<p>I am happy to assist you in the deployment of your API. There are many different ways to actually deploy an API, and I've seen most of the approaches in the monitoring of the space.</p>
<p>Not all teams have the resources necessary to stand up, and deploy an API internally, and I'm willing to bring the resources you ned to the table, and make sure it gets done.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I am what you are need, but I'm happy to explore with you. If I can't help you, maybe one of my network of partners can help. Choose the best channel to reach me, and drop me a line.</p>
<p>I looked forward to talking more.</p>
