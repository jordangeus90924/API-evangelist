[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twilio.PNG" alt="" width="250" align="right" />][1]The cloud communications platform [Twilio has a new API developer contest this week][2].

As usual they are looking for someone to build a killer app that uses the Twilio voice and SMS API.

This round they are looking for more, but first lets set the stage with the prizes:

  * A guaranteed seat on either the Cleveland, or Miami SXSW Startup Bus
  * A ticket to [SXSW Interactive][3], valued at $750
In addition to building a killer app, they are looking for someone to tweet, blog, record video, and generally represent Twilio on the bus.

Entries must be [submitted][4] by 11:59pm PT on Sunday February 27th.
