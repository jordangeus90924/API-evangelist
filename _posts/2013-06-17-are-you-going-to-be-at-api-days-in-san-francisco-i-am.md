{% include JB/setup %}<p>Coming on the heels of API Days Mediterranea in Madrid Spain, is the next event in the series, API Days San Francisco.We kicked off the API Days event series in Paris, at the end of last year, and now after the momentum in Spain, API Days has picked up enough speed to hop the ocean and land in the heart of technology.The lineup is pretty rockn, with talks from Runscope, SendGrid, Layer 7 Technologies, Netflix, Intel, Apigee, DotCloud, Stripe, Mashape, Mashery, 3Scale, Zapier, APISpark, Singly, Salesforce, SOA Software, Apiary.io, Fitbit, SAP, Mulesoft, Apiphay, Webshell, faberNovel, Reverb and AngelHack.The theme for API Days San Francisco is the API Economy, so it makes sense there are even VCs talking from True Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners and even Alex William from Techcrunch will be there.</p>
