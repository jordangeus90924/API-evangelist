[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/stack-overflow/Stack-Apps-Registration.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />][1]You want to make it as easy as possible for developers to get up and running with your [API][2].

You don't want developers to fumble around with lengthy registrations and approval processes.

Your API registration needs to be simple and self-service. [OpenID][3] is one way to do this.

[StackApps][4], the [Stack Overflow][5] API demonstrates this perfectly.

I wanted to see what was possible using the Stack Apps API. My objective is to integrate an API FAQ system with a Stack Overflow site.

I went to Stack Apps and clicked on registration. Stack Apps only gives OpenID for registration. They allow you to select from top providers like [Google][6] and [Facebook][7] or use your own OpenID provider.

With two clicks I was registered for a Stack Apps developer account, and with one more click I was registering my [Application][8] and getting my keys.

This is how easy you want to make it for developers to get up and going developing against your API. OpenID is the solution.
