{% include JB/setup %}<p>One API Iâ€™ve been watching grow and evolve from day one is the Pearson Developer Community.I first wrote about them when Peasron announced a new initiative to build an API platform that give developers access to the publishers content in May of 2011.Then in August 2011 they launched three APIs: Longman Dictionary - The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English is the flagship Longman dictionary FT Press - FT Press provides essential insights from the best business books and original writings by leading business thinkers Eyewitness Guides - The DK Eyewitness Travel Guides show you what others only tell you After Pearson got acquainted with the ins and outs of API evangelism, and supporting the Pearson developer community, they released two more APIs this year: Pearson Kitchen Manager - Pearson Kitchen Manager is a valuable resource for food enthusiasts and chefs alike, featuring a vast collection of recipes from bestselling Pearson textbooks of top culinary schools Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guides API - The best-selling Pearson Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guide series is the UKs premier quick reference, aide memoire support for health and social care students and professionals while in practice and studying It looks like Pearson is really finding a rhythm with identifying content to make available, as well as the right approach to deploying as APIs.They have 3 more high value publishing APIs available: Penguin Classics API - The Penguin English Library is a collection of 100 of the best novels ever written in the English Language.Classics like Jane Eyre, Dracula and Great Expectations dkimages API - The dkimages API is an encyclopaedic collection of 90,000 high-resolution images Peachpit Visual QuickStart Guides API - With more than 12 million copies in print, Visual QuickStart Guides have been a vital part of the computer book category for years That is a total of 8 APIs endpoints Pearson has made available via their developer center--providing some valuable text and image content that developers can use to build web and mobile apps.</p>
