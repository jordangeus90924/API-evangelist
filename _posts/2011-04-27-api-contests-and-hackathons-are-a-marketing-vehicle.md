{% include JB/setup %}<p>As Im identifying common building used by various API service providers to build their APIs and communities, there are two innovative tools Im seeing show up more often.API contestsand hackathons.API providers like Twilio and Netflix are using them to attract new users, and to generate buzz and innovation around their API.When Im out at events, educating business users about APIs, I often get asked about the viability of contests and hackathons to generate free code and applications for an API community.I think there is a common misconception amongst the business community that API owners can get away with not paying developers to build code and applications, by just framing what they want in the form of a contest or hackathon, and developers will all rally, and work for free.</p>
