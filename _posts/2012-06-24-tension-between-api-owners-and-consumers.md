{% include JB/setup %}<p>We’ve had a couple of new API ecosystem flare ups in the last week.one from LinkedIn and the other from Netflix.I’m still working on my thoughts about both of these, but in the meantime I cant help but think about the tension between API owners and their consumers.This tension doesn’t exist in all ecosystems, but seems default by nature in others.In these flare ups, I can’t help but empathize with both sides and see each others perspective: API Owners - This is my company, our resources and our brand.</p>
