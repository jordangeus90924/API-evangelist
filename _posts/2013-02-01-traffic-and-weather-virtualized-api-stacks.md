{% include JB/setup %}<p>I recently added the Traffic and Weather podcast to the right hand menu for everyone to enjoy.What John Sheehan (@johnsheehan ) and Steve Marx (@smarx) are doing on the podcast is SO needed in the API space, I highly recommend subscribing to the podcast in your itunes and listening regularly.I was honored to be critiqued in the podcast this week, where they “gently” disagreed with my post from earlier this week on my speculation around virtual API stacks.So I wanted to “gently” respond and help clarify.The first 60 seconds, pretty much sum up rebuttal, where they make my argument for me by saying IFTT and Zapier are already doing this?</p>
