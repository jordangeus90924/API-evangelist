If its your API, hopefully you have metrics established for every part of your API and supporting API area.<p>
But how can we measure the API space as a whole?  I get asked a lot about, what are the top APIs out there.<p>
<a title="ProgrammableWeb Measures Popularity" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?sort=mashups">ProgrammableWeb measures popularity</a> by the number of mashups that are built on an API.  Using this metric, Google Maps, Twitter, Flickr and Youtube rise to the top.<p>
Not all APIs are suited for mashups, and we definitely need more ideas of how to measure popularity and usage of Open APIs.<p>
I would start by using <a title="Alexa" href="https://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a>, <a title="Compete" href="http://www.compete.com/">Compete</a>, and <a title="Quantcast" href="https://www.quantcast.com/">Quantcast</a> who provide SEO related analytics and ranking for web sites.<p>
Next I would look at the number of partners an API has showcased in their developers area or web site.<p>
After partners I would look for the number of developers showcased as part of an API ecosystem.  Not all APIs provide tools for developers to have a public profile, but if they do, this can be an important measurement.<p>
After the number of partner and public users, I would take a close look at how many applications are developed on a platform.  Both internally and community developed applications.  These represent completed projects where developers have successfully integrated with an API.<p>
Then I think overall API community activity and resources would be a good thing to measure.  How many code samples, language kits, FAQ, forum posts, and other resources are provided. This reflects the amount of resources a company and community has put into an API.<p>
There is no perfect way to measure the success and popularity of an API on the open Internet, but these are a few ideas for variables the industry might consider when developing an algorithm for tracking the popularity of APIs in this fast growing space.
