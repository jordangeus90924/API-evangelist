{% include JB/setup %}<p>I get a lot of inquiries from API owners about how they should price their API access in a way that will make sense to developers, but also help them generate revenue from their valuable API resources.As most of us are still trying to figure out sensible pricing for our new APIs, or better understand how to adjust and evolve pricing to better suit existing developers--Amazon is busy reducing their cloud API pricing.  I got a simple email from Amazon today: Dear Amazon S3 Customer, We are excited to announce that we are reducing Amazon S3 request prices in all nine of our regions.We are lowering the prices for GET requests by 60% and the prices for PUT, LIST, COPY, and POST requests by 50%.For example, in the US Standard Region, we are reducing the price of every 1,000 PUT requests from $0.</p>
