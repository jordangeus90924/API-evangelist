{% include JB/setup %}<p>The team over at Chartboost have a pretty forward thinking blog post about what they see as the next generation of web application development.They feel that the future is about creating web applications, not sites.The server side should be an API and the client should be a self-contained app which uses the API as its back-end.With mobile applications following the same pattern.To practice what they preach, Charboost is overhauling their help site to be an API driven web app using the following approach: Push State - Provide site navigation without page refreshes by faking navigation and inserting JavaScript callbacks JSON-API - A REST API providing JSON to drive the site Responsive Design - Providing an application design that responds to mobile as well as it does laptops or desktop computers Vector (Icon Fonts &amp; CSS) - Using a combination of icon fonts and CSS3 to deliver the UI.</p>
