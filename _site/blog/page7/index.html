<p><em>This is one of my talks from <a href="http://www.apidays.io/events/paris-2017">APIDays Paris 2018</a>. Here is the abstract: The modern API toolbox includes a variety of standards and methodologies, which centers around REST,  but also includes Hypermedia, GraphQL, real time streaming, event-driven architecture , and gRPC. API design has pushed beyond just basic access to data, and also can be about querying complex data structures, providing experience rich APIs, real-time data streams with Kafka and other standards, as well as also leveraging the latest algorithms and providing access to machine learning models. The biggest mistake any company, organization, or government agency can do is limit their API toolbox to be just about REST. Learn about a robust and modern API toolbox from the API Evangelist, Kin Lane.</em></p>

<p><strong>Diverse Toolbox</strong><br />
After eight years of evangelizing APIs, when I participate in many API conversations, some people still assume I’m exclusively talking about REST as the API Evangelist–when in reality I am simply talking about APIs that leverage the web. Sure, REST is a dominant design pattern I shine a light on, and has enjoyed a significant amount of the spotlight over the last decade, but in reality on the ground at companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies of all shapes and sizes, I find a much more robust API toolbox is required to get the job done. REST is just one tool in my robust and diverse toolbox, and I wanted to share with you what I am using in 2018.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-1.png" /></p>

<p>The toolbox I’m referring tool isn’t just about what is needed to equip an API architect to build out the perfect vision of the future. This is a toolbox that is equipped to get us from present day into the future, acknowledging all of the technical debt that exists within most organizations which many are looking to evolve as part of their larger digital transformation. My toolbox is increasingly pushing the boundaries of what I’ve historically defined as an API, and I’m hoping that my experiences will also push the boundaries of what you define as an API, making you ready for what you will encounter on the ground within organizations you are delivering APis within.</p>

<p><strong>Application Programming Interface</strong><br />
API is an acronym standing for application programming interface. I do not limit the scope of application in the context to just be about web or mobile application. I don’t even limit it to the growing number of device-based applications I’m seeing emerge. For me, application is about applying the digital resources made available via an programmatic interface. I’m looking to take the data, content, media, and algorithms being made available via APIs and apply them anywhere they are needed on the web, within mobile and device applications, or on the desktop, via spreadsheets, digital signage, or anywhere else that is relevant, and sensible in 2018.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-2.png" /></p>

<p>API does not mean REST. I’m really unsure how it got this dogmatic association, nor do I care. It is an unproductive legacy of the API sector, and one I’m looking to move beyond. Application programming interfaces aren’t the solution to every digital problem we face. They are about understanding a variety of protocols, messaging formats, and trying to understand the best path forward depending on your application of the digital resources you are making accessible. My API toolbox reflects this view of the API landscape, and is something that has significantly evolved over the last decade of my career, and is something that will continue to evolve, and be defined by what I am seeing on the ground within the companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies I am working with.</p>

<p><strong>SOAP</strong><br />
I have been working with databases since 1987, so I fully experienced the web services evolution of our industry. During the early years of the web, there was a significant amount of investment  into thinking about how we exchanged data across many industries, as well as within individual companies when it came to building out the infrastructure to deliver upon this vision. The web was new, but we did the hard work to understand how we could make data interoperability in a machine readable way, with an emphasis on the messages we were exchanging. Looking back I wish we had spent more time thinking about how we were using the web as a transport, as well as the influence of industry and investment interests, but maybe it wasn’t possible as the web was still so new.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-3.png" /></p>

<p>While web services provided a good foundation for delivering application programming interfaces, it may have underinvested in its usage of the web as a transport, and became a victim of the commercial success of the web. The need to deliver web applications more efficiently, and a desire to hastily use the low cost web as a transport quickly bastardized and cannibalized web services, into a variety of experiments and approaches that would get the job done with a lot less overhead and friction. Introducing efficiencies along the way, but also fragmenting our enterprise toolbox in a way which we are still putting back together.</p>

<p><strong>XML &amp; JSON RPC</strong><br />
One of the more fractious aspects of the web API evolution has been the pushback when API providers call their XML or JSON remote procedure call (RPC) APIs, RESTful, RESTish, or other mixing of philosophy and ideology, which has proven to be a dogma stimulating event. RESTafarians prefer that API providers properly define their approach, while many RPC providers could care less about labels, and are looking to just get the job done. Making XML and JSON RPC a very viable approach to doing APIs, something that still persists almost 20 years later.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-4.png" /></p>

<p>Amazon Web Services, Flickr, Slack, and other RPC APIs are doing just fine when it comes to getting the job done, despite the frustration, ranting, and shaming by the RESTafarians. It isn’t an ideal approach to delivering programmatic interfaces using the web, but it reflects its web roots, and gets the job done with low cost web infrastructure. RPC leaves a lot of room for improvement, but is a tool that has to remain in the toolbox. Not because I am designing new RPC APIs, but there is no doubt that at some point I will have to be integrating with an RPC API to do what you need to get done in my regular work.</p>

<p><strong>REST at Center</strong><br />
Roy Fielding’s dissertation on representational state transfer, often referred to as simple REST, is an amazing piece of work. It makes a lot of sense, and I feel is one of the most thorough looks at how to use the web for making data, content, media, and algorithms accessible in a machine readable way. I get why so many folks feel it is the RIGHT WAY to do things, and one of the reasons it is the default approach for many API designers and architects–myself included. However, REST is a philosophy, and much like microservices, provides us with a framework to think about how we put our API toolbox to work, but isn’t something that should blind us from the other tools we have within our reach.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-5.png" /></p>

<p>REST is where I begin most conversations about APIs, but it doesn’t entirely encompass what I mean when every time I use the phrase API. I feel REST has given me an excellent base for thinking about how I deliver APIs, but will slow my effectiveness if I leave my REST blinders on, and let dogma control the scope of my toolbox. REST has shown me the importance of the web when talking about APIs, and will continue to drive how I deliver APIs for many years. It has shown me how to structure, standardize, and simplify how I do APIs, and help my applications reach as wide as possible audience, using commonly understood infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Negotiating CSV</strong><br />
As the API Evangelist, I work with a lot of government, and business users. One thing I’ve learned working with this group is the power of using comma separated values (CSV) as a media type. I know that us developers and database folks enjoy a lot more structure in our lives, but I have found that allowing for the negotiation of CSV responses from APIs, can move mountains when it comes to helping onboard business users, and decision makers to the potential of APIs–even if the data format doesn’t represent the full potential of an API. CSV responses is the low bar I set for my APIs, making them accessible to a very wide business audience.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-6.png" /></p>

<p>CSV as a data format represents an anchor for the lowest common denominator for API access. As a developer, it won’t be the data format I personally will negotiate, but as a business user, it very well could mean the difference between using an API or not. Allowing me to take API responses and work with them in my native environment, the Excel spreadsheet, or Google Sheets environment. As I am designing my APIs, I’m always thinking about how I can make my resources available to the masses, and enabling the negotiation of CSV responses whenever possible, helps me achieve my wier objectives.</p>

<p><strong>Negotiating XML</strong><br />
I remember making the transition from XML to JSON in 2009. At first I was uncomfortable with the data format, and resisted using it over my more proven XML. However, I quickly saw the potential for the scrappy format while developing JavaScript applications, and when developing mobile applications. While JSON is my preferred, and default format for API design, I am still using XML on a regular basis while working with legacy APIs, as well as allowing for XML to be negotiated by the APIs I’m developing for wider consumption beyond the startup community. Some developers are just more comfortable using XML over JSON, and who knows, maybe by extending an XML olive branch, I might help developers begin to evolve in how they consume APIs.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-7.png" /></p>

<p>Similar to CSV, XML represents support for a wider audience. JSON has definitely shifted the landscape, but there are still many developers out there who haven’t made the shift. Whether we are consumers of their APIs, or providing APIs that target these developers, XML needs to be on the radar. Our toolbox needs to still allow for us to provide, consume, validate, and transform XML. If you aren’t working with XML at all in your job, consider yourself privileged, but also know that you exist within a siloed world of development, and you don’t receive much exposure to many systems that are the backbone of government and business.</p>

<p><strong>Negotiating JSON</strong><br />
I think about my career evolution, and the different data formats I’ve used in 30 years. It helps me see JSON as the default reality, not the default solution. It is what is working now, and reflects not just the technology, but also the business and politics of doing APIs in a mobile era, where JavaScript is widely used for delivering responsive solutions via multiple digital channels. JSON speaks to a wide number of developers, but we can’t forget that it is mostly comprised of developers who have entered the sector in the last decade.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-8.png" /></p>

<p>JSON is the default media type I use for any API I’m developing today. No matter what my backend data source is. However, it is just one of several data formats I will potentially open up for negotiation. I feel like plain JSON is lazy, and whenever possible I should be thinking about a wider audience by providing CSV and XML representations, but I should also be getting more structured and standardized in how I handle the requests and responses for my API. While I want my APIs to reach as wide as possible audience, I also want them to deliver rich results that best represents the data, content, media, algorithms, and other digital resources I’m serving up.</p>

<p><strong>Hypermedia Media Types</strong><br />
Taking the affordances present when humans engage with the web via browsers for granted is one of the most common mistakes I make as an API design, developer, and architect. This is a shortcoming I am regularly trying to make up for by getting more sophisticated in my usage of existing media types, and allowing for consumers to negotiate exactly the content they are looking for, and achieve a heightened experience consuming any API that I deliver. Hypermedia media types provide a wealth of ways to deliver consistent experiences, that help be deliver many of the affordances we expect as we make use of data, content, media, and algorithms via the web.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-9.png" /></p>

<p>Using media types like Hal, Siren, JSON API, Collection+JSON, and JSON-LD are allowing me to deliver a much more robust API experience, to a variety of API clients. Hypermedia reflects where I want to be when it comes to API design and architecture that leverages the web, but it is a reflection I have to often think deeply about as I still work to reach out to a wide audience, forcing me to make it one of several types of experience my consumers can negotiate. While I wish everyone saw the benefits, sometimes I need to make sure CSV, XML, and simpler JSON are also on the menu, ensuring I don’t leave anyone behind as I work to bridge where we are with where I’d like to go.</p>

<p><strong>API Query Layers</strong><br />
Knowing my API consumers is an important aspect of how I use my API toolbox. Depending on who I’m targeting with my APIs, I will make different decisions regarding the design pattern(s) I put to work. While I prefer investing resources into the design of my APIs, and crafting the URLs, requests, and responses my consumers will receive, in some situations my consumers might also need much more control over crafting the responses they are getting back. This is when I look to existing API query languages like Falcor or GraphQL to give my API consumers more of a voice in what their API responses will look like.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-10.png" /></p>

<p>API query layers are never a replacement for a more RESTful, or hypermedia approaches to delivering web APIs, but they can provide a very robust way to hand over control to consumers. API design is important for providers to understand, and define the resources they are making available, but a query language can be very powerful when it comes to making very complex data and content resources available via a single API URL. Of course, as with each tool present in this API toolbox, there are trade offs with deciding to use an API query language, but in some situations it can make the development of clients much more efficient and agile, depending on who your audience is, and the resources you are looking to make available.</p>

<p><strong>Webhooks</strong><br />
In my world APIs are rarely a one way street. My APIs don’t just allow API consumers to poll for data, content, and updates. I’m looking to define and respond to events, allowing data, and content to be pushed to consumers. I’m increasingly using Webhooks as a way to help my clients make their APIs a two-way street, and limit the amount of resources it takes to make digital assets available via APIs. Working with them to define the meaningful events that occur across the platform, and allow API consumers to subscribe to these events via Webhooks. Opening the door for API providers to deliver a more event-driven approach to doing APIs.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-11.png" /></p>

<p>Webhooks are the 101 level of event-driven API architecture for API providers. It is where you get started trying to understand the meaningful events that are occurring via any platform. Webhooks are how I am helping API providers understand what is possible, but also how I’m training API consumers in a variety of API communities about how they can deliver better experiences with their applications. I see webhooks alongside API design and management, as a way to help API providers and consumers better understand how API resources are being used, developing a wider awareness around which resources actually matter, and which ones do not.</p>

<p><strong>Websub</strong><br />
In 2018, I am investing more time in putting Websub, formerly known as the word which none of us could actually pronounce, PubSubHubbub. This approach to making content available by subscription as things change has finally matured into a standard, and reflects the evolution of how we deliver APIs in my opinion. I am using Websub to help me understand not just the event-driven nature of the APIs I’m delivering, but also that intersection of how we make API infrastructure more efficient and precise in doing what it does. Helping us develop meaningful subscriptions to data and content, that adds another dimension to the API design and even query conversation.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-12.png" /></p>

<p>Websub represents the many ways we can orchestrate our API implementations using a variety of content types, push and pull mechanisms, all leveraging web as the transport. I’m intrigued by the distributed aspect of API implementations using Websub, and the discovery that is built into the approach. The remaining pieces are pretty standard API stuff using GETs, POSTs, and content negotiation to get the job done. While not an approach I will be using by default, for specific use cases, delivering data and content to known consumers, I am beginning to put Websub to work alongside API query languages, and other event-driven architectural approaches. Now that Websub has matured as a standard, I’m even more interested in leveraging it as part of my diverse API toolbox.th</p>

<p><strong>Server Sent Events (SSE)</strong><br />
I consider webhooks to be the gateway drug for API event-driven architecture. Making API integrations a two street, while also making them more efficient, and potentially real time. After webhooks, the next tool in my toolbox for making API consumption more efficient and real time are server-sent events (SSE). Server-sent events (SSE) is a technology where a browser receives automatic updates from a server via a sustained HTTP connection, which has been standardized as part of HTML5 by the W3C. The approach is primarily used to established a sustained connection between a server, and the browser, but can just as easily be used server to server.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-13.png" /></p>

<p>Server-sent events (SSE) delivers one-way streaming APIs which can be used to send regular, and sustained updates, which can be more efficient than regular polling of an API. SSE is an efficient way to begin going beyond the basics of client-server request and response model and pushing the boundaries of what APIs can do. I am using SSE to make APIs much more real time, while also getting more precise with the delivery of data and content, leverage other standards like JSON Patch to only provide what has changed, rather than sending the same data out over the pipes again, making API communication much more efficient.</p>

<p><strong>Websockets</strong><br />
Shifting things further into real time, websockets is what I’m using to deliver two-way API streams that require data be both sent and received, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. WebSocket is a different TCP protocol from HTTP, but is designed to work over HTTP ports 80 and 443 as well as to support HTTP proxies and intermediaries, making it compatible with the HTTP protocol. To further achieve compatibility, the WebSocket handshake uses the HTTP Upgrade header to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol, pushing the boundaries of APIs beyond HTTP in a very seamless way.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-14.png" /></p>

<p>SSE is all about the one-way efficiency, and websockets is about two-way efficiency. I prefer keeping things within the realm of HTTP with SSE, unless I absolutely need the two-way, full-duplex communication channel. As you’ll see, I’m fine with pushing the definition of API out of the HTTP realm, but I’d prefer to keep things within bounds, as I feel it is best to embrace HTTP when doing business on the web. I can accomplish a number of objectives for data, content, media, and algorithmic access using the HTTP tools in my toolbox, leaving me to be pretty selective when I push things out of this context.</p>

<p><strong>gRPC Using HTTP/2</strong><br />
While I am forced to use Websockets for some existing integrations such as with Twitter, and other legacy implementations, it isn’t my choice for next generation projects. I’m opting to keep things within the HTTP realm, and embracing the next evolution of the protocol, and follow Google’s lead with gRPC. As with other RPC approaches, gRPC is based around the idea of defining a service, specifying the methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types. gRPC embraces HTTP/2 as its next generation transport protocol, and while also employing Protocol Buffers, Google’s open source mechanism for the serialization of structured data.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-15.png" /></p>

<p>At Google, I am seeing Protocol Buffers used in parallel with OpenAPI for defining JSON APIs, providing two speed APIs using HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. I am also seeing Protocol Buffers used with HTTP/1.1 as a transport, making it something I have had to integrated with alongside SOAP, and other web APIs. While I am integrating with APIs that use Protocol Buffers, I am most interested in the usage of HTTP/2 as a transport for APIs, and I am investing more time learning about the next generation headers in use, and the variety of approaches in which HTTP/2 is used as a transport for traditional APIs, as well as multi-directional, streaming APIs.</p>

<p><strong>Apache Kafka</strong><br />
Another shift I could not ignore across the API landscape in 2017 was the growth in adoption of Kafka as a distributed streaming API platform. Kafka focuses on enabling providers to read and write streams of data like a messaging system, and develop applications that react to events in real-time, and store data safely in a distributed, replicated, fault-tolerant cluster. Kafka was originally developed at LinkedIn, but is now an Apache open source product that is in use across a number of very interesting companies, many of which have been sharing their stories of how efficient it is for developing internal data pipelines. I’ve been studying Kafka throughout 2017, and I have added it to my toolbox, despite it pushing the boundaries of my definition of what is an API beyond the HTTP realm.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-16.png" /></p>

<p>Kafka has moved out of the realm of HTTP, using a binary protocol over TCP, defining all APIs as request response message pairs, using its own messaging format. Each client initiates a socket connection and then writes a sequence of request messages and reads back the corresponding response message–no handshake is required on connection or disconnection. TCP is much more efficient over HTTP because it allows you to maintain persistent connections used for many requests. Taking streaming APIs to new levels, providing a super fast set of open source tools you can use internally to deliver the big data pipeline you need to get the job done. My mission is to understand how these pipelines are changing the landscape and which tools in my toolbox can help augment Kafka and deliver the last mile of connectivity to partners, and public applications.</p>

<p><strong>Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)</strong><br />
Continuing to round off my API toolbox in a way that pushes the definition of APIs beyond HTTP, and helping me understand how APIs are being used to drive Internet-connected devices, I’ve added Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), an ISO standard for implementing publish-subscribe-based messaging protocol to my toolbox. The protocol works on top of the TCP/IP protocol, and is designed for connections with remote locations where a light footprint” is required because compute, storage, or network capacity is limited. Making MQTT optimal for considering when you are connecting devices to the Internet, and unsure of the reliability of your connection.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-17.png" /></p>

<p>Both Kafka, and MQTT have shown me in the last couple of years, the limitations of HTTP when it comes to the high and low volume aspects of moving data around using networks. I don’t see this as a threat to APIs that leverage HTTP as a transport, I just see them as additional tools in my toolbox, for projects that meet these requirements. This isn’t a failure of HTTP, this is simply a limitation, and when I’m working on API projects involving internet connected devices I’m going to weight the pros and cons of using simple HTTP APIs, alongside using MQTT, and being a little more considerate about the messages I’m sending back and forth between devices and the cloud over the network I have in place. MQTT reflects my robust and diverse API toolbox, as one that gives me a wide variety of tools I’m familiar with and can use in different environments.</p>

<p><strong>Mastering My Usage Of Headers</strong><br />
One thing I’ve learned over the years while building my API toolbox is the importance of headers, and they are something that have regularly been not just about HTTP headers, but the more general usage of network networks. I have to admit that I understood the role of headers in the API conversation, but had not fully understood the scope of their importance when it comes to taking control over how your APIs operate within a distributed environment. Knowing which headers are required to consume APIs is essential to delivering stable integrations, and providing clear guidance on headers from a provider standpoint is essential to APIs operating as expected on the open web.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-18.png" /></p>

<p>Content negotiation was the header doorway I walked through that demonstrated the importance of HTTP headers when it comes to deliver the meaningful API experiences. Being able to negotiate CSV, XML, and JSON message formats, as well as being able to engage with my digital resources in a deeper way using hypermedia media types. My headers mastery is allowing me to better orchestrate an event-driven experience via webhooks, and long running HTTP connections via Server-Sent Events. They are also taking me into the next generation of connectivity using HTTP/2, making them a critical aspect of my API toolbox. Historically, headers have often been hidden in the background of my API work, but increasingly they are front and center, and essential to me getting the results I’m looking for.</p>

<p><strong>Standardizing My Messaging</strong><br />
I have to admit I had taken the strength of message formats present in my web service days for granted. While I still think they are bloated and too complex, I feel like we threw out a lot of benefits when we made the switch to more RESTful APIs. Overall I think the benefits of the evolution were positive, and media types provide us with some strong ways to standardize the messages we pass back and forth. I’m fine operating in a chaotic world of message formats and schema that are developed in the moment, but I’m a big fan of all roads leading to standardization and reuse of meaningful formats, so that we can try to speak with each other via APIs in more common formats.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-19.png" /></p>

<p>I do not feel that there is one message format to rule them all, or that even one for each industry. I think innovation at the message layer is important, but I also feel like we should be leveraging JSON Schema to help tame things whenever possible, and standardize as media types. Whenever possible, reuse existing standards from day one is preferred, but I get that this isn’t always the reality, and in many cases we are handed the equivalent of a filing cabinet filled with handwritten notes. In my world, there will always be a mixed of known and unknown message formats, something that I will always work to tame, as well as be increasingly apply machine learning models to help me identify, evolve, and make sense of–standardizing things in any way I possibly can.</p>

<p><strong>Knowing (Potential) Clients</strong><br />
I am developing APIs for a wide variety of clients. Some are designed for web applications, others are mobile applications, and some are devices. They could be spreadsheets, widgets, documents, and machine learning models. The tables could be flipped, and the APIs exist on device, and the cloud becomes the client. Sometimes the clients are known, other times they are unknown, and I am looking to attract new types of clients I never envisioned. I am always working to understand what types of clients I am looking to serve with my APIs, but the most important aspect of this process is understanding when there will be unknown clients.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-20.png" /></p>

<p>When I have a tightly controlled group of target clients, my world is much easier. When I do not know who will be developing against an API, and I am looking to encourage wider participation, this is when my toolbox comes into action. This is when I keep the bar as low as possible regarding the design of my APIs, the protocols I use, and the types of data formats and messages I use. When I do not know my API consumers and the clients they will developing, I invest more in API design, and keep my default requests and responses as simple as possible. Then I also allow for the negotiation of more complex, higher speed, more control aspects of my APIs by consumers who are in the know, targeting more specific client scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Using The Right Tools For The Job</strong><br />
API is not REST. It is one tool in my toolbox. API deployment and integration is about having the right tool for the job. It is a waste of my time to demand that everyone understand one way of doing APIs, or my way of doing APIs. Sure, I wish people would study and learn about common API patterns, but in reality, on the ground in companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies, this is not the state of things. Of course, I’ll spend time educating and training folks wherever I can, but my role is always more about delivering APIs, and integrating with existing APIs, and my API toolbox reflects this reality. I do not shame API providers for their lack of knowledge and available resources, I roll up my sleeves, put my API toolbox on the table, and get to work improving any situation that I can.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/api-days-paris-2018/api-not-rest-21.png" /></p>

<p>My API toolbox is crafted for the world we have, as well as the world I’d like to see. I rarely get what I want on the ground deploying and integrating with APIs. I don’t let this stop me. I just keep refining my awareness and knowledge by watching, studying, and learning from what others are doing. I often find that when someone is in the business of shutting down a particular approach, or being dogmatic about a single approach, it is usually because they aren’t on the ground working with average businesses, organizations, and government agencies–they enjoy a pretty isolated, privileged existence. My toolbox is almost always open, constantly evolving, and perpetually being refined based upon the reality I experience on the ground, learning from people doing the hard work to keep critical services up and running, not simply dreaming about what should be.</p>

<p><em>This is one of my talks from <a href="http://www.apidays.io/events/paris-2017">APIDays Paris 2018</a>. Here is the abstract: Understanding the PSD2 regulations unfolding for the banking industry is a daunting challenge for banks, aggregators, and regulators, let alone when you are an average user, journalist, or analyst trying to make sense of things. As the API Evangelist I have used a common approach to mapping out transit systems using the universally recognized subway map introduced by Harry Beck in London in the early 20th century. I’m taking this mapping technique and applying it to the PSD2 specification, helping provide a visual, and interactive way to navigating this new regulatory world unfolding in Europe. Join me for an exploration of API regulations in the banking industry, and how we can use a subway and transit map to help us quickly understand the complexities of PSD2, and learn what takes to get up and running with this new definition for the API economy.</em></p>

<p><strong>Using Transit As API Analogy</strong><br />
I’ve been fascinated with transit systems and subway maps for most of my adult life. Recently I’ve begin thinking about the parallels between complex municipal transit systems, and complex API infrastructure. Beginning in 2015, I started working to see if I could apply the concept of a subway map to the world of APIs, not just as a visualization of complex API systems, but as a working interface to discover, learn about, and even govern hundreds, or even thousands of APIs working in concert. While very much a physical world thing, transit systems still share many common elements with API infrastructure, spanning multiple disparate systems, operated by disparate authorities, possessing legacy as well as modern infrastructure, and are used by many people for work and in their personal lives.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/transit/paris-metro.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>While the transit system isn’t a perfect analogy for modern API infrastructure, there is enough there to keep me working to find a way to apply the concept, and specifically the transit map to helping us make sense of our API-driven systems. I’ve called my work API Transit, leaning on both the noun definition of transit, “the carrying of people, goods, or materials from one place to another”, as well as the verb, “pass across or through (an area)”. The noun portion reflects the moving of our digital bits around the web using APIs, while the verb dimension helps us understand what is often called the API lifecycle, but more importantly the governance that each API should pass through as it matures, and continues to move our important digital bits around.</p>

<p><strong>The History of Subway Maps</strong><br />
The modern approach to mapping transit systems can be traced back to Henry Beck who created the now iconic map of the London Underground in 1933. The methodology was decoupled from earlier ways of mapping and communicating around transit resources, in a way that was focused on how the resources would be experienced by end-users, evolving beyond a focus on the transit resources themselves, and their location in our physical world. At the beginning of the 20th century, subway maps were still being plotted along roads and rivers, leaving them coupled to legacy elements, and ways of thought. By 1915, public transit engineers like Henry Beck were beginning to rethink how they mapped the transit infrastructure, in a way that helped them better communicate their increasingly complex infrastructure internally, but most importantly, in a way that helped them communicate externally to the public.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/november-2015/Beck_Map_1933.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<p>This is what I’m looking to do with applying 20th century transit infrastructure mapping while applying it to 21st century digital API transit infrastructure. We are needing to get people(s) bits, and digital goods and materials around the web, while also understanding how to develop, discover, operate and manage this infrastructure in a consistent, and intuitive way. However, API infrastructure is rapidly growing, and with the introduction of microservices becoming increasingly complex, and difficult to logically map out the increasingly evolving, shifting, and moving API landscape. I’m hoping to suspend reality a little bit as Henry Beck did, and take utilize the same visual cues to begin to visualize API infrastructure in a way that is familiar to not just developers, but hopefully regulators, and average consumers. Much like the transit system of any major city, initially an API transit system will seem overwhelming, and confusing, but with time and experience it will come into focus, and become a natural part of our daily lives.</p>

<p><strong>API Transit Applied To Governance</strong><br />
Over the last two years I have been actively working to apply the API transit model to the concept of API governance. Beginning with API design, I have been looking for a way to help us understand how to consistently craft APIs that meet a certain level of quality set by a team, company, or even an entire industry. I’ve pushed this definition to include many of the almost 100 stops along the API lifecycle I track on as part of my work as the API Evangelist. Allowing API governance transit maps to be crafted, which can be used to help understand API governance efforts, but also help be applied to actually executing against this governance framework. Delivering the verb dimension of API transit, to “pass across or through (an area)”, allowing each API or microservice to regularly pass through each area, line, or stop of each API Transit governance map.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/transit/api-governance-subway-map.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>API Transit began as a way to define and visualize the API lifecycle for me, acknowledging that the lifecycle is rarely ever a straight line. Often times it begins as that, but then over time it can become a mashup of different areas, lines, and stops that will need to be realized on a regular basis, on a one time basis, or any other erratic combination our operations can conceive of. With API Transit applied as an API governance model, I wanted to push the analogy even further, and see if I can push it to accommodate an individual API definition, or even a complex set of microservices working in concert. I began playing with a variety of existing API implementations, looking for one that could be used to tell a bigger story of how the transit model could be use beyond mapping how buses, trains, and other transit vehicles operate.</p>

<p><strong>API Transit For PSD2 Landscape</strong><br />
To push the API transit concept further, I took the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) governing banking APIs in Europe, to see what might be possible when it comes to mapping out API infrastructure in a impactful way. I was able to easily map out lines for some of the most common aspects of PSD2, visualizing accounts, transactions, customers, and then eventually every other stop I wanted to include. The trick now, is how to I articulate shared stops, transfer stations, and other common patterns that exist as part of the PSD2 specification. I didn’t want to just visualize the banking regulations, I want to create an interactive visualization that can be experienced by developers, regulators, and even end-users.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/transit/psd2-transit.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>The HTML Canvas transit map solution I’m using allows me to plot each line, and stop, and give each stop a label as well as a link. This allows me to provide much more detail about each stop, allowing someone exploring the specification to obtain much more information about each aspect of how the PSD2 specification is put to use. The resulting API transit map for the PSD2 landscape is pretty crude, and not very attractive. It will take much more work to bring each line in alignment, and allowing for overlap and redundancy to exist across lines. The reasons behind each line and stop will be different than a physical transit map, but there are still existing constraints I need to consider as a craft each transit map. The process is very rewarding, and helps me better understand each intimate detail of the PSD2 specification, something I’m hoping will eventually be passed on visually, and experimentally to each map user.</p>

<p><strong>API Transit Is OpenAPI Defined</strong><br />
As part of my rendering of the API Transit map for the PSD2 landscape, I was able to generate the HTML5 Canvas using the OpenAPI for the PSD2 API. Each line was created by the tags applied across APIs, and each stop was created to reflect each individual API method available. Providing a machine readable set of instructions to quantify what the structure of the landscape should be. I feel that the tagging of each API method can be improved, and used as the key driver of the how each API transit map is rendered. Something that will be used to make sense of complex renderings, as well as deliver on much more simplified, distilled versions to help make the landscape more accessible to non-developers.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/psd2/openapi-psd2.png" width="75%" /></p>

<p>The details present as part of each PSD2 API path, method, parameters, responses, and schema can be rendered as part of the information provided with each stop. Providing a clear, but detailed representation of each stop within the API Transit system, from a machine readable core which will be used to make the API Transit map more interactive, as well as part of a larger continuous deployment and integration experience. While each stop along each PSD2 line will not always be linear in nature, this approach allows for stops to be organized in a meaningful order, driven by a set of common machine readable rules that can be versioned, evolved over time, and used throughout the API Transit system, and tooling that is deployed to keep the API Transit system operational.</p>

<p><strong>API Transit Has Hypermedia Engine</strong><br />
With the ability to map out an overall API governance system, as well as a set of microservices that meet a specific industry objective, I needed a way to put in all into motion, so it could work together as a complete API transit system. I chose hypermedia to be the engine for the interaction layer, and OpenAPI to be the definition for each individual API. Hypermedia is used as a scaffolding for each area, line, and stop along the transit system, allowing each API to be navigated, but in a way that each API could also navigate any overall API governance model. Introducing the concept that an API could be experienced by any human, and any API governance model could be experienced by an API–again, allowing it to “pass across or through (an area)”, thus API Transit.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/psd2/psd2-hypermeida-engine.png" width="75%" /></p>

<p>Each API has a machine readable OpenAPI definition allowing requests and responses to be made against the surface area of the API as it is explored via the API Transit experience, much like interactive documentation provides already. However, the same OpenAPI definition allows the API to also be validated against overall API governance practices, ensuring certain design standards are met. I’m also playing with the use a machine readable APIs.json index for each API, in addition to the OpenAPI definition, allowing governance to be easily expanded to other API governance lines like management, documentation, pricing, support, terms of service, and other aspects of API operations not defined in an OpenAPI, but could be indexed within an APIs.json document.</p>

<p><strong>API Transit Runs As Github Repository</strong><br />
To continue evolving on the API Transit experience, I’ve begun deploying the API Transit map, with OpenAPI core, and hypermedia engine to Github for continuous deployment, and hosting of the API Transit map using Github Pages. Github, combined with Github Pages, and the static CMS solution Jekyll introduces an interesting opportunity for bringing each API Transit map to life. Jekyll transforms the hypermedia engine, and each API definition into a collection of objects which can be referenced with the API Transit map using the Liquid syntax. This allows each area, line, and stop to be easily traveled, moving from stop to stop, transferring between lines, and consuming rich information all along the way.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/apistrat-portland/jekyll-plus-github.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Running each API Transit map makes exploring an interactive experience, but it also makes the experience easily part of any continuous integration or deployment pipeline, using Git or the Github API to engage with, or evolve the API Transit definition. This makes each API definition seamlessly integrated with actual deployment workflows, while also making API governance also part of these workflows, helping realize API testing, monitoring, validation, and other elements of the build process. With seamless integration as part of existing continuous deployment and integration workflows, I can easily envision a future where API Transit maps aren’t just interactive, but they are continually changing, streaming, and visually updated in real time.</p>

<p><strong>Each Stop Filled With Information</strong><br />
Each stop along an API Transit line is defined by its OpenAPI path, and navigated to by the hypermedia engine, but that is just the beginning. The hypermedia object for each stop contains the basics like the name and description of the stop, as well as the reference to the path, method, parameters, responses, and schema in the OpenAPI, but it also can possess other fields, images, video, audio, and links that deliver rich information about each individual stop. The hypermedia engine allows us to define and evolve these over time without breaking the client, which is the API Transit map. Providing an huge opportunity to educate as well as implement governance at each stop along the API Transit line(s).</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/transit/multi-modal-ddot.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Since a stop can be along an API governance line, or along an individual API line, the opportunity for education is enormous. We can educate developers about healthy API design practices, or we can educate a developer about a specific API method, where the healthy API design practices can be fully realized. With this approach to using Github Pages, Jekyll, and a hypermedia engine as an interactive CMS, there is a pretty significant opportunity to make the API Transit experience educational and informative for anyone exploring. Each developer, aggregator, regulator, and even end-users can take control over which aspects of the PSD2 specification they wish to engage with and learn about, allowing for the PSDS API Transit to serve as wide of an audience possible.</p>

<p><strong>Map Progress Of Individual Banks</strong><br />
While there is an OpenAPI, and now API Transit map for the overall PSD2 specification. I will be using the approach to track on the evolution of each individual bank in Europe being impacted by the regulation. Ideally each bank will actively maintain and publish their own OpenAPI definition, something I will be actively advocating for, but ultimately I know the way things end up working in the real world, and I’ll have to maintain an OpenAPI definition for many of the banks, scraping them from the documentation each bank provides, and SDKs available on Github. I will use this as a literal map of the progress for each individual bank, and how compliant they are with EU regulation.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/psd2/bank-single.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Each individual bank PSD2 API Transit map will allow me to navigate the APIs for each bank, including URLs, and other information that is unique to each provider. I will be using APIs.json to track index API operations, which I will work to bring out as visual elements through the API Transit map experience. In theory, each banks APIs will be an exact copy of the master PSD2 specification, but I’m guessing more often than not, when you overlay the master PSD2 API Transit with each individual bank’s API Transit map, you are going to see some differences. Some differences will be positive, but most will demonstrate deficiencies and deviation from the overall guidance provided by EU regulatory agencies.</p>

<p><strong>Compare Over PSD2 To Individual Banks</strong><br />
I am using the hypermedia engine for the API Transit map to crawl each individual banks implementation to deliver the overlap map I discussed. I’m working on a way to show the differences between the master PSD2 specification, and one or many individual PSD2 API implementations. I’m not just looking to create an overlay map for visual reference, I will actually crawl the OpenAPI for each individual bank and output a checklist of which paths, parameters, and schema they do not support, ensuring their definition matches the master PSD2 specification. The first approach to doing this will be about comparing OpenAPI definitions, with a second dimension actually running assertions against the API for those that I have access to.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/psd2/bank-comparison.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>There will be too much information to show on a single API Transit map, especially if we are comparing multiple banks at once. There will need to be a report format, accompanying a PSD2 API Transit map overlay showing the differences at the overall line and stop level. The programmatic comparison between the master PSD2 API and each of the banks will be easy to accomplish using the hypermedia engine, as well as the detailed OpenAPI definition. What will prove to be more challenging, is to create a meaningful representation of that map that allows the differences to be visualized, as well as the detail that is missing or present to be navigated via an aggregate Github repository.</p>

<p><strong>Apply Governance To Individual Banks</strong><br />
In addition to comparing the OpenAPI definitions of individual banks against the master PSD2 OpenAPI definition, I’m using the API Transit hypermedia engine to compare each individual API against the overall API governance. At first the API governance will just be about the API design elements present in the OpenAPI definition for each bank’s API. I will be looking for overall design considerations that may or may not be present in the master PSD2 specification, as well as beginning to add in additional API governance areas like testing, monitoring, performance, documentation, and other areas I mentioned earlier, which will be tracked via an APIs.json index.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/transit/api-governance-subway-map.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>There are a number of details I’d like to see banks provide that isn’t covered as part of the PSD2 guidance. Having an API is only the beginning of usable banking solution for 3rd party applications. There needs to be documentation, support, and other elements present, or a well designed, and PSD2 compliant doesn’t mean much. I’m using API Transit to take the governance of PSD2 implementations beyond what the EU has put into motion. Taking what I know from the wider API sector and getting to work to map out, validate, and rank banking APIs regarding how easy to use, responsive, and usable their PSD2 APIs are. Making sure 3rd party developers, aggregators, and regulators can get at the APIs that are supposed to be defining their compliance.</p>

<p><strong>Use to Map Out Countries &amp; Regions</strong><br />
Using API Transit, I will be aso zooming out and mapping out the PSD2 landscape for individual countries, and regions. Creating separate transit maps that allow each country to be navigated, using the API Transit hypermedia engine to crawl each banks API Transit system map, and eventually provide aggregate comparison tools to see how different banks compare. With a machine readable index of each country, as well as individual indexes of each bank, the entire PSD2 regulatory landscape will become explorable via a series of API transit maps, as well as programmatically using the hypermedia engine present for each individual bank API implementation.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/psd2/coountries.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>API Transit is meant to help map out the complexity of individual API systems, as well as the overall API governance in place. It will also enable the mapping of the complexity of many implementations across cities, regions, and countries. Allowing for regulatory tooling to eventually be developed on top of the thousands of Github repositories that will be created, housing each individual banks API Transit maps. Leveraging the Github API, Git, and the hypermedia and OpenAPI core of each individual API Transit implementation. Allowing for searching, reporting, auditing, and other essential aspects of making sure PSD2 is working.</p>

<p><strong>Making Sense Of Complex API Landscapes</strong><br />
The goal of API Transit is to make sense of complex API landscape. Tracking the details of thousands of API operations across the EU countries who are required to be compliant in 2018. Providing machine readable blueprints of the regulation, as well as each individual bank that is required to be compliant, and each individual detail of what that compliance means.  Then tying it all together with a hypermedia engine that allows it to be explored by any system or tooling, with a familiar transit map on top of it all–providing a way for humans to explore and navigate this very complex banking API landscape.</p>

<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope/losangelescloudy/blue_circuit/file-00_00_35_50.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<p>As I am evolving the process of creating API Transit maps, the API Transit hypermedia engine allows for the development of a gradual awareness of a very complex and technical landscape. It all feels the same as when I land in any new city and begin understand the local transit system. At first, I am overwhelmed, and confused, but the more time I spend exploring the transit maps, riding the subway and buses, developing a familiarity with each system, the easier it all becomes. There is a reason transit maps are used to provide access to complex municipal transit systems, as they help provide a comprehensive view of the landscape, that allows you to find your way around, and use as a reference as you develop an awareness–this is what I’m looking to build with API Transit for the banking sector.</p>

<p><strong>Tours For Individual Roles</strong><br />
One of the benefits of an API Transit map client that is built on a hypermedia engine is that you can take advantage of the ability to change the map, and experience depending on who you are targeting. The concept of the transit maps allows us to suspend realities of the physical world, and the hypermedia client for the API Transit map can suspend realities of the virtual world, allowing for the creation of unique tours and experiences depending on who the end user is. The complete API Transit map for each bank’s implementation will still exist, but the ability to suspend some details to distill down complexity into more simpler experiences will be possible.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-people.JPG" width="75%" /></p>

<p>The objective of individual API Transit tours and experiences will allow for onboarding new developers, business users, or possibly regulator oversight looking at just a specific dimension of the PSD2 guidance. Allowing for the ability to zoom in just at the customer experience layer, or possible just the transactional capabilities across many banking API providers or even a city, region, or country. Think of how a city might have separate transit maps for the subway, buses, and other systems, but still have the overall system map. We can do the same with API Transit, further reducing complexity, and helping users make sense of the complex banking API systems.</p>

<p><strong>Interactive Industry API Governance</strong><br />
For API governance to be effective it needs to be understood by everyone being impacted, and are required to participate. It has to be able to measured, quantified, tested, audited, and visualized in real time, to understand how it is working, and not working. Modern API operations excel at doing this at the company, organization, institutional, and government level, and we should be using API solutions and tooling to help us understand how governance is being applied. There should be machine readable definitions, and common media types, as well as API driven tooling for educating, implementing, and measuring API governance–completing the API loop.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/psd2/psd2-eu.png" width="60%" /></p>

<p>This is another reason why the transit analogy is working so well for me when it comes to making API governance an interactive experience. I’m able to develop not just linear experiences where participants can click next, next, next and walk through everything. They can choose their own paths, experience the lines they feel need attention, while allowing managers, auditors, and regulators to understand how well each implementation is responding, evolving, and interacting with regulations. Making API governance at the industry level interactive not just for the banks and the EU regulatory body, but also for every other participant in between trying to make sense of what is happening with PSD2 in 2018.</p>

<p><strong>Continuously Deployed And Integrated</strong><br />
As I mentioned before, API Transit runs 100% on Github, within a Github repository. The API Transit map client is unaware of each individual banks API implementation. The uniqueness for each implementation resides in a series of Siren hypermedia, OpenAPI, and APIs.json files, that provide a machine readable snapshot of the implementation. The combination of Github, and the machine readable YAML core of each API Transit instance makes it all able to be integrated into continuous integration and deployment pipelines. Evolving each API Transit instance, as each actual banks API implementation is built and released–hopefully ensuring they are kept in sync with the reality on the ground at each bank.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/continuous/continuous-bw.png" width="75%" /></p>

<p>At this point, API Transit has become another application being developed upon the banking APIs that PSD2 are designed to expose. It ultimately will be an aggregated application that uses not just one banking API, but all the banking APIs. The difference from other aggregators is API Transit is not interested in the data each bank possesses. It is interested in continuously understanding how well each banks API is when it comes to complying with PSD2 regulations, while also continuously helping developers, aggregators, regulators, and anyone else make sense of the complexities of banking APIs and the PSD2 regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Mapping Technology, Business, &amp; Politics</strong><br />
While API Transit seems very technical at first look, the solution is meant to help make sense of the business and politics around the PSD2 rollout. The first part of the conversation might seem like it is about ensuring each bank has a compliant API, but it is more about ensuring they have common operational level components of API operations like a developer portal, documentation, support, and other business aspects of doing business with APIs. Next, it will be about ensuring all the technical aspects of PSD2 compliant APIs in place, validating each API path, as well as it’s responses, schema, and other components.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/tech-business-politics-03-2014.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>While we need to make sure 100% of the PSD2 OpenAPI definition is represented with each bank, we also need to make sure that API is accessible, secure, and usable, otherwise none of this matters. If a bank plays politics by making their API unusable to aggregators and 3rd party developers, yet appear on the surface to have a functioning API that is compliant with the PSD2 specification, we need to be able to identify that this is the case, make sure we are testing for these scenarios on a recurring basis, and be able to visualize and report upon it to regulators. Properly addressing the technical, as well as the business, and politics of API operations.</p>

<p><strong>Making API Regulation More Familiar</strong><br />
The main reason I’m using the transit map approach is because it is familiar. Secondarily, because the concept continues to work after two years of pushing forward the concept. Everyone I have shown it to immediately responds with, “well the trick will be to not make things too overwhelming and complicated”. Which I response with, “do you remember the first time you used the transit system in your city? How did you feel?” Overwhelmed, and thinking this was complicated–because it is. However, because there is a familiar, universal map that helps you navigate this complexity, eventually you begin to learn more about the complexity of the city you live in, or are visiting. Helping bridge the complexity, making it all a little more familiar over time.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/transit/paris-metro.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>The transit map concept is universal and familiar. It is in use across hundreds of transit systems around the globe. The transit map is familiar, but it also has the ability to help make a complex system more familiar with a little exploration, and over the course of time. This is why I’m extending the transit approach to the world of APIs, and using it to make complex API systems like the PSD2 banking API regulation more familiar. Banking APIs aren’t easy. Banking regulations aren’t easy. We need a map to help us navigate this world, and be able to make sense of the complexity, even as it continues to evolve over time–API Transit is that.</p>

<p><strong>Helping API Regulation Be More Consistent</strong><br />
API Transit is machine readable, driven by existing specifications, including Siren a hypermedia media type, OpenAPI, and APIs.json. The first machine readable definition I started with was the OpenAPI definition for the PSD2 regulation. This was the seed, then I generated the hypermedia engine from that, and took the API governance engine I had been working on for the last couple of years and built it into the existing API Transit core. The objective of all of this work is to use the framework to introduce more consistency into how I am mapping out the rollout of PSD2 across the European banking landscape. This is something that is too big to do manually, and something that requires a machine readable, API driven approach to get the job done properly.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/transit/map-of-moscow-metro-underground2.gif" width="100%" /></p>

<p>The PSD2 OpenAPI definition provides a way to consistently measure, and report on whether each banks APIs are in compliance with PSD2 regulations. The APIs.json is meant to make sure each bank’s APIs are in compliance with API Evangelists guidelines for API operations. The Siren hypermedia engine is meant to enable the consistent crawling and auditing of everything as it evolves over time by other systems and applications, and when combined with the HTML5 Canvas API Transit map, it allows humans to explore, navigate, and visual banking APIs, and the PSD2 regulations in a more consistent, and organized fashion.</p>

<p><strong>Seeing PSD2 In Motion In A Visual Way</strong><br />
Ultimately, API Transit is about being able to see API operations across an industry in a visual way, where you can see everything in motion. Applying it to the PSD2 landscape is meant to help  visualize and understand everything happening. It has taken me many hours of work to get intimate with the core OpenAPI definition for PSD2. Learning about all the paths and schema that make up the regulation. As I work to evaluate the compliance of hundreds of banks across France and UK, I’m quickly realizing that it will be beyond my capacity to be able to see everything that is going on. API Transit helps me see the PSD2 landscape in a way that I can be regularly updated, revisited, and experienced as the landscape evolves.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/subway/london_underground2.gif" width="100%" /></p>

<p>The PSD2 API Transit application is just getting started. The methodology has been proven, and I’ve begun profiling banks, and collecting OpenAPI definitions for any APIs that I find, and profiling the wider presence of their API operations using APIs.json. Then I will begin improving on the mapping capabilities of the API Transit map client, making for a more visually pleasing experience. Along the way I am working with partners to better monitor the availability and performance of each banks APIs. Within a couple of months I expect a clearer picture to begin to come into focus regarding how the PSD2 landscape is unfolding in 2018, and by the end of the year, it will become clear which banks have emerged as competitive leaders within the API economy.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on two talks for <a href="http://www.apidays.io/events/paris-2017">API Days in Paris next week</a>. These talks are at two opposite ends of the API spectrum for me. The first one, API Is Not Just REST, is rooted in the technology of APIs, but then touches lightly on the business and politics of APIs. The second one, a regulatory subway map for PSD2, is all about the politics of APIs, but then touches lightly on the business and technology of APIs. I have the outlines for both talks done, and I’m working on the narrative and slides for each, along the way I’m really caught by how different each end of the spectrum are, and require me to use a different part of my brain–something I think really defines the yin and yang of APIs.</p>

<p>When I’m down at the protocol level of APIs, thinking about the details of HTTP, TCP, and the nuance of how headers are used, and the messages we pass back and forth, the politics of APIs do not matter to me. My developer and architect brain is absorbed with the technical details, and the human or political consequences of my decisions really do not matter all that much. As long as things are technically correct, and my responses and requests are doing what is expected, I am good. It is easy for me to be railroaded within this technical silo, and I wouldn’t ever need to be concerned for the business and politics of it all, if my work as API Evangelist didn’t force me out of my comfort zone.</p>

<p>Inversely, when I’m thinking about the politics of how this all works, and the intention and impact of regulatory guidance like PSD2 in Europe, the technical details of HTTP, headers, and what messages I’m using feel less important. Sure, they still matter to what I’m trying to do, but the strictness in which I define my protocols, headers, data formats, schema, and other gears of API operations takes a looser form. When you look at banks who have NO PUBLIC API, just getting them up an running seems much more important than ensuring each HTTP response status code is present, and each schema is perfectly represented. Eventually, I will need to make sure all my technical i’s are dotted, and t’s are crossed, but I have bigger battles to wage at the moment.</p>

<p>As I’m pulled back and forth between the technical and the politics of APIs, I find myself becoming very, very aware of the business of APIs, and how the complexity of both technology and the politics are wielded for business gain. Seeing how technology is used as a competitive advantage, as well as leveraging politics to get ahead in the game. You see this in the rhetoric around PSD2, where invoking the bogey man can be very telling of a company’s position, just as much as the company’s who are proactively jumping on the PSD2 bandwagon, and getting ahead of the game, or even being a leader when it comes to defining implementations. Competitive edges can be sharpened by embracing political shifts, as well as through the adoption of leading edge technologies present across the API space (Kafka, OpenAPI, etc.)–it really depends on your organizations approach to the API game, and how up to speed you are on how it is played.</p>

<p>While I don’t feel it should be everyone’s role to be exposed to the all the extremes of the API sector, I do feel like we do a poor job of exposing developers and architects to the business and politics of it all in a meaningful way. I also feel like we spend too much time either hiding from or protecting business users from the technical details. I find that I learn a lot being pulled back and forth to either end of the spectrum, something I’m hoping to share as part of my talks next week in France, as well as the conversations I have in the hallways at the conference, and meeting rooms before and after the event. I look forward to seeing you all in Paris, and Grenoble next week.</p>

<p>I’m signing up for a large number of new APIs lately as part of a project I am working on. It is pretty normal for me to sign up for a couple new APIs a week, or 10-20 within a month, but right now I’m signing up for hundreds, setting up an application and getting keys for each service. I’ll share more about what I’m working on in future stories, but I wanted to talk more about the on-boarding practices of some of these APIs. It is pretty clear from the on-boarding processes that I don’t rank very high in some of these API provider’s sales funnels, making me not deserving of self-service access, or even a sales call–which is a separate topic I will talk about in a future post.</p>

<p>I’ve registered with a number of high value API providers who have more of an enterprise focus, but also have a seemingly self-service, public API available. After signing up for access, it becomes very clear that APIs are anything but self-service, and there is a sales funnel in play, and I’ve been ranked, tagged, and identified where I am in this sales funnel, and what value I bring as a potential small business–which is not much by usual measurements. I’m pretty well versed in how company’s set up their sales strategy, and have seen many companies think it is a good idea to translate these practies to their API operations. Only targeting the high value customers, and not really giving a shit about the rest of them. It just isn’t worth the resources to go after them, they don’t have the spending capacity of customers you want in your funnel.</p>

<p>I get it. You are right. I don’t have a lot of money to buy your services, and will not become a high value customers. However, I have many readers who are high value customers, and trust my opinion about which services are worthy paying attention to. And guess what? I’m not going to write about your service. I’m not going to include you in my prime time storytelling, and when I do reference your API as part of my research, it will be in the club of shame, and APIs that really aren’t worth your time playing with. My enterprise readers, growing startups, university IT leadership, and government project owners with big budgets won’t ever know about your API, all because you didn’t see me as being worth your time, and your API on-boarding practices are out dated.</p>

<p>In a self-service API world you don’t need to be high touch with the long tail of your API consumers. This is why we have API management in place, with sensibly priced access tiers, requiring monthly levels of access, all requiring credit cards on file. While it frustrates me when companies don’t have a free tier of access for me to kick the tires, I get it. What makes a situation untenable is when I put in a credit card, and I am willing to spend a couple hundred bucks to write a story, build a prototype, or publish a landscape guide or white paper, and I still can’t get access to your resources and understand what is going on. It’s ok. I’m guessing they probably weren’t worth sharing with my readers anyways, and you belong right where you should belong in my API research that gets read by business and IT leadership around the globe.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Jan 2018</span>
        <p><a href="http://apis.how/streamdata"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/containership_dali_three.jpg" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>One aspect of my partnership with <a href="http://apis.how/streamdata">Streamdata.io</a> is about helping define what it is that Streamdata.io does–internally, and externally. When I use any API technology I always immerse myself in what it does, and understand every detail regarding the value it delivers, and I work to tell stories about this. This process helps me refine not just how I talk about the products and services, but also helps influence the road map for what the products and services deliver. As I get intimate with what Streamdata.io delivers, I’m beginning to push forward how I talk about the company.</p>

<p>The first thoughts you have when you hear the name Streamdata.io, and learn about how you can proxy any existing JSON API, and begin delivering responses via Server-Sent Events (SSE) and JSON Patch, are all about streaming and real time. While streaming of data from existing APIs is the dominant feature of the service, I’m increasingly finding that the conversations I’m having with clients, and would be clients are more about efficiencies, caching, and streamlining how companies are delivering data. Many API providers I talk to tell me they don’t need real time streaming, but at the same time they have rate limits in place to keep their consumers from polling their APIs too much, increasing friction in API consumption, and not at all about streamlining it.</p>

<p>These experiences are forcing me to shift how I open up conversations with API providers. Making real time and streaming secondary to streamlining how API providers are delivering data to their consumers. Real time streaming using Server-Sent Events (SSE) isn’t always about delivering financial and other data in real time. It is about delivering data using APIs efficiently, making sure only what what has been updated and needed is delivered when it is needed. The right time. This is why you’ll see me increasingly adding (line) to the Stream(line)data.io name, helping focus on the fact that we are helping streamline how companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are putting data to work–not just streaming data in real time.</p>

<p>I really enjoy this aspect of getting to know what a specific type of API technology delivers, combined with the storytelling that I engage in. I was feeling intimidated about talking about streaming APIs with providers who clearly didn’t need it. I’m not that kind of technologist. I just can’t do that. I have to be genuine in what I do, or I just can’t do it. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that conversations were quickly becoming about making things more efficient, over actually ever getting to the streaming real time portion of things. It makes what I do much easier, and something I can continue on a day to day basis, across many different industries.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/01/17/api-management-and-the-measurement-of-value-exchange/">I’ve been thinking about the potential for measuring value exchange at the API management level a lot more lately</a>, and while I’m working on a project to profile banks that are needing to comply with the PSD2 regulations in Europe, I’m thinking about the missed opportunities for the API providers I’m using to fuel my research to leverage the value I’m generating. I’m using a variety of data enrichment APIs for helping add to the contact data, corporate profiles, images, documents, patents, and other valuable data to what I’m doing as part of my wider research into the API space. While these APIs have valuable services that I am paying for, all of the APIs are just using one HTTP verb–GET.</p>

<p>On a regular basis I come across incorrect, or incomplete data, and as part of my work I dive in and correct the data, and continue to connect the dots. I often find better copies of logos, add in relevant business profile data, and I always provide very detailed information regarding a company’s API–which I find to be some of the most telling aspects of what a company does, or doesn’t do. I’m thankful for the services that the 3rd party APIs I utilize, but I think they are missing out on a pretty big opportunity for trusted partners like me to be able to POST or PUT the data I am gathering back to their systems.</p>

<p>I would love to be able to POST and PUT back information to the APIs I am GETting my data from, and receive credits to my API bill for these contributions. It would benefit API providers by helping ensure the data they are providing is complete and acurate, and it would benefit me by helping me keep my API bills as low as possible. I understand that it would some work on the provider side to ensure I’m a trusted partner, and being able to verify the POST and PUT API calls I am making actually add value, but with a proper queue, and a little bit of human power, it wouldn’t take that much. At first it may seem like the investment would be more than the value, but all you’d have to do is find a handful of partners like me who would significantly contribute to the data you provide via your APIs.</p>

<p>When it comes to the value exchanged via APIs, and it always seems to be the heavily dominated user generated content platforms like Facebook and Twitter, or the GET only data providers, without a lot in between. Most providers I talk with are nervous about the quality of data, and the overhead with managing contributions. Which is definitely true if the flood gates are wide open, but with the proper approach to API management, and sensible access tiers for partners, you could easily identify who the most valuable API consumers were. Do not miss out on the opportunity to allow trusted partners like me to POST and PUT, and receive credits on my bill, making API management, and the value exchange that occurs via your platform a two-way street.</p>

<p>As part of my continued effort to break down <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/payment-services-psd-2-directive-eu-2015-2366_en">the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) in Europe</a>, and develop my awareness of how the regulations are intended, as well as the reality on the ground within the industry, I am working to map out all of the players involved. This post is about understanding the role of the European Banking Authority (EBA), and clearly understanding when and where they come into the conversation.</p>

<p>First, what is the <a href="http://www.eba.europa.eu/">European Banking Authority (EBA)</a>? They are the regulatory agency for the European Union, who is in charge of conducting stress tests on European banks and increasing transparency in the European financial system and identifying weaknesses in banks’ capital structures. When it comes to PSD2, their role is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>develop a publicly accessible central register of authorised payment institutions, which shall be kept up to date by the national authorities</li>
  <li>assist in resolving disputes between national authorities</li>
  <li>develop regulatory technical standards on strong customer authentication and secure communication channels with which all payment service providers must comply</li>
  <li>develop cooperation and information exchange between supervisory authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>The catalyst for this post was because I was looking for the <em>“central register of authorized payment institutions”</em>, and could not find it. Something that will be critical to this effort working, and evolving. I’m also on the hunt for more details regarding how they will be addressing authentication for all 3rd party API access, which will also be something that makes or breaks this effort. And, of course, as the API Evangelist I’m looking to help anyone in the position of helping <em>“develop cooperation and information exchange”</em>–it is what I do.</p>

<p>When it comes to PSD2, I have gotten to know <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/psd2/blob/master/_data/psd2/openapi.yaml">the API definition (OpenAPI)</a>, and I am making my way through the actual set of laws, but I’m still working to understand who all the players are. I’ll keep profiling every type participant in the PSD2 theater that is unfolding across Europe in 2018, until each of the actors makes sense in my head, and I can speak to all of them intelligently. Then I’m hoping to compare notes with my research regarding banking in the United States, and see how it all looks. I’ll be spending next week in France talking with bankers about PSD2, and giving a talk on API governance at this level. So for now, I’m going to be all about EU banking, but I’m engaged in several conversations here in the states with major banks as well, which will all make for some great financial API storytelling over the next couple of months.</p>

<p>I’m immersed in studying <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/payment-services-psd-2-directive-eu-2015-2366_en">the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) in Europe</a>, which includes an API definition to help enable the interoperability they are looking to achieve as part of the regulation. I’m working to break down the directive into bit such chunks to help be digest, and understand exactly what it does. The PSD2 laws seeks to improve the existing EU rules for electronic payments (hence the 2), and takes into account emerging approaches to payment services, such as Internet and mobile payments, with APIs at the hear.</p>

<p>The directive sets out rules concerning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>strict security requirements for electronic payments and the protection of consumers’ financial data, guaranteeing safe authentication and reducing the risk of fraud</li>
  <li>the transparency of conditions and information requirements for payment services</li>
  <li>the rights and obligations of users and providers of payment services</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, “the directive is complemented by <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32015R0751">Regulation (EU) 2015/751</a> which puts a cap on interchange fees charged between banks for card-based transactions. This is expected to drive down the costs for merchants in accepting consumer debit and credit cards.” Which can be one of the most frustrating aspects of banking today, where you have no expectations regarding the fees you can be charged around every turn, as you are just trying to make ends meet.</p>

<p>You will be seeing a lot more posts about PSD2 as I work to absorb the regulations, and the technical guidance set forth regarding banking APIs. I’m playing around with the OpenAPI definition for PSD2, and crafting a version of my API Transit subway map to represent the technical guidance present. I’m also working to understand the business, and political aspects of PSD2, which involves me breaking down the directive into this small, digestible stories, here on API Evangelist.</p>

<p>I was doing some work on the AWS API Gateway, and as I was going through their API documentation I found some of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-swagger-extensions.html">the OpenAPI vendor extensions they use as part of operations</a>. These vendor extensions show up in the OpenAPI you export for any API, and reflect how AWS has extended the OpenAPI specification, making sure it does what they need it to do as part of AWS API Gateway operations.</p>

<p>AWS has 20 separate OpenAPI vendor extensions as part of the OpenAPI specification for any API you manage using their gateway solution:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-swagger-extensions-any-method.html">x-amazon-apigateway-any-method</a> - Specifies the Swagger Operation Object for the API Gateway catch-all ANY method in a Swagger Path Item Object.

</ul>

<p>I keep track of these vendor extensions as part of <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">my OpenAPI toolbox</a>, but I also like to aggregate them, and learn from them. They tell an important story of what AWS is looking to do with the AWS API Gateway. They point to some interesting use cases for the OpenAPI specification including validation, and transforming or mapping API requests and responses, to name a few. There is always a lot to learn from API providers who are extending the OpenAPI specification.</p>

<p>I encounter a number of API designers and architects who don’t know they can extend the specification. It is important that teams realize they can not just extend the specification to fit their needs, but also that they should be learning from how other API proviers are doing this. A few signs of an API provider who is further along in their API journey are 1) actively maintaining and sharing and OpenAPI definition for their APIs, and 2) actively extending and sharing the vendor extensions they use to make OpenAPI do exactly what they need.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/01/19/a-health-check-response-format-for-http-apis/">A Health Check Response Format for HTTP APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">19 Jan 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/irakli/health-check-response-format-for-http-apis.png" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>My friend Irakli Nadareishvili, <a href="https://inadarei.github.io/rfc-healthcheck/">has published a new health check response format for HTTP APIs</a> that I wanted to make sure was documented as part of my research. The way I do this is write a blog post, forever sealing this work in time, and adding it to the public record that is my API Evangelist brain. Since I use my blog as a reference when writing white papers, guides, blueprints, policies, and other aspects of my work, I need as many references to usable standards like this.</p>

<p>I am going to just share the introduction from Irakli’s draft, as it says it all:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The vast majority of modern APIs driving data to web and mobile applications use HTTP [RFC7230] as a transport protocol. The health and uptime of these APIs determine availability of the applications themselves. In distributed systems built with a number of APIs, understanding the health status of the APIs and making corresponding decisions, for failover or circuit-breaking, are essential for providing highly available solutions.
There exists a wide variety of operational software that relies on the ability to read health check response of APIs. There is currently no standard for the health check output response, however, so most applications either rely on the basic level of information included in HTTP status codes [RFC7231] or use task-specific formats.
Usage of task-specific or application-specific formats creates significant challenges, disallowing any meaningful interoperability across different implementations and between different tooling.
Standardizing a format for health checks can provide any of a number of benefits, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Flexible deployment - since operational tooling and API clients can rely on rich, uniform format, they can be safely combined and substituted as needed.</li>
    <li>Evolvability - new APIs, conforming to the standard, can safely be introduced in any environment and ecosystem that also conforms to the same standard, without costly coordination and testing requirements.
This document defines a “health check” format using the JSON format [RFC7159] for APIs to use as a standard point for the health information they offer. Having a well-defined format for this purpose promotes good practice and tooling.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is an example JSON response, showing the standard in action:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/5bea1128ccada3b26ab534b7e4bb138d.js"></script>

<p>I have seen a number of different approaches to providing health checks in APIs, from a single ping path, to proxying of the Docker Engine API for the microservices Docker container. It makes sense to have a standard for this, and I’ll reference Irakli’s important work from here on out as I’m advising on projects, or implementing my own.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Jan 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories-new/68_174_800_500_0_max_0_-5_-1.jpg" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I am working to understand the value that <a href="http://apis.how/streamdata">Streamdata.io</a> brings to the table, and one of the tools I am developing is a set of APIs to help me measure the difference in data received for normal API calls versus when they are proxied with Streamdata.io using Server-Sent Events (SSE) and JSON Patch. Creating an API to poll any 3rd party API I plug in is pretty easy and straightforward, but setting up a server setup to operate long running Server-Sent Events (SSE), managing for failure and keeping an eye on the results takes a little more consideration. Doing it browser side is easy, but server side removes the human aspect of the equation, which starts and stops the process.</p>

<p>This post is just meant to just outline what I’m looking to build, and act as a set of project requirements for what I’m going to develop–it isn’t a guide to building it. This is just my way of working through my projects, while also getting content published on the blog ;-). I just need to work out the details of what I will need to run many different Server-Sent Events (SSE) jobs for long periods of time, or even continuously, and make sure nothing breaks, or at least minimize the breakages. Half of my project will be polling hundreds of APIs, while the other half of it will be proxy those same APIs, and making sure I’m receiving those updates continuously.</p>

<p>I will need some basic APIs to operate each event stream I want to operate:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Register</strong> - Register a new API URL I wish to run ongoing stream on.</li>
  <li><strong>Start</strong> - Kick off a new stream for any single API I’m tracking on.</li>
  <li><strong>Stop</strong> - Stop a stream from running for any single API I have streaming.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any API I deem worthy, and have successfully proxied with Streamdata.io will be registered, and operating as a long running background scripts via AWS EC2 instances I have deployed. This is the straightforward part of things. Next, I will need some APIs to monitor these long running scripts, to make sure they are doing what they should be doing.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Status</strong> - Check the status of a long running script to make sure it is still running and doing what it is supposed to do.</li>
  <li><strong>Logs</strong> - View the logs of an event that has been running to see each time it has executed, and what the request and response were.</li>
  <li><strong>Notify</strong> - Adding a notification API to send a ping to either myself, or someone else response for a long running script to investigate further.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m think that set of APIs should give me what I need to run these long running jobs. Each API will be executing command scripts that run in the background on Linux instances. Then I’m going to need a similar set of services to asses the payload, cache, and real time status of each API, keeping in line with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/01/17/breaking-down-the-value-of-real-time-apis/">my efforts to break down the value of real time APIs</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Size</strong> - A service that processes each partial API response in the bucket and calculates the size of the response. If nothing changed, there was no JSON Patch response.</li>
  <li><strong>Change</strong> - A service that determines if a partial API response has changed from the previous response from 60 seconds before, identifying the frequency of change. If nothing changed, there was no JSON Patch response.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have three goals with long running script microservice. 1) Monitor the real time dimensions of a variety of APIs over time. 2) Understand the efficiencies gained with caching and streaming over polling APIs, and 3) Potentially store the results on Amazon S3, which I will write about in a separate post. I will build an application for each of these purposes on top of these APIs, keeping the microservice doing one thing–processing long run scripts that receive Server-Sent Events (SSE) deliver via Streamdata.io proxies I’ve sent for APIs I’ve targeted.</p>

<p>Next, I am going to get to work programming this service. I have a proof of concept in place that will run the long running scripts. I just need to shape it into a set of APIs that allow me to program against the scripts, and deliver these different use case applications I’m envisioning. Once I have done, I will run for a few months in beta, but then probably open it up as a Server-Sent (SSE) events as a service, that allows anyone to execute long running scripts on the server side. Others may not be interested in measuring the performance gains, but I am guessing they will be interested in storing the streams of response.</p>

<p>I am a big fan API providers taking ownership of their OpenAPI definition, which enables API consumers to download a complete OpenAPI then import into any client tooling like Postman, using it to generate client SDKs, and getting up to speed regarding the surface area of an API. This is why I like to showcase API providers I come across who do this well, and occasionally shame API providers who don’t do it, and demonstrate to their consumers that they don’t really understand what OpenAPI definitions are all about.</p>

<p>This week I am showcasing an API provider who does it well. I was on the hunt for an OpenAPI of the Docker Engine API, for use in a project I am consulting on, and was please to find that <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#">they have a button to download the OpenAPI for each version of the Docker Engine API right at the top of the page</a>. Making it dead simple for me, as an API consumer, to get up and running with the Docker API in my tooling. OpenAPI is about much more than just the API documentation, and something that should be a first class companion to ALL API documentation for EVERY API provider out there–whether or not you are a devout OpenAPI (fka Swgger) believer.</p>

<p>The Docker API team just saved me a significant amount of time in tracking down another OpenAPI, which most likely would be incomplete. Let alone the amount of work that would be required to hand-craft one for my project. I was able to take the existing OpenAPI and publish to the team Github Wiki for a project I’m advising on. The team will be able to use the OpenAPI to import into their Postman Client and begin to learn about the Docker API, which will be used to orchestrate the containers they are using to operate their own microservices. A subset of this team will also be crafting some APIs that proxy the Docker API, and allow for localized management of each microservice’s underlying engine.</p>

<p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/01/08/i-created-an-openapi-for-the-hashicorp-consul-api/">I had to create the Consul OpenAPI for the team last week</a>, which took me a couple hours. I was pleased to see Docker taking ownership of their OpenAPI. This is a drum I will keep beating here on the blog, until EVERY API provider takes ownership of their OpenAPI definition, providing their consumers with a machine readable definition of their API. OpenAPI is much more than just API documentation, and is essential to making sense of what an API does, and then take that knowledge and quickly translate it into actual integration, in as short of time as possible. Don’t make integrating with your API difficult, reduce as much friction as possible, and publish an OpenAPI alongside your API documentation like Docker does.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories-new/76_135_800_500_0_max_0_1_-1.jpg" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I was integrating with <a href="https://dashboard.clearbit.com/docs#api-reference">the Clearbit API</a>, doing some enrichment of the API providers I track on, and I found their API stack pretty interesting. I’m just using the enrichment API, which allows me to pass it a URL, and it gives me back a bunch of intelligence on the organization behind. I’ve added a bookmarklet to my browser, which allows me to push it, and the enriched data goes directly into my CRM system. Delivering what it the title says it does–enrichment.</p>

<p>Next up, I’m going to be using the Clearbit Discovery API to find some potentially new companies who are doing APIs in specific industries. As I head over the to the docs for the API, I notice the other three APIs, and I feel like they reflect the five stages of transition to the data intelligence dark side.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Enrichment API</strong> - The Enrichment API lets you look up person and company data based on an email or domain. For example, you could retrieve a person’s name, location and social handles from an email. Or you could lookup a company’s location, headcount or logo based on their domain name.</li>
  <li><strong>Discovery API</strong> - The Discovery API lets you search for companies via specific criteria. For example, you could search for all companies with a specific funding, that use a certain technology, or that are similar to your existing customers.</li>
  <li><strong>Prospector API</strong> - The Prospector API lets you fetch contacts and emails associated with a company, employment role, seniority, and job title.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk API</strong> - The Risk API takes an email and IP and calculates an associated risk score. This is especially useful for figuring out whether incoming signups to your service are spam or legitimate, or whether a payment has a high chargeback risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Reveal API</strong> - Reveal API takes an IP address, and returns the company associated with that IP. This is especially useful for de-anonymizing traffic on your website, analytics, and customizing landing pages for specific company verticals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your journey to the dark side begins innocently enough. You just want to know more about a handful of companies, and the data provided is a real time saver! Then you begin discovering new things, finding some amazing new companies, products, services, and insights. You are addicted. You begin prospecting full time, and actively working to find your latest fix. Then you begin to get paranoid, worried you can’t trust anyone. I mean, if everyone is behaving like you, then you have to be on your guard. That visitor to your website might be your competitor, or worse! Who is it? I need to know everyone who comes to my site. Then in the darkest depths of your binges you are using the reveal API and surveilling all your users. You’ve crossed to the dark side. Your journey is complete.</p>

<p>Remember kids, this is all a very slippery slope. With great power comes great responsibility. One day you are a scrappy little startup, and the next your the fucking NSA. In all seriousness. I think their data intelligence stack is interesting. I do use the enrichment API, and will be using the discovery API. However, we do have to ask ourselves, do we want to be surveilling all our users and visitors. Do we want to be surveilled on every site we visit, and on every application we use? At some point we have to make sure and check how far towards the dark side we’ve gone, and ask ourselves, is this all really worth it?</p>

<p><em><strong>P.S.</strong> This story reminds me I totally flaked on delivering a white paper to Clearbit on the topic of risk. Last year was difficult for me, and I got swamped….sorry guys. Maybe I’ll pick up the topic and send something your way. It is an interesting one, and I hope to have time at some point.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories-new/42_16_600_500_0_max_1_1_2-0.jpg" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>The concept of API management <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/06/10/history-of-apis-mashery/">has been around for a decade now</a>, and is something that is now part of the fabric of the cloud with services like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">AWS API Gateway</a>. API management is about requiring all consumers of any API resource to sign up for any API access, obtain a set of keys that identify who they are, and pass these keys in with each API call they make from any application. Since every API call is logged, and every API call possesses these keys, it opens up the ability to understand exactly how your APIs are being used through reporting and analytics packages which come with all modern API management available today. This is the fundamentals of API management, allowing us to understand who is accessing our digital resources, and how they are putting them to use–in real time.</p>

<p>The security of API management comes in with this balance of opening up access, being aware of who is accessing what, and being able to throttle or shut down the access of bad actors–more than it is ever about authentication, and requiring keys for all API calls. If you want access to any digital resources from a company, organization, institution, or government agency in a machine readable format, for use in any other web, mobile, or device application–you use the API. This allows ALL digital assets to be made available internally, to trusted partners, and even to the public, while still maintaining control over who has access to what, and what types of applications they are able to use them in. APIs introduce more control over our digital resources, not less–which is a persistent myth when it comes to web APIs.</p>

<p>API management allows us to limit who has access to which APIs by putting each API into one or many “plans”. The concept of software as a service (SaaS) has dominated this discussion around plan access, establishing tiers of API access such as free, pro, and enterprise, or maybe bronze, silver, and platinum. Giving users different levels of access to APIs, often times depending on how much they are paying, or possibly depending upon the level of trust (ie. partners get access to more APIs, as well as higher rate limits). While this approach still persists, much of what we see lacks imagination, due to the rules of the road dictated by many API startup VC investors pulling the strings behind the scenes. When crafting API access plans you want to incentivize consumer behavior, but honestly startup culture, and VC dominance has limited API provider’s vision, and stagnated many of the conversations around what is possible with API management after a decade.</p>

<p>When you are trying to scale a startup fast you need a narrow offering of API products. If you are operating a “real” business, or organization, institution, or government agency, your API plans will look much different, and you shouldn’t be emulating the startup world. We should be more concerned with value exchange between internal groups, with our partners, and potentially with 3rd party public developers. We should create API plans that incentivize, but not limit access, encouraging developers to innovate, while still generating sensible revenue around our digital resources we are making available. The reason many existing companies are struggling with their API programs is they are emulating startups, and not thinking bigger than the table Silicon Valley has set for us. API management is about measuring and rewarding value exchange, not rapidly growing your company so you can inflate your numbers, and sell your business to the highest bidder. That is so 2012!</p>

<p>When you see API management being used to measure value exchange to its fullest you see all the HTTP verbs being used, and measured. Providers aren’t just providing GETs, measuring and charging for access. They are allowing for POST, PUT, and DELETE, and measuring that as well. If they are really progressive, they reward internal groups, partners, and 3rd party developers for the POSTs, PUTs, and DELETEs made. Incentivizing and then rewarding for desired behavior around valuable resources. POSTed a blog post? We’ll pay you $50.00. PUT 100 records, cleaning up addresses, we’ll pay you 50 cents per update. All you do is GET, GET, GET, well we’ll charge you accordingly, but if you also POST, and PUT, we’ll charge you a lower rate for your GETs, as well as apply credits to your account. API management shouldn’t be about three plans, and generating revenue, it should be about measuring the value exchange around ALL the data, content, media, and algorithmic exchanges that occurs on a daily basis.</p>

<p>API management has done amazing things for allowing companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies to develop an awareness around who is accessing their resources. Look at what the Census has done with their API, what Capital One is doing with their API program, and Oxford Dictionaries are doing with their API program. Noticed I didn’t mention any startups, or tech rockstars? API management isn’t just about revenue generation. Don’t let the limited imagination of the startup space dictate otherwise. Now that API management is part of the fabric of the cloud, let’s begin to realize its full potential. Let’s not restrict ourselves to just a handful of plans. Let’s use it to broadly measure the value exchange around all the digital resources we are publishing to the web, making them available internally, to our partners, and the public in a machine readable way, so that they can be used in any web, mobile, or device application.</p>

<p>This is a simple one. All APIs will eventually need to be deprecated. This is how you avoid legacy systems that have been up for over decades. Make sure the life span of each service is discussed as part of its conception, and put some details out about the expected timeline for its existence. Even if this becomes an unknown, at least you thought about it, and hopefully discussed it with others.</p>

<p>Here are just a few of the common building blocks I’m seeing with API operations that respect their users enough to plan for API deprecation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Releases</strong> - Have a set release schedule, and think about what will be deprecated along with each release, allowing for future planning with push.</li>
  <li><strong>Schedule</strong> - Have a deprecation schedule set for each API. You can always extend, or keep versions of your API beyond the date, but at least set a minimum schedule.</li>
  <li><strong>Communication</strong> - Make sure you have a communication strategy around deprecations. Post to the blog, Tweet out notices, and send emails.</li>
  <li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-wilde-sunset-header-03.html"><strong>The Sunset HTTP Header</strong></a> - This specification defines the Sunset HTTP response header field, which indicates that a URI is likely to become unresponsive at a specified point in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another valuable concept this process will introduce is the possibility that APIs can be ephemeral and maybe only exist for days, weeks, or months. With CI/CD cycles allowing for daily, weekly, and monthly code pushes, there is no reason that APIs can evolve rapidly, and deprecate just as fast. Make sure deprecation is always discussed, and thought about in context of other legacy systems, and technical debt that exists at the organization.</p>

<p>API deprecation is inevitable. We might as well start planning for it from day one. Every API definition upon inception should have an API deprecation target date, 12 months, 18 months, or whatever your time frame is. You may have future versions of the API in place, and in some cases extend the life of an API, but having a deprecation strategy shows you are thinking about the future, considering change, as well as considering the impact on your consumers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2018</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope/builder/filtered/80_168_800_500_0_max_0_1_-5.jpg" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I am working to evolve an algorithm for Streamdata.io that helps measure the benefits of their streaming service. There are a couple layers to what they offer as a company, but as I dive into this algorithm, there are also multiple dimensions to what we all perceive as real time, and adding more complexity to the discussion, it is something that can significantly shift from industry to industry. The Streamdata.io team was working to productize this algorithm for quantifying the value their service delivers, but I wanted to take some time to break it down, lay it out on the workbench and think about it before they moved to far down this path.</p>

<p>Ok. To help me get my brain going, I wanted to work my way through the dictionary sites, exploring what is real time?  Real time often seems to describe a human rather than a machine sense of time. It is about communicating, showing, or presenting something at the time it actually happens, where there is no notable delay between the action and its effect or consequence. All of this is relative to the human receiving the real time event, as well as defining exactly when something truly happens / happened. Real time in banking is different than real time in stock trading, and will be different than media. All requiring their own perception of what is real time, and what the effects, consequences, and perceptions are.</p>

<p>When it comes to the delivery or streaming of real time events, it isn’t just about the delivering of the event, message, or transaction. It is about doing it efficiently. The value of real time gets ruined pretty quickly when you have to wade through too much information, or you are given too many updates of events, messages, and transactions that are not relevant. Adding an efficient element to the concept of what is real time. Real time, streaming updates of EVERYTHING are not as meaningful as streaming updates of only what just happened, staying truer to the concept of real time, in my opinion. Making the caching, and JSON Patch aspect of what Streamdat.io relevant to delivering a true real time experience–you only get what has changed in real time, not everything else.</p>

<p>To help me break down the algorithm for measuring the value delivered by Streamdata.io, I’ve started with creating three simple APIs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Poll API</strong> - A service for polling any API I give it. I can adjust the settings, but the default is that it polls it every 60 seconds, until I tell it to stop. Storing every response on a private Amazon S3 bucket.</li>
  <li><strong>API Size</strong> - A service that processes each API response in the bucket and calculates the size of the response.</li>
  <li><strong>API Change</strong> - A service that determines if an API response has changed from the previous response from 60 seconds before, identifying the frequency of change.</li>
</ul>

<p>This gives me a baseline of information I need to set the stage for what is real time. I am trying to understand what changes, and potentially what the value is of precise updates, rather than sending everything over the wire with each API response. After I set this process into motion for each API, I have another set of APIs for turning on the Streamdata.io portion, which reflects the other side of the coin.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stream API</strong> - This service proxies an API with Streamdata.io and begins to send updates every 60 seconds. Similar to the previous set of services, I am storing the initial request, as well as every incremental update on Amazon S3.</li>
  <li><strong>API Size</strong> - A service that processes each partial API response in the bucket and calculates the size of the response. If nothing changed, there was no JSON Patch response.</li>
  <li><strong>API Change</strong> - A service that determines if a partial API response has changed from the previous response from 60 seconds before, identifying the frequency of change. If nothing changed, there was no JSON Patch response.</li>
</ul>

<p>This gives me all the raw data I need to calculate the value which Streamdata.io delivers for any single API. However, it also gives me the raw data I need to begin calculating what is real time, and the value of it. We are tagging APIs that we catalog, allowing us to break down by common areas like finance, banking, media, transit, etc. This will allow us to start looking at how often things change within different sectors, and begin to look at how we can measure the value brought to the table when events, messages, and transactions are efficiently delivered in real time.</p>

<p>I am going to build me a dashboard to help me work with this data. I need to look at it for a couple of months, and run a number of different APIs through until I will know what dimensions I want to add next. I’m guessing I’m going to want some sort of freshness score on this, to see if something really truly is a new event, message, or transaction, or possibly being recirculated, duplicated, or some other anti-pattern. IDK. I’m guessing there are a number of new questions I will have about this data before I will truly be able to feel comfortable that the algorithm defines a meaningful vision of real time. Right now the algorithm sets to compute a couple meaningful efficiency gains.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Client Bandwidth (BW) Savings</strong> - What efficiencies are realized when working with data in the client.</li>
  <li><strong>Server Bandwidth (BW) Savings</strong> - What efficiencies are realized in bandwidth, as data is transmitted.</li>
  <li><strong>Server CPU Savings</strong> - What efficiencies are realized on the service in CPU savings.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see this calculated for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/12/11/cost-savings-analysis-for-washington-metropolitan-area-transit-authority-wmata-data-apis/">the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) Data APIs in a story I wrote last year</a>. I want to be able to calculate these efficiency gains, but I want to be able to do it over time, and begin to try and understand the real time dimension of savings, not just what is introduced through caching. These three calculations speak to the caching aspect of what Streamdata.io delivers, not the real time benefits of the service. Something that won’t be as straightforward to quantify, but I want to give it a try regardless.</p>

<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope/builder/filtered/80_174_800_500_0_max_0_-5_-5.jpg" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>

<p>I want the algorithm to measure these efficiency gains, but I want to be able to capture the real time value of an API, both in quantifying the real time value delivered by the APIs, as well as the real time value delivered by Streamdata.io–establishing a combined real time ranking. This moves the algorithm into territory where it isn’t just describing the value delivered by Streamdata.io to their clients, but also quantifying the value delivered by the combination of the clients API, and Streamdata.io working together. This is where I think things will start to get interesting, especially as we begin to move Streamdata.io services, and our algorithm into new industries, and adding new dimensions and perceptions to the discussion.</p>

<p>This is when things will start to get interesting I feel. By the time we get to this point, the tagging structure I will have applied to different APIs will have evolved, and become more precise as well. Allowing me to further refine the algorithm to apply a real time value ranking to specific streams within a single provider, or even in aggregate across providers. Allowing consumers to subscribe to the most precise real time streams of events, messages, and transactions, and cutting out the noise and redundancy. This is when we can move things beyond just large volumes of data in real time, but precise volumes of data in real time. Consuming only what is needed, training our machine learning models on exactly what is required, and keeping them updating in real time, allowing us to deliver real time artificial intelligence streams that are updated by the second, or minute, producing the most relevant models possible.</p>

<p>Think of support as a reactive area, while training will be the proactive area of the API life cycle. Ensuring there is a wealth of up to date material for API developers and consumers across all stops along the API life cycle. Investing in internal, and partner capacity when it comes to the fundamentals of APIs, as well as the finer details of each stop along the API life cycle, and CI/CD pipelines will pay off big time down the road.</p>

<p>Every API should be included in training materials, workshops, and potentially part of conference talks given my product owners. If your API delivers value within your organization, to partners, and 3r party developers you should be training folks on putting this value to use. Here are some of the training areas I’m seeing emerge within successful API operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Workshops</strong> - Conduct more of the workshops that I conducted with external consultants like me, as well as make sure they are conducted internally by each group. The first day of the our workshop was a great example of this in action.</li>
  <li><strong>Curriculum</strong> - Establish common approaches to designing, developing, and evolving curriculum for teaching about the API lifecycle, as well as using each individual API. Provide forkable templates that developers can easily put to work as part of their work, and make support materials a pipeline asset that gets deployed along with documentation, and other assets.</li>
  <li><strong>Conferences</strong> - Make sure you are sending team members to the latest conferences. In my conversations during the workshop, this didn’t seem like a problem, but something I think should be included anyways.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like every other stop along this journey, API training can be a pipeline artifact and be developed, deployed, and evolved alongside all other code, documentation, and available solutions. Pushing everyone to not just attend trainings, but also work to develop and deliver curriculum as part of trainings helps make sure everyone is able to communicate what they do across the company. Everyone should be contributing to, executing, and participating in API training, no matter what their skill level, or ability to get up in front of people and speak.</p>

<p>API training will increase adoption, and save resources down the road. It will compliment platform communications, and strengthen support, while providing valuable feedback that can be included as part of the road map. My favorite part about doing API training is that it forces me as a developer to think through my ideas, consider how I can articulate and share them with others, which if you think about it, is an essential part of the API journey, and something we should bake into operations by default.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jan 2018</span>

<p>As I look through the developer, data, and API portals of transit authorities in cities around the United States, one thing is clear–they are all underfunded, understaffed, and not a priority. This is something that will have to change if transit authorities are expected to survive, let alone thrive in a digital world. I’m working on a series of white papers as part of <a href="http://apis.how/streamdata">my partnership with Streamdata.io</a>, on transit data, and the monetization of public data. I’ll be writing more on this subject as part of this work, but I needed to start working through my ideas, and begin crafting my narrative around how transit authorities can generate much needed revenue and compete in this digital world.</p>

<p>I know that many transit authorities often see data as a byproduct, and something that is occasionally useful, and that their main objective is to keep the trains running. However, every tech company, and developer out there understands the value of the data being generated by the transit schedule, the trains, and most importantly the ridership. The Googles, Ubers, and data brokers are mining this data, enriching their big data warehouses, and actively working to generate revenue from transit authorities most valuable assets–their riders. Ticket sales, and people riding the trains seems like the direct value generation, but in the era of big data, where those people are going, what they are doing, reading, thinking, and who they are doing it with is equally or more valuable than the price of the ticket to ride.</p>

<p>Most of the transit APIs I’m using require you to sign up for a key, so there is some sort of API management in place. However, there are still huge volumes of feeds and downloads that are not being managed, and there is no evidence that there is any sort of analysis, reporting, or other intelligence being gathered from API consumption. Demonstrating that API management is more about rate limiting, and keeping servers up, than it is ever realizing what API management is truly about in the mainstream API world–value and revenue generation. Transit authorities need to understand that API management isn’t just about restricting access, it is about encouraging access, and developing awareness regarding the value of the data resources they have in their possession.</p>

<p>I’m sure there is so much more data available behind the scenes beyond the schedules, vehicles, or even the real time information some transit authorities are making available. There is no reason that fare purchases, user demographics, neighborhood, sensors, ticket swipes, and other operational data can’t be made available, of course taking care of privacy and security concerns. Technology platforms, and application developers have an insatiable appetite for this type of data, and are willing to pay for it. The greatest lie the devil has told is that public data should always be free, even for commercial purposes, allowing tech companies to freely mine, and generate revenues while transit authorities and municipalities struggle to make ends meet.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that transit data shouldn’t be freely available, and accessible by everyone, but there needs to be more balance in the system, and API management is how you do this. You measure who takes from the system, how much, and you pay or charge accordingly. Right now, there are applications mining transit data schedules and rider details, and selling leads to Uber, Lyft, and other ride share, further cannibalizing our public transit system. Transit authorities need to realize the value they generate on a daily basis, and understand that API management is key to quantifying this value, and generating the revenue they need to stay in operation, and even grow and thrive, better serving their constituents at a time when they need them the most.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jan 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories-new/52_175_800_500_0_max_0_1_-1.jpg" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’m working through the different ways that transit authorities can generate more revenue from their data using APIs as part of my work with Streamdata.io. Making data streaming and truly more real time is the obvious goal of this research, but Streamdata.io is invested in transit authorities take more control over their data resources, and use APIs to generate revenue at a time when they need all the revenue they can possible get their hands on.</p>

<p>One overlap in the projects I’m working on with Streamdata.io is where transit data intersects with machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I’m not sure what transit authorities are doing with their historical data, but I know that it isn’t available via their APIs, and developer portals. I’m guessing they see historical data about schedules, vehicles, riderships, and other data points as a burden, and once they’ve generated the reports they need, don’t do anything else with it. This historical data is a goldmine of information when it comes to training machine learning models, which could then in turn be better used to understand ridership, make predictions, understand maintenance, scheduling, and other aspects of transit operations–let alone commerce, real estate, and other demographic data.</p>

<p>There is a dizzying amount of investment going into machine learning and artificial intelligence right now, and is something that could be routed to transit authorities to help boost revenue. If all historical data on transit operations was digitized and available via APIs, then metered using modern API management approaches, it could be an entirely new revenue opportunity for transit authorities. Transit systems are the heartbeat of the cities they operate within, and historical data is the record of everything that occurs, which can be used to develop machine learning models for the transit industry, as well as real estate, commerce, and other sectors that transit systems feed into on a daily basis, and have for years.</p>

<p>I do not know what data transit authorities possess. I don’t know how much historical data they keep around, and what is required by government regulators, but I do know whatever there is, it has value. I’ve studied how API management is being used by tech companies for almost 8 years now, and it is how value is created, and revenue is generated, something that transit authorities and leadership needs to realize applies to them in a digital age. They are sitting on a wealth of historical data that would be of value to tech companies who are already mining their existing schedules, and real time vehicle data. Historical transit data, and machine learning just represents one of many opportunities on the table for transit authorities to tap when it comes to looking for new revenue opportunities in the future.</p>

<p>I am working with a number of different groups who are using developer portals in some very different ways once they have moved beyond the concept that API developer portals are just for use in the public domain. With the introduction of the static site shift in the CMS landscape, and the introduction of Jekyll and Github Pages as part of the Github project workflow, the concept of the API developer portal is beginning to mean a lot of different things, depending on what the project objective is.</p>

<p>An API portal is becoming something that can reflect a specific project, or group, and isn’t something that always has a public URL. Here are just a few of the ways in which I’m seeing portals being wielded as part of API operations.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Individual Portals</strong> - Considering how developers and business users can be leverage portals to push forward conversations around the APIs they own and are moving forward.</li>
  <li><strong>Team Portals</strong> - Thinking about how different groups and teams can have their own portals which aggregate APIs and other portals from across their project.</li>
  <li><strong>Partner Portals</strong> - Leveraging a single, or even partner specific portals that are public or private for engaging in API projects with trusted partners.</li>
  <li><strong>Public Portal</strong> - Begin the process of establishing a single Mutual of Omaha developer portal to provide a single point of entry for all public API efforts across the organization.</li>
  <li><strong>Pipeline Integration</strong> - How can BitBucket be leverage for deploying of individual, team, partner, and even the public portal, making portals another aspect of the continuous deployment pipeline.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the most interesting shifts that I am seeing is the deployment of portals as part of continuous deployment and integration pipelines. Since you can host a portal on Github, why not be deploying it, managing and evolving it as its own pipeline, or as part of individual projects, and partner integrations. This is something that static CMSs have have a profound effect on, as well as the integration of YAML, JSON, and CSV static data formats, which can be used to deliver data, content, and configurations that can be used throughout project pipelines.</p>

<p>Like every other stop along the API life cycle, API portals are quickly becoming more modular, and often times more ephemeral, shifting from the days where we just had one single API portal. We are beginning to move beyond just the concept of a single portal, and seeing a mix of API centric destinations that are public or private, and reflect the changing objectives of different teams, partners, and event outside industry influences.</p>

If an API goes unsupported, it might as well not exist at all, making standardized, comprehensive support practices essential. Every API should have an owner, with a contact information published as part of all API definitions. Ideally, every API owner has a backup point of contact to go to if someone should leave a company, or is out sick.</p>

<p>Similar to the communications stop along this journey, there a handful of common support building blocks you see present within the leading API pioneers portals. These are the four I recommend baking in by default to all of your API portals, and anywhere API discovery and documentation exists.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Email</strong> - Make sure there is support available via email channels, with a responsive individual on the other end–with accountability.</li>
  <li><strong>Tickets</strong> - Consider a ticketing system for submitting and supporting requests around API operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Dedicated</strong> - Identify one, or many individuals who can act as internal, partner, and public support when it makes sense.</li>
  <li><strong>Office Hours</strong> - Consider one time a week where there is a human being available in person, or online to answer direct question.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every single API should have a support element present as part of its operations. Each API definition allows for the inclusion of responsible point of contact via email, and other channels–make use of it. Support should be baked into each API’s definition, making it accessible across the API lifecycle, in a machine readable way. Ideally, every API developer provides support for their own work, bringing them closer to how their solutions are working, or not working for consumers.</p>

<p>API support isn’t rocket surgery, but will make or break your API operations if not done well. The APIs that perform the best, will have strong support behind them. The APIs that go dormant, or aren’t reliable will not have proper support. Developers do not think about support by default, which means it will often go overlooked unless a more senior developer, business user, or manager steps up. This is why API operations is a team sport, because there are different skill levels, and personalities at play, and while proper support won’t be everyone’s strength, it is something everyone should be responsible for.</p>

        <p><a href="https://developer.wmata.com/Products"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/washington-metro/wmata-guest-key.png" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I’m spending time immersed in the world of transit data and APIs lately, and found a simple, yet useful approach to helping onboard developers over at the <a href="https://developer.wmata.com/">Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) API</a>. When you you click on <a href="https://developer.wmata.com/Products">their products page</a> (not sure why they use this name), you get a guest API key which allows you try out the API, and kick the tires. Of course, you can’t use the key in production applications, as it is rate limited and can change at any time, but the concept is simple, and provides an example which other API providers might want to consider.</p>

<p>In my days as the API Evangelist I’ve seen API providers do this in a variety of ways, by providing sample API URLs complete with an API key, and by embedding a key in the OpenAPI definition, so that the interactive documentation picks up the key and will allow developers to make live, interactive API calls–to name a few. No matter what your approach, providing a guest key for users to play around without signing up makes a lot of sense. Of course, you want to rotate this key regularly, or at least be monitoring it to see what IP addresses it is being called from, and maybe understand how its being used–you never know, it might reveal some interesting use cases.</p>

<p>Whatever your approach, get out of the way of your consumers. Don’t expect that everyone is going to want to sign up for an account so that they can learn about what your API does. Not everyone is interested in handing over their email address, and other information just so they can test drive. If you have API management in place (which you should), it really doesn’t take much to generate test users, applications, and keys, monitor them, and rotate them on a regular basis. I recommend using them like you would marketing tags, and strategically place them into different blog posts, documentation, widgets, and other resources–you never know what other insight you might learn about how people are putting your resources to use.</p>

<p><em>This is a series of stories I’m doing as part of <a href="http://basics.apievangelist.com/">my API Transit work</a>, trying to map out a simple journey that some of my clients can take to rethink some of the basics of their API strategy. I’m using a subway map visual, and experience to help map out the journey, which I’m calling <a href="http://basics.apievangelist.com/">API transit</a>–leveraging the verb form of transit, to describe what every API should go through.</em></p>

<p>Moving further towards the human side of this API transit journey, I’d like to focus on one of the areas that I see cause the failure and stagnation of many API operations–basic communications. A lack of communication, and one way communication are the most common contributors to APIs not reaching their intended audience, and establishing much needed feedback loops that contribute to the API road map. This portion of the journey is not rocket science, it just take stepping back from the tech for a moment and thinking about the humans involved.</p>

<p>When you look at Twitter, Twilio, Slack, Amazon, SalesForce, and the other leading API pioneers you see a handful of communication building blocks present across all of them. These are just a few of the communication elements that should be present in both internal, as well as external or publicly available API operations.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blogs</strong> - Make blogs a default part of ALL portals, whether partner, public, or internal. They don’t have to be grand storytelling vehicles, but can be used as part of communicating around updates within teams, groups, and for projects.</li>
  <li><strong>Twitter</strong> - Not required for internally focused APIs, but definitely essential if you are running a publicly available API.</li>
  <li><strong>Github</strong> - Github enables all types of communication around repos, issues, wikis, and other aspects of managing code, definitions, and content on the social coding platform.</li>
  <li><strong>Slack</strong> - Leverage Slack for communicating around APIs throughout their life cycle, providing a history of what has occurred from start to finish.</li>
  <li><strong>API Path IDs</strong> - Establish common DNS + API path identifiers for creating threads around each API, allowing for discussions on BitBucket, Slack, and in emails when it comes to each API.</li>
</ul>

<p>I recommend making communication a default requirement for all API owners, stewards, and evangelist who work internally, as well as externally. Ensuring that there is communication around the existence, and life cycle of an API, and helping make sure there is awareness across teams, as well as up the management chain. It’s not rocket science, but it is essential to doing business around programmatic interfaces. You don’t have to be a poet, or prolific blogger, but you do have to care about keeping your API consumers informed.</p>

<p>Communication around API operations is easily overlooked, and difficult to recreate down the road. Just put it in place from the beginning, and don’t worry about activity levels. Be genuine in what you publish and share, and be responsive and open with your readers. Whenever possible make things a two-way street, allowing readers to share their thoughts. Track everything, and route it back into your road map, leveraging all communications as part of the API feedback loop.</p>

<p>Everyone wants their API to be used. We all suffer from “if we build it, they will come” syndrome in the world of APIs. If we craft a simple, useful API, developers will flock to it and integrate it into their applications. However, if you operate an API, you know that getting the attention of developers, and standing out amongst the growing number of APIs is easier said than done. Even if your API truly does bring the value you envision to the table, getting people to discover this value, and invest the time into integrating it into the platforms, products, and services takes a significant amount of work–requiring that you remove all possible obstacles and friction from any possible integration opportunity.</p>

<p>One way we can remove obstacles for possible integrations is by allowing for ALL types of applications–even other APIs. If you think about it, APIs are just another type of application, and one that many API providers I’ve talked with either haven’t thought about at all, or haven’t thought about very deeply and restrict this use case, as they see it as directly competing with their interests. Why would you want to prevent someone from reselling your API, if it brings you traffic, sales, and the other value your API brings to your company, organization, institution, or government agency? If a potential API consumer has an audience, and wants to private label your API, how does that hurt your business? If you have proper API management in place, and have a partner agreement in place with them, how is it different than any other application?</p>

<p>I’ve been profiling companies as part of my partnership with <a href="http://apis.how/streamdata">Streamdata.io</a>, looking for opportunities to deliver real time streaming APIs on top of existing web APIs. Ideally, API providers become a Streamdata.io customer, but we are also looking to enable other businesses to step up and resell existing APIs as a streaming version. However, in some of the conversations I’m having, people are concerned about whether or not API provider’s terms of service will allow this. These developers are worried that revenue generation through the reselling of an existing API as something that would ruffle the feathers of their API provide, and result in getting their API keys turned off. Which is a completely valid concern, and something that is spelled out in some terms of service, but I’d say is often left more as an unknown, resulting in this type of apprehension from developers.</p>

<p>Reselling APIs is something I’m exploring more as part of my API partner research. Which APIs encourage reselling, white and private labeling, and OEM partnerships? Which APIs forbid the reselling of their API? As well as which APIs have not discussed it all. I’d love to hear your thoughts as an API provider, or someone who is selling their services to the API space. What are your thoughts on reselling your API, and have you had conversations with potential providers on this subject. I am going to explore this with Streamdat.io, APIMATIC, and other companies I already work with, as well as reach out to some API providers I’d like to resell as a streaming API using Streadmata.io and see what they say. It’s an interesting conversation, which I think we’ll see more discussion around in 2018.</p>

<p>Hopefully you already have your own security practices in place, with the ability to scan for vulnerabilities, and understand where security problems might exist. If you do, I’m guessing you probably already have procedures and protocols around reporting, and handling security problems across teams. Ideally, your API security practices are more about prevention than they are about responding to a crisis, but your overall strategy should have plans in place for addressing both ends of the spectrum.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in the wider API space, much of the conversation around API security has been slowed by many people feeling like their API management solutions were doing everything that is needed. Luckily, in 2017 we began to see this thaw a bit and some API security focused solutions began to appear on the market, as well as some existing players began tuning into to address the specific concerns of API security, beyond the desktop, web, and other common areas of concern.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://zaproxy.blogspot.com/2017/06/scanning-apis-with-zap.html"><strong>Scanning APIs with OWASP Zap</strong></a> - OWASP is the top place for understanding security vulnerabilities of web applications, and they are expanding their focus to include APIs.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.42crunch.com/"><strong>42 Crunch</strong></a> - A new, OpenAPI driven API security solution for helping deliver policies across API operations.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet"><strong>OWASP REST Security Cheat Sheet</strong></a> - A checklist of considerations when it comes to API security out of OWASP.</li>
</ul>

<p>After crafting this stop along the API lifecycle I wanted to make sure and include API discovery in the conversation. API definitions like OpenAPI, and a solid API discovery strategy helps provide the details of the surface area of API operations, allowing for easier scanning and securing of existing infrastructure. Another area that significantly introduces security benefits is making logging a first class citizen, allowing the DNS, gateway, code, server, and database layers to analyzed for vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>I prefer keeping this security stop short and sweet, as I know from experience that not all my readers have a strategy in place, and I want to give them a handful of options to consider as they look to get started. Many groups have been focusing on web and mobile security, but are just getting started thinking about API security. As APIs move out of the shadows behind mobile applications, and the number of threats increase, companies, institutions, and government agencies are getting more nervous, increasing the need for more API security storytelling here on my site.</p>

<p>One of aspects of a project I’ve been assisting with recently involves helping define, implement, and organize the usage of OpenAPI vendor extensions across a distributed microservice development team. When I first began advising this group, I introduced them to the concept of extending the OpenAPI definition using x-extension format, expanding the teams approach to how they use the OpenAPI specification. They hadn’t heard that you can extend OpenAPI beyond what the specification brings to the table, allowing them to make it deliver exactly what they needed.</p>

<p>Within this project each microservice exists in its own Github repository, with an OpenAPI definition available in the root, defining the surface area of the API. At the organizational level, I have a script that will loop through all Github repos, spider each OpenAPI looking for any x-extensions, and then it aggregates them into a single master list of OpenAPI vendor extensions that are used across all APIs. I then take the list, and add descriptions to each verified extension, and when I come across ones I haven’t seen before I reach out to microservice owners to understand what the vendor extension is used for, and ensure it is in alignment with overall API governance for the project.</p>

<p>I am looking to encourage API designers, developers, and architects to extend OpenAPI. I am also looking to help them be responsible with this power, and make sure they are doing it for good reasons. I am also looking to organize, then educate across teams regarding how different groups are using OpenAPI vendor extensions, and incentivize the reuse and standardization of these extensions. I see vendor extensions as an area for potential innovation when it comes to defining what an API is capable of, as well as the relationship each microservice has with its supporting architecture. Acting for a relief valve for the often perceived constraints of the OpenAPI specification.</p>

<p>This project reminded me that I need to make sure and add a reminder to pick my head up each week and spend time aggregating vendor extensions from across the API space. <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">I have a section dedicated to them in my OpenAPI toolbox</a>, but I haven’t added anything to it recently. OpenAPI Vendor extensions are an important way to learn about how companies are extending the specification, and similar to what I’m doing for this individual project, it is important to aggregate and organize them so people in the community can learn from them, and reuse them whenever possible.</p>

<p>You hear me say it all the time–if you are selling services and tooling to the API sector, you should have an API. In support of this way of thinking I like to highlight the API service providers I work with who follow this philosophy, and today’s example is from (Postman](https://getpostman.com). If you aren’t familiar with Postman, I recommend getting acquainted. It is an indispensable tool for integrating, consuming, and collaborating around the APIs you depend on, and are developing. Postman is essential to working with APIs in 2018, no matter whether you are developing them, or integrating with 3rd party APIs.</p>

<p>Further amplifying the usefulness of Postman as a client tool, <a href="https://docs.api.getpostman.com">the Postman API</a> reflects the heart of what Postman does as not just a client, but a complete life cycle tool. The Postman API provides five separate APIs, allowing you orchestration your API integration, consumption, and collaboration environment.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.api.getpostman.com/#8ca888b7-ef54-f3b4-312f-3f3e2e2cf04e"><strong>Collections</strong></a> - The /collections endpoint returns a list of all collections that are accessible by you. The list includes your own collections and the collections that you have subscribed to.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.api.getpostman.com/#a237ffbe-0444-b394-a2c4-b99f691931cf"><strong>Environments</strong></a> - The /environments endpoint returns a list of all environments that belong to you. The response contains an array of environments’ information containing the name, id, owner and uid of each environment.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.api.getpostman.com/#ef6bef63-0b8e-1a70-dd88-c7c1b94f8dab"><strong>Mocks</strong></a> - This endpoint fetches all the mocks that you have created.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.api.getpostman.com/#993648ea-7b28-9636-f532-1ef8a74ff093"><strong>Monitors</strong></a> - The /monitors endpoint returns a list of all monitors that are accessible by you. The response contains an array of monitors information containing the name, id, owner and uid of each monitor.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.api.getpostman.com/#1ddc0a3c-d5ff-b062-d0fb-9e6086be0536"><strong>User</strong></a> - The /me endpoint allows you to fetch relevant information pertaining to the API Key being used.</li>
</ul>

<p>The user, collections, and environments APIs reflect the heart of the Postman API client, where mocks and monitors reflects its move to be a full API life cycle solution. This stack of APIs, and the Postman as a client tool reflects how API development, as well as API operation should be conducted. You should be maintaining collections of APIs that exist within many environments, and you should always be mocking interfaces as you are defining, designing, and developing them. You should then also be monitoring all the APIs you depend–whether or not the APIs are yours. If you depend on APIs, you should be monitoring them.</p>

<p>I’ve long been advocating that someone development an API environment management solution for API developers, providing a single place we can define, store, and share the configuration, keys, and other aspects of integration with the APIs we depend on. The Postman collections and environment APIs is essentially this, plus you get all the added benefits of the services and tooling that already exist as part of the platform. Demonstrating why as an API service provider, you want to be following your own advice and having an API, because you never know when the core of your solution, or even one of the features could potentially become baked into other applications and services, and be the next killer feature developers can’t do without.</p>

<p>Every API should be tested to ensure it delivers what is expected of it. All code being deployed should meet required unit and code tests, but increasingly API testing is adding another layer of assurance to existing build processes, even going so far as halting CI/CD workflows if tests fail. API testing is another area where API definitions are delivering, allowing tests to be built from existing artifacts, and allowing detailed assertions to be associated with tests to add to and evolve the existing definitions.</p>

<p>API testing has grown over the last couple of years to include a variety of open source solutions, as well as cloud service providers. Most of the quality solutions allow you to import your OpenAPI, and automate the testing via APIs. Here are a few of the solutions I recommend considering as you think about how API testing can be introduced into your API operations.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a> - An API testing service that uses OpenAPI for importing and exporting of API tests and assertions.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/CacheControl/hippie-swagger">Hippie-Swagger</a> - An open source solution for testing your OpenAPI defined APIs.</li>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/">Spring Cloud Contract</a> - Spring Cloud Contract is an umbrella project holding solutions that help users in successfully implementing the Consumer Driven Contracts approach.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/scripts/test_scripts">Postman Testing</a> - With Postman you can write and run tests for each request using the JavaScript language.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.frisbyjs.com/">Frisby.js</a> - Frisby is a REST API testing framework built on Node.js and Jasmine that makes testing API endpoints easy, fast, and fun.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are numerous ways to augment API testing on top of your existing testing strategy. More of these providers are integrating with Jenkins and other CI/CD solutions, allowing API testing to deeply integrate with existing pipelines. My recommendation is that the artifacts from these tests and assertions also live alongside OpenAPI and other artifacts and are used as part of the overall definition strategy, widening the meaning of “contract” to apply across all stops along the lifecycle–not just testing.</p>

<p>While API testing may seem like common sense, I’d say that more than 50% of the organizations I’m talking with do not actively test all their APIs. Of the ones that do, I’d say less than half get very granular in their testing or follow test driven development philosophies. This is where service providers like Runscope deliver, helping bring the tools and expertise to the table, allowing you to get up and running in a cloud environment, building on a platform, rather than started from scratch when it comes to your API testing.</p>

<p>Software Development Kits (SDKs), and code libraries in a variety of programming languages have always been a hallmark of API operations. Some API pundits feel that SDKs aren’t worth the effort to maintain, and keep in development alongside the rest of API operations, while others have done well delivering robust SDKs that span very valuable API stacks–consider the AWS JavaScript SDK as an example. Amidst this debate, SDKs continue to maintain their presence, and even have been evolving to support a more continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) approach to delivering APIs and the applications that depend on them.</p>

<p>Supporting SDKs in a variety of programming languages can be difficult for some API providers. Luckily there is tooling available that help auto-generate SDKs from API definitions, helping make the SDK part of the conversation a little smoother. Of course, it depends on the scope and complexity of your APIs, but increasingly auto-generated SDKs and code as part of a CI/CD process is becoming the normal way of getting things done, whether you are just making them available to your API consumers, or you are actually doing the consuming yourself.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen">Swagger Codegen</a> - The leading open source effort for generating SDKs from OpenAPI.</li>
  <li><a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC</a> - The leading service for generating SDKs from OpenAPI, and including as part of existing CI/CD efforts.</li>
  <li><a href="https://restunited.com/">RESTUnited</a> - The easiest way to generate SDKs (REST API libraries):
PHP, Python, Ruby, ActionScript (Flash), C#, Android, Objective-C, Scala, Java</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on your versioning and build processes, SDK generation can be done alongside all the other stops along this life cycle. When you iterate on an API, you simply auto-generate documentation, tests, SDKs, and other aspects of supporting your services. Not all providers I talk with are easily able to jump into the aspect of producing code, as their build processes aren’t as streamline, and some of their APIs are too large to expect auto-generated code to perform as expected. However, it is something they are working towards, along with other microservices, and decoupling efforts going on across their teams.</p>

<p>Once you realize an API definition driven approach to delivering APIs, the line between deployment and SDKs blurs–it is all about generating code from your definitions. Sometimes the code is providing resources, and other times it is consuming them. It just comes down to whether you are deploying code server or client side. Another significant shift I’m seeing in the landscape with SDKs, are things moving beyond just programming languages, and providing platform specific libraries for managing SalesForce, AWS, Docker, and other common components of our operations–further evolving the notion of what an SDK is and does in 2018.</p>

<p>I’m providing API guidance on a project being delivered to a government agency, as part of <a href="https://skylight.digital/">my Skylight partnership</a>, and found myself spending more time looking around <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/">the AWS compliance department</a>. You can find details on certifications, regulations, laws, and frameworks ranging from HIPPA and FERPA to FedRAMP, so that it can be used by federal government agencies in the United States, and other countries. You can find <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/">a list of services that are in scope</a>, and track on their progress when it comes to compliance across this complex web of compliance rules. I’ve been primarily tracking on the progress of the AWS API Gateway which is currently in progress when it comes to FedRAMP compliance.</p>

<p>When it comes to regulatory compliance, AWS has a significant leg up on its competitors, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/compliance/default.aspx">Microsoft</a>. Both of these cloud platforms have existing regulatory efforts, but they aren’t as organized, or as far along as AWS’s approach to delivering in this area. Delivering cloud solutions that are compliant gives AWS a pretty significant advantage when it comes to first impressions with government agencies, and enterprise organizations operating within heavily regulated industries. Once this impression is made, and these groups have gotten a taste of AWS, and migrated systems, and data to their cloud, it will be hard to change their behavior.</p>

<p>As this whole Internet thing grows up, regulatory compliance is unavoidable. Many companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies we are selling to are already needing to deliver when it comes to compliance, but even for the shiny new starts breaking new ground, at some point you will have to mature and deliver within regulatory constraints. Making AWS a pretty appealing place to be publishing databases, servers, and I’m hoping pretty soon, APIs using AWS API Gateway. If you are on the AWS API Gateway team, I’d love to get an update on the status, as I have a big government project I’d love to deploy using the API Gateway, instead of another industry provider gateway solution.</p>

<p>I broke this area of my research into a separate stops a couple years back, as I saw several new types of service providers emerging to provide a new type of web-based API client. These new tools allowed you to consume, collaborate, and put APIs to use without writing any code. I knew that this shift was going to be significant, even though it hasn’t played out as I expected, with most of the providers disappearing, or being acquired, and leaving just a handful of solutions that we see today.</p>

<p>These new web API clients allow for authentication, and the ability to quickly copy and paste API urls, or the importing of API definitions to begin making requests, and seeing responses for targeted aPIs. These clients were born out of earlier API explorers and interactive API documentation, but have matured into standalone services that are doing interesting things to how we consume APIs. Here are the three web API clients I recommend you consider as part of your API life cycle.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/"><strong>Postman</strong></a> - A desktop and web client for working with and collaborating in a team environment around APIs.</li>
  <li><a href="https://paw.cloud/"><strong>PAW</strong></a> - Paw is a full-featured HTTP client that lets you test and describe the APIs you build or consume. It has a beautiful native macOS interface to compose requests, inspect server responses, generate client code and export API definitions.
-<a href="http://www.restfiddle.com/"><strong>RESTFddle</strong></a> - An easy-to-use platform to work with APIs. It simplifies everything from API exposure to API consumption. RESTFiddle is an Enterprise-grade API Management Platform for teams. It helps you to design, develop, test and release APIs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using web API clients allows for APIs to be easily defined, mocked, collaborated around, and leveraged as part of an API definition driven life cycle. The approach to integration saves significant cycles by allowing APIs to be designed, developed, and integrated with before any code gets written. Plus, the team and collaboration features that many of them posses can significantly benefit the process of not just consuming APIs, but also developing them. Making API clients an essential part of any development team, no matter what you are building.</p>

<p>Using API clients, bundled with an API definition-driven approach, and a healthy API mocking setup, can save you significant time and money when it comes to crafting the right API. What used to take years of development to iterate around, can take days or weeks, allowing you to define, design, mock, consume, collaborate, communicate, and iterate until exactly the right API is delivered. This approach to API development is changing how we deliver APIs, making operations much more flexible, agile, and fast moving, over the historically rigid, brittle, and slow moving approach to delivering API resources.</p>

<p>The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format for providing access to transit data has dominated the landscape for most of the time I have been researching transit data and APIs over the last couple of weeks. A dominance led by Google and their Google Maps, who is <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/">the primary entity behind GTFS</a>. However the tech team at Streamdata.io brought it to my attention the other day that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Bus Time API Supports Service Interface for Real Time Information (SIRI), another standard out of Europe. <a href="http://bustime.mta.info/wiki/Developers/SIRIIntro">I think MTA’s introduction to Siri</a>, and the story behind their decision tells a significant tale about how standards are viewed.</p>

<p>According to the MTA, <em>“<a href="http://user47094.vs.easily.co.uk/siri/overview.htm">SIRI (Service Interface for Real Time Information)</a> is a standard covering a wide range of types of real-time information for public transportation.  This standard has been adopted by the European standards-setting body CEN, and is not owned by any one vendor, public transportation agency or operator.  It has been implemented in a growing number of different projects by vendors and agencies around Europe.”</em> I feel like their thoughts about SIRI not being owned by any one vendor is an important thing to take note of. While GTFS is an open standard, it is clearly a Google-led effort, and I’d say their decision to use Protocol Buffers reflects the technology, business, and politics of Google’s vision for the transit sector.</p>

<p>The MTA has evolved SIRI as part of their adoption, opting to deliver APIs as more of a RESTful interface as opposed to SOAP, and providing responses in JSON, which makes things much more accessible to a wider audience. While technologically sound decisions, I think using Protocol Buffers or even SOAP have political implications when you do not deeply consider your API consumers during the planning phases of your API. I feel like MTA has done this, and understands the need to lower the bar when it comes to the access of public transit data, ensuring that as of an audience as possible can put the real time transit data to use–web APIs, plus JSON, just equals an easier interface to work with for many developers.</p>

<p>I’m getting up to speed with GTFS and GTFS Realtime, and I am also getting intimate with SIRI, and learning how to translate from GTFS into SIRI. I’m looking to lower the bar when it comes to accessing real time transit data. Something simple web APIs excel at. I’ve been able to pull GTFS and GTFS Realtime data and convert into simpler JSON. Now that MTA has introduced me to SIRI, I’m going to get acquainted with this specification, and understand how I can translate GTFS into SIRI, and then <a href="http://apis.how/streamdata">stream using Server-Sent Events (SSE) and JSON Patch using Streamdata.io</a>. Truly making these feeds available in real time, using common web standards.</p>

<p>API documentation is the number one pain point for developers trying to understand what is going on with an API, as they work to get up and running consuming the resources they possess. From many discussions I’ve had with API providers it is also a pretty big pain point for many API developers when it comes to trying to keep up to date, and delivering value to consumers. Thankfully API documentation has been being driven by API definitions like OpenAPI for a while, helping keep things up date and in sync with changes going on behind the scenes. The challenge for many groups who are only doing OpenAPI to produce documentation, is that if the OpenAPI isn’t used across the API life cycle, it will often become forgotten, recreating that timeless challenge with API documentation.</p>

<p>Thankfully in the last year or so I’m beginning to see more API documentation solutions emerge getting us beyond the Swagger UI age of docs. Don’t get me wrong, I’m thankful for what Swagger UI has done, but the I’m finding it to be very difficult to get people beyond the idea that OpenAPI (fka Swagger) isn’t the same thing as Swagger UI, and that the only reason you generate API definitions is to get documentation. There are a number of API documentation solutions to choose from in 2018, but Swagger UI still remains a viable choice for making sure your APIs are properly documented for your consumers.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://swagger.io/swagger-ui/">Swagger UI</a> - Do not abandon Swagger UI, keep using it, but decouple it from existing code generation practices.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/">Redoc</a> - Another OpenAPI driven documentation solution.</li>
  <li><a href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read the Docs</a> - Read the Docs hosts documentation, making it fully searchable and easy to find. You can import your docs using any major version control system, including Mercurial, Git, Subversion, and Bazaar.</li>
  <li><a href="https://readme.io/">ReadMe.io</a> - ReadMe is a developer hub for your startup or code. It’s a completely customizable and collaborative place for documentation, support, key generation and more.</li>
  <li><a href="http://openapi-specification-visual-documentation.apihandyman.io/">OpenAPI Specification Visual Documentation</a> - Thinking about how documentation can become visualized, not just text and data.</li>
</ul>

<p>API documentation should not be static. It should always be driven from OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and other pipeline artifacts. Documentation should be part of the CI/CD build process, and published as part of an API portal life cycle as mentioned above. API documentation should exist for ALL APIs that are deployed within an organization, and used to drive conversations across development as well as business groups–making sure the details of API design are always in as plain language as possible.</p>

<p>I added the visual documentation as a link because I’m beginning to see hints of API documentation move beyond the static, and even dynamic realm, and becoming something more visual. It is an area I’m investing in with my subway map work, trying to develop a consistent and familiar way to document complex systems and infrastructure. Documentation doesn’t have to be a chore, and when done right it can make a developers day brighter, and help them go from learning to integration with minimal friction. Take the time to invest in this stop along your API life cycle, as it will help both you, and your consumers make sense of the resources you are producing.</p>

<p>I’ve been diving into the world of transit data, and learning more about <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/">GTFS and GTFS Realtime</a>, two of the leading specifications for providing access to static and real time transit data. I’ve been able to take the static GTFS data and quickly render as APIs, using the zipped up CSV files provided. Next on my list I wanted to be able to work with GTFS Realtime data, as this is where the data is that changes much more often, and ultimately is more valuable in applications and to consumers.</p>

<p>Google has developed a nice suite of GTFS Realtime bindings in a variety of programming languages, including <a href="https://github.com/google/gtfs-realtime-bindings/blob/master/dotnet/README.md">.NET</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/gtfs-realtime-bindings/blob/master/java/README.md">Java</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/gtfs-realtime-bindings/blob/master/nodejs/README.md">JavaScript / Node.js</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/gtfs-realtime-bindings-php">PHP</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/gtfs-realtime-bindings/blob/master/python/README.md">Python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/gtfs-realtime-bindings/blob/master/ruby/README.md">Ruby</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/google/gtfs-realtime-bindings/blob/master/golang/README.md">Golang</a>. I went with the PHP bindings, which interestingly enough is the only one in its own Github repository. I’m using it because I still feel that PHP has the best opportunity for adoption within municipal organizations–something that is beginning to change, but still holds true in my experience.</p>

<p>The GTFS-realtime data is encoded and decoded using Protocol Buffers, which provides a compact binary representation designed for fast and efficient processing of the data. Even with the usage of Protocol Buffers, which is also used by gRPC via HTTP/2, all of the GFTS Realtime data feeds I am consuming are being delivered via regular HTTP/1.1. I’m doing all this work to be able to make GTFS Realtime feeds more accessible for use by <a href="http://apis.how/streamdata">Streamdata.io</a>, as the Protocol Buffers isn’t something the service currently supports. To make the data accessible for delivery via Server-Sent Events (SSE), and for partial updates to be delivered via JSON Patch, I need the Protocol Buffer format to be reduced to a simpler JSON format–which will be my next weeks worth of work on this project.</p>

<p>I was able to pretty quickly bind to the MTA subway GTFS Realtime feed here in NYC using the PHP bindings, and get at up to date “vehicle” and “alerts” via the transit authorities feeds. I’ve just dumped the data to the screen in no particular format, but was able to prove that I am able to connect to any GTFS feed, and easily convert to something I can translate into any format I desire. I’m opting to go with <a href="http://user47094.vs.easily.co.uk/siri/overview.htm">the Service Interface for Real Time Information (SIRI)</a>, which is more verbose than GTFS, but allows for availability in a JSON format. Now I just need to get more acquainted with the SIRI standard, and understands how it maps to the GTFS format.</p>

<p>I’m looking to have a solid approach to proxying an GTFS, and GTFS Realtime feed, and deploying as a SIRI compliant API that returns to JSON in coming weeks, so that I can quickly proxy using Streamata.io and deliver updates in true real time. Where transit vehicles are located at any particular moment, and details about alerts coming out of each transit authority are the most relevant, and real time aspect of transit operations. While the GTFS Realtime format is real time in name, it really isn’t in how its delivered. You still have to poll the feeds for changes, which is a burden on both the client and server, making Server-Sent Events, and JSON Patch a much more desirable, and cost effective way to get the job done.</p>

<p><a href="/2018/01/10/we-are-not-supporting-open-api-fk-swagger-as-we-already-published-our-docs/">I wrote a piece previously about Consul not supporting Swagger documentation at this time</a>, and the API provider and consumer impact of this decision. I’m going to continue picking on Consul with another API definition story, because they are forcing me to hand-craft my own OpenAPI. If I just had to learn about the API, and load the OpenAPI (fka Swagger) definition into my postman, publish to the repo for the project, and import into other tooling I’m using, I wouldn’t be so critical. However, since I’m having to take their static, and often incomplete documentation, and generate an OpenAPI for my project, I’m going to vent some about their API and schema design, and they short-sighted view of OpenAPI (cough, cough fka Swagger).</p>

<p>I just finished an OpenAPI for <a href="https://www.consul.io/api/acl.html">the Consul ACLs API path</a>, and currently working on one for <a href="https://www.consul.io/api/agent.html">the Agent API path</a>. I have already distilled down their static documentation into something that I can easily parse and translate into OpenAPI, I just need to finish doing the manual work. It is something I normally do with a scrape script, but the difficulties in consistently parsing their docs, combined with the scope of the docs, made me go with hand-crafting after distilling down the documentation for easier handling. I am familiar with the entire surface area of the Consul API, and now I’m getting to it’s intimate details, which also includes it’s intimate lack of details.</p>

<p>The first area I begin stumbling on is with the design of the Consul API. While it is a web or HTTP API, it isn’t following most of the basics of REST, which would significantly help things be a little more intuitive. Simple examples of this in action would be with the LAN Coordinates for a node path, which is a PUT with the following path /coordinate/update – making for verb redundancy in the HTTP Verb and path. There also isn’t a consistent approach to ids and how they are used in the paths, which is a side effect of no real focus on resources, or use of REST principles. Ultimately the API design isn’t as bad as many APIs that I consume, but it’s inconsistencies does it make it difficult to learn about.</p>

<p>The next area I find myself stumbling with is when it comes to the schema and response structure for the Consul API. In the documentation, some APIs provide no insight on what schema is returned, while others show a sample response, and others actually providing detail on the fields, types, and description. Some paths will utilize the same schema, but only reference the need for part of it, and return only what it needs, with no consistency in how it does this. Again, a lack of coherency around any resource model, and just requesting and responding with what is perceived in the moment. The challenge is not all of us new developers are “in the moment”, and the lack of consistency makes it difficult to understand just exactly what is going on.</p>

<p><a href="/2018/01/10/we-are-not-supporting-open-api-fk-swagger-as-we-already-published-our-docs/">As I mentioned in my previous piece, OpenAPI (fka Swagger) is much, much more than just API documentation</a>. In this example, if present, it would act as a design scaffolding for Consul to think through the overall design patterns they use for each of their APIs and their paths, as well as consistently using the schema across the request and response structure of each API. The only reason I’m writing this story is become I needed a break from documenting the inconsistent details of the API. Piecing together a complete picture of the schema from one piece over here, and one piece over there, just so I can learn about the API and put it to use correctly in a project. I’ve read 100% of their API documentation, and hand-crafted an OpenAPI for about 30% of your API, and now I’m wishing the Consul had embarked on this journey, instead of me.</p>

<p>OpenAPI is much, much more than just documentation. It would give that strategic polish to a very tactically designed API. The dismissal of OpenAPI, because they’ve already done API documentation is just one symptom of a very tactically operated API. If Consul had used OpenAPI, it would have given them scaffolding to help them get their API house in order. It would have allowed them to think through the details of their API, which now as a consumer I’m having to do, and provide feedback on, which will hopefully would get included into the next version. With OpenAPI you have the opportunity to expedite this feedback loop, and see the missing details yourself, or potentially mock and provide the interface to a select group of users to provide feedback before you ever begin development.</p>

<p>My frustration with the Consul API isn’t entirely the design of it. It is mostly the incomplete design of it, and their unwillingness to pick up their head and look around, understanding what is good design, as well as what OpenAPI (fka Swagger) is, before responding that they don’t support it. I’m going to keep hand-crafting my Consul OpenAPI, because I see the value of the service, even if I don’t like their API, or the efforts that was put into the API. I’m hoping that they’ll see the light with OpenAPI, and maybe my hand-crafted edition will turn on this light. If nothing else, at least it will provide an OpenAPI that other developers can use, even if Hashicorp’s Consult team doesn’t see the value.</p>

<p>I was talking with the IRS about their internal API strategy before Christmas, reviewing the teams current proposal before they pitched in across teams. One of the topics that came up, which I thought was interesting, was about how to prevent some teams from taking up a defensive stances around their resources when you are trying to level the playing field across groups using APIs and microservices. They had expressed concern that some groups just didn’t see APIs as a benefit, and in some cases perceived them as a threat to their current position within the agency.</p>

<p>This is something I see at almost EVERY SINGLE organization I work with. Most technical groups who have established control over some valuable data, content, or other digital resource, have entrenched themselves, and become resistant to change. Often times these teams have a financial incentive to remain entrenched, and see API efforts as a threat to their budget and long term viability. This type of politics within large companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies is the biggest threat to change than technology ever is.</p>

<p>So, what can you do about it. Well, the most obvious thing is you can get leadership on your team, and get them to mandate change. Often times this will involve personnel change, and can get pretty ugly in the end. Alternately, I recommend trying to build bridges, by understanding the team in question, and find ways you can do API things that might benefit them. Maybe more revenue and budget opportunities. Reuse of code through open source, or reusable code and applications that might benefit their operations. I recommend mapping out the groups structure and needs, and put together a robust plan regarding how you can make inroads, build relationships, and potentially change behavior, instead of taking an adversarial tone.</p>

<p>Another way forward is to ignore them. Focus on other teams. Find success. Demonstrate what APIs can do, and make the more entrenched team come to you. Of course, this depends on the type of resources they have. Depending on the situation, you may or may not be able to ignore them completely. Leading by example is the best way to take down entrenched groups. Get them to come out of their entrenched positions, and lower their walls a little bit, rather than trying to breach them. You are better off focusing doing APIs and investing in moving forward, rather than battling with groups who don’t see the benefits. I guarantee they can last longer than you probably think, and have developed some pretty crafty ways of staying in control over the years.</p>

<p>Anytime I encounter entrenched team stories within organizations I get sad for anyone who has to deal with these situations. I’ve had some pretty big battles over my career, which ended up in me leaving good jobs, so I don’t take them lightly. However, it makes me smile a little to hear one out of the IRS, especially internally. I know plenty of human beings who work at the IRS, but with their hard-ass reputation they have from the outside, you can’t help but smile just a bit thinking them facing the same challenges that the rest of us do. ;-) I think this is one of the most important lessons of microservices, and APIs, is that we can’t let teams ever get this big and entrenched again. Once we decoupled, let’s keep things in small enough teams, that this type of power can’t aggregate and be to big to evolve again.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/streamdata/streamdata-api-evangelist-partner.png" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I am working with <a href="http://apis.how/streamdata">Streamdata.io</a> on a number of fronts when it comes to our partnership in 2018. One of the areas I’m helping them build, is the partner program around their API service. I’m taking what <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/">I’ve learned from studying the partner programs of other leading APIs</a>, and I am pulling it together into coherent strategy that Streamdata.io can put to work over time. Like any other area of operations, we are going to start small, and move forward incrementally, making sure we are doing this in a sensible, and pragmatic way.</p>

<p>First up, are the basics. What are we trying to accomplish with the Streamdata.io partner program. I want to have a simple and concise answer to what their partner program does, and is designed to accomplish.</p>

<p><em>The Streamdata.io partner program is designed to encourage deeper engagement with companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies that are putting Streamdata.io solutions to work, or are already operating within industries where Streamdata.io services will compliment what they are already doing. This partner program is meant to encourage continued participation by our customers, through offering them exposure, storytelling opportunities, referrals, and even new revenue opportunities. The Streamdata.io partner program is open to the public, just reach out and we’ll let you know if there is a fit between what our organizations are doing.</em></p>

<p>It is a first draft, and not the official description, but it takes a crack at describing why we are doing it, and some about what it is. After looking through our existing partner list, and talking about the objectives of the Streamdata.io partner program we have settled in on a handful of types of partner opportunities available with the program.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>OEM</strong> - Our deeply integrated partners who offer a white label version Streamdata.io services to their customers.</li>
  <li><strong>Mutual Lead Referral</strong> - Partners who we are looking to generate business for each other, sending leads back and forth to help drive growth.</li>
  <li><strong>Co-Marketing</strong> - Partners who include Streamdata.io in their marketing, as well as participate in our partner marketing opportunities.</li>
  <li><strong>Reseller / Distribution</strong> - Streamdata.io customers who are authorized to resell and distribute Streamdata.io services alongside their work.</li>
  <li><strong>Marketplace</strong> - Making sure Streamdata.io is in leading application and API marketplaces, such as Amazon Marketplace.</li>
  <li><strong>System Integrators</strong> - Agencies who offer consulting services, and are up to speed on what Streamdata.io does, and can intelligently offer to their customers.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are currently going through our existing partner list, and preparing the website page that articulates what the partner program is, and who our existing partners are. Then we are looking to craft a road map for what the future of the Streamdata.io partner program will look like.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Storytelling</strong> - Opportunities to include their products, services, and use cases in storytelling on the Streamdata.io blog, and via white papers, guides or other formats.</li>
  <li><strong>Newsletter</strong> - Including partners in the newsletter we are launching later this month, allowing for regular exposure via this channel.</li>
  <li><strong>Testimonials</strong> - Getting, and showcasing the testimonials of our partners, and also giving testimonials regarding their solutions.</li>
  <li><strong>Case Studies</strong> - Crafting of full case studies about how a partner has applied Streamdata.io solutions within their products, and services.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have other ideas, but this represents what we are capable of in the first six months of the Streamata.io partner program. It gets the program off the ground, and has us reaching out to existing partners, letting them know of the opportunities on the table. It begins showcasing the program, and existing partners on the showcase page via the website, and invites other customers, and potential customers to participate. Once we get the storytelling drumbeat going for existing partners, and start driving traffic and links their way, we can look at what it will take to attract and land new partners as part of the effort.</p>

<p>Adding another dimension to this conversation, the telling of this story is directly related to my partnership with Streamdata.io. Which means I am a Streamdata.io partner, and they are one of my partners, and this storytelling is part of the benefits of being an API Evangelist partner. As part of the work on the Streamdata.io partner program we are looking at not just how the storytelling can be executed on Streamdata.io, but also here on API Evangelist. We are also looking into how the reseller, distribution, and integrators tiers of partnership can coexist with the consulting, speaking, and workshops I’m doing as part of my work as the API Evangelist. We will be revisiting this topic each week, and when I have relevant additions, or movements, I will tell the story here on the blog, as I do with most of my work.</p>

<p>A coherent strategy to delivering and operating API portals is something that gets lost in a number of the API operations I am asked to review. It is also one of the more interesting aspects of the successful strategies I track on, something that when done right, can become a vibrant source of information, and when done wrong, can make an API a ghost town, and something people back away from when finding. As part of my research I think a lot about how API portals can be used as part of each APIs lifecycle, as well as at the aggregate levels across teams, within groups, between partners, and the public.</p>

<p>The most common form of the API portal is the classic public developer portal you find with Twitter, Twilio, Facebook, and other leading API pioneers. These portals provide a wealth of healthy patterns we can emulate, as well as some not so healthy ones. Beyond these public portals, I also se other patterns within the enterprise organizations I work with, that I think are worth sharing, showing how portals aren’t always just a single public destination, and can be much, much more.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Individual Portals</strong> - Considering how developers and business users can be leverage portals to push forward conversations around the APIs they own and are moving forward.</li>
  <li><strong>Team Portals</strong> - Thinking about how different groups and teams can have their own portals which aggregate APIs and other portals from across their project.</li>
  <li><strong>Partner Portals</strong> - Leveraging a single, or even partner specific portals that are public or private for engaging in API projects with trusted partners.</li>
  <li><strong>Public Portal</strong> - Begin the process of establishing a single Mutual of Omaha developer portal to provide a single point of entry for all public API efforts across the organization.</li>
  <li><strong>Pipeline Integration</strong> - How can BitBucket be leverage for deploying of individual, team, partner, and even the public portal, making portals another aspect of the continuous deployment pipeline.</li>
</ul>

<p>Portals can be used as the storage for the central truth of OpenAPI, and their JSON schema. They can be where documentation, coding, tooling, and other stops along the life cycle live. They also provide for an opportunity for decentralization of API deployment, but done in a way that can be evolved alongside the existing CI/CD evolution occurring within many organization, as well as aggregated and made available as part of company wide public, partner, or private discovery portals. Portals, can be much more than just a landing page, and can act as a doorway to a vibrant ecosystem within an organization.</p>

<p>I admit, it can be tough to turn a landing page for a portal into an active source of information, but with the right investment over time, it can happen. I maintain almost 200 separate portals as part of my work as the API Evangelist. Not all of them are active and vibrant, but they all serve a purpose. Some are meant to be static and never changing, with others being more ephemeral and meant to eventually go away. While others, like the home page for each stop along my API life cycle research staying active for almost eight years now, providing a wealth of information on not just a single APIs, but an entire industry.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2018/01/10/api-life-cycle-basics-dns/">API Life Cycle Basics: DNS</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-dns.png" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>DNS is one of those shadowy things that tends to be managed by a select few wizards, and the rest of an organization doesn’t have much knowledge, awareness, or access at this level. APIs has shifted this reality for me, and is something I’m also seeing at organizations who are adopting a microservices, and devops approach to getting things done. DNS should be a first class citizen in the API toolbox, allowing for well planned deployments supporting a variety of services, but also allow for logging, orchestration, and most importantly security, at the frontline of our API operations.</p>

<p>There are some basics I wanted to introduce to my readers when it comes to DNS for their API operations, but I also wanted to shine a light on where the DNS space is headed because of APIs. Some DNS and cloud providers are taking things to the next level, and APIs are central to that. Like most other stops along the API life cycle DNS is not just about doing DNS for your APIs, it is also about doing APIs for your DNS.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dedicated API DNS</strong> - I’m not in the business of telling you how to name the domain, or subdomain for your API, but you should have a plan, and be also considering having multiple subdomains, separating concerns across operations.</li>
  <li><strong>API Control Over DNS</strong> - DNS is the frontline for your API infrastructure, even internally, and you should be able to programmatically configure, audit, orchestrate, and manage the DNS for your APIs using APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>Regional Consideration</strong> - Begin thinking about how you name and manage your DNS with multiple zones and regions in operations–even if you aren’t quite ready, you should be thinking in this way.</li>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/12/amazon-route-53-releases-auto-naming-api-name-service-management/"><strong>Amazon Route 53 Releases Auto Naming API for Service Name Management and Discovery</strong></a> - Thinking about how service addressing can be automated, as well as standardized as part of the life cycle.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"><strong>CloudFlare</strong></a> - You may not use them as a provider, but tune in and study the way CloudFlare does their DNS, as well as provides APIs for managing DNS.</li>
</ul>

<p>DNS should be a prominent part of API operations, even with internal APIs. It is the first line of defense when it comes to security, as well as discovery, and allowing developers and partners to put APIs to work. DNS shouldn’t be separate from the rest of the API life cycle, and should be reachable by all developers, with logging at this layer shipped to be included within API life cycle operations. DNS needs to come out of the shadows and be something your entire team is aware of, with transparency around configuration, as well as standard practices for usage  across services.</p>

<p>I can’t emphasize enough regarding how DNS providers like CloudFlare have shifted my view of DNS. Even if you aren’t using them for your primary DNS, I recommend setting up a domain and playing around with what they have to offer. At least tune into their blog and Twitter account, as they are pushing the conversation forward when it comes to DNS, and API access to this layer. DNS in 2018 is much more than just addressing for your APIs, it is about logging, security, and much, much more. Bring it out of the background, and take another look at how it can make a bigger impact on what you are looking to achieve with APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kafka/kafka-protocol-guide.png" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/10/03/looking-at-the-37-apached-data-projects/">I’ve been studying the overall Apache Stack a lot lately</a>, with an emphasis on <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a>. I’m trying to understand what the future of APIs will hold, and where the leading edge of real time, event-driven architecture is at these days. I’m going through the protocol page for Kafka, learning about exactly how they move data around, and found their answers behind the decisions they’ve made along the way in deciding what protocols they chose to use were very interesting.</p>

<p><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/protocol">All the way at the bottom of the Kafka protocol page you can find the following “Some Common Philosophical Questions”</a>, providing some interesting backstory on the decisions behind the very popular platform.</p>

<p><em>Some people have asked why we don’t use HTTP. There are a number of reasons, the best is that client implementors can make use of some of the more advanced TCP features–the ability to multiplex requests, the ability to simultaneously poll many connections, etc. We have also found HTTP libraries in many languages to be surprisingly shabby.</em></p>

<p><em>Others have asked if maybe we shouldn’t support many different protocols. Prior experience with this was that it makes it very hard to add and test new features if they have to be ported across many protocol implementations. Our feeling is that most users don’t really see multiple protocols as a feature, they just want a good reliable client in the language of their choice.</em></p>

<p><em>Another question is why we don’t adopt XMPP, STOMP, AMQP or an existing protocol. The answer to this varies by protocol, but in general the problem is that the protocol does determine large parts of the implementation and we couldn’t do what we are doing if we didn’t have control over the protocol. Our belief is that it is possible to do better than existing messaging systems have in providing a truly distributed messaging system, and to do this we need to build something that works differently.</em></p>

<p><em>A final question is why we don’t use a system like Protocol Buffers or Thrift to define our request messages. These packages excel at helping you to managing lots and lots of serialized messages. However we have only a few messages. Support across languages is somewhat spotty (depending on the package). Finally the mapping between binary log format and wire protocol is something we manage somewhat carefully and this would not be possible with these systems. Finally we prefer the style of versioning APIs explicitly and checking this to inferring new values as nulls as it allows more nuanced control of compatibility.</em></p>

<p>It paints an interesting story about the team, technology, and I think the other directions the API sector is taking, when it comes to which protocols they are using. I don’t know enough about how Kafka works to take any stance on their decisions. I’m just looking to just take a snapshot of their stance, so that I can come back to it at some point in the future, when I do.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/01/02/my-evolving-definition-of-a-robust-and-diverse-api-toolbox/">I published my diverse toolbox diagram a couple weeks back</a>, which includes Kafka. As I continue to develop my understanding of the Apache Stack, and Kafka, I will further dial-in the story that my API toolbox visual tells. The answers above further muddy the water for me about where it fits into the bigger picture, but I’m hoping it is something that will clear up with more awarness of what Kafka delivers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hashicorp/hashicorp-consul-github-swagger-docs.png" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I was looking for an OpenAPI for <a href="https://www.consul.io/api/index.html">the Consul API</a> to use in a project I’m working on. I have a few tricks for finding OpenAPI out in the wild, which always starts with looking over at <a href="https://apis.guru/">APIs.guru</a>, then secondarily Githubbing it (are we to verb status yet?). From a search on Github <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/555">I came across an issue on the Github repo for Hashicorp’s Consul</a>, which asked for “improved API documentation”, a Hashicorp employee ultimately responded with “we just finished a revamp of the API docs and we don’t have plans to support Swagger at this time.”. Highlighting the continued misconception of what is “OpenAPI”, what it is used for, and how important it can be to not just providing an API, but also consuming it.</p>

<p>First things first. Swagger is now <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI</a> (has been for a while), an API specification format that is in <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">the Open API Initiative (OAI)</a>, which is part of the Linux Foundation. Swagger is proprietary tooling for building with the OpenAPI specification. It’s an unfortunate and confusing situation that arose out of the move to the Open API Initiative, but it is one we need to move beyond, so you will find me correcting folks more often on this subject.</p>

<p>Next, let’s look at the consumer question, asking for “improved API documentation”. OpenAPI (fka Swagger) is much more than documentation. I understand this position as much of the value it delivers to the API consumer is often the things we associate with documentation delivering. It teaches us about the surface area of an API, detailing the authentication, request, and response structure. However, OpenAPI does this in a machine readable way that allows us to take the definition with us, load it up in other tooling like Postman, as well as use to autogenerate code, tests, monitors, and many other time saving elements when we are working to integrate with an API. Lesson for the API consumers here is that OpenAPI (fka Swagger) is much, much, more than just documentation.</p>

<p>Then, let’s look at it from the provider side. Looks like you just revamped your API documentation, without much review of the state of things when it comes to API documentation. Without being too snarky, after learning more about the design of your API, I’m guessing you didn’t look at the state of things when it comes to API design either. My objective is to not shame you for poor API design and documentation practices, just to point out you are not picking your head up and looking around much when you developed a public facing API, that many “other” people will be consuming. It is precisely the time you should be picking up your head and looking around. Lesson for the API provider her is that OpenAPI (fka Swagger) is much, much, more than just documentation.</p>

<p>OpenAPI (fka Swagger) is much, much, more than just documentation! Instead of me being able to fork an OpenAPI definition and share with my team members, allowing me to drive interactive documentation within our project portal, empower each team member to import the definition and getting up and running in Postman, I’m spending a couple of hours creating an OpenAPI definition for YOUR API. Once done I will have the benefits for my team that I’m seeking, but I shouldn’t have to do this. As an API provider, Consul should provide us consumers with a machine readable definition of the entire surface area of the API. Not just static documentation (that are incomplete). Please API providers, take the time to look up and study the space a little more when you are designing your APIs, and learn from others are doing when it come to delivering API resources. If you do, you’ll be much happier for it, and I’m guessing your API consumers will be as well!</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jan 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-logging-2.png" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>Logging has always been in the background of other stops along the API lifecycle, most notably the API management layer. However increasingly I am recommending pulling logging out of API management, and making it a first-class citizen, ensuring that the logging of all systems across the API lifecycle are aggregated, and accessible, allowing them to be accessed alongside other resources. Almost every stop in this basics of an API life cycle series will have its own logging layer, providing an opportunity to better understand each stop, but also side by side as part of the bigger picture.</p>

<p>There are some clear leaders when it comes to logging, searching, and analyzing large volumes of data generated across API operations. This is one area you should not be reinventing the wheel in, and you need to be leveraging the experience of the open source tooling providers, as well as the cloud providers who have emerged across the landscape. Here is a snapshot of a few providers who will help you make logging a first class citizen in your API life cycle.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/products">Elastic Stack</a> - Formerly known as the Elk Stack, the evolved approach to logging, search, and analysis out of Elastic. I recommend incorporating it into all aspects of operations, and deploying APIs to make them first class citizens.
<a href="https://logmatic.io/">Logmatic</a> - Whatever the language or stack, staging or production, front or back, Logmatic.io centralizes all your logs and metrics right into your browser.
<a href="https://www.nagios.org/">Nagio</a> - Nagios Log Server greatly simplifies the process of searching your log data. Set up alerts to notify you when potential threats arise, or simply query your log data to quickly audit any system.
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/">Google Stackdriver</a> - Google Stackdriver provides powerful monitoring, logging, and diagnostics.
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">AWS CloudWatch</a> - Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS.</p>

<p>I recommend cracking open logging from EVERY layer, and shipping them into a central system like Elastic for making them accessible. While each stop along the API lifecycle will come with its own logging and analysis solutions, depending on the services and tooling used, logs should also be shipped as part of a central system for analysis at the bigger picture level. Each stop along the API life cycle will have its own tooling and service, which will most likely come with its own logging and analysis services. Use these solutions. However, don’t stop there, and consider the benefits from looking at log data side by side, and what the big picture might hold.</p>

<p>Logging will significantly overlap with the security stop along the API life cycle. The more logging you are doing, and the more accessible these logs are, the more comprehensive your API security will become. You’ll find this becomes true at other stops along the API life cycle, and you will be able to better deliver o discovery, testing, define, and deliver in other ways, with a more comprehensive logging strategy. Remember, logging isn’t just about providing a logging layer, it is also about having APIs for your logging, providing a programmatic layer to understand how things are working, or not.</p>

<p>I’m working through research on the world of <a href="http://transit.apievangelist.com">transit APIs</a> as part of my partnership with <a href="http://apis.how/streamdata">Streamdata.io</a>. From what I’ve gathered so far, the world of transit data and APIs is quite a mess, and there is a pretty significant opportunity to improve upon what already exists. In the course of my research, I stumbled across <a href="https://dcmetrohero.com/">MetroHero</a>, which is an application and API provider that operates on top of the <a href="https://wmata.com/">Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority</a> data and API feeds.</p>

<p>I’m still working my way through their website, services, APIs, as well as talking with their team, but I’m fascinated with what they are doing, and wanted to think a little more about it before I talk with them this week. While their approach to improving upon WMATA applications is interesting, I think applying this way of thought to a government API is more interesting (surprise). <a href="https://www.dcmetrohero.com/apis">The MetroHero API is what I’d consider to be an augmented API</a>, operating on top of the WMATA API, and improving upon the data and services they make available about the Washington DC transit system.</p>

  <li>You must abide by WMATA’s Transit Data Terms of Use; by using our APIs, you agree to these terms of service.</li>
  <li>Any data returned by or derived from data returned by our APIs must be freely available to all users of your application. Any paywalled application that utilizes our APIs must also provide a free tier with access to the same data returned by or derived from our APIs.</li>
  <li>Any data returned by or derived from data returned by our APIs must be prominently credited back to MetroHero. For example, if this data is being displayed to users on a website or in an application, MetroHero must always be visually credited wherever and whenever the data appears or is used.</li>
</ul>

<p>The MetroHero API is not sanctioned by WMATA. The MetroHero team doesn’t charge for their API, while also being very passionate about improving upon the WMATA APIs. I’ve been tuned into what MetroHero does since <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/11/30/licensing-over-dc-transit-data/">I first wrote about WMATA’s terms of service changes impacting them a while back</a>, and I have been intrigued by an API that augments, and improve upon a government agency’s API. This is a topic I’ve been thinking about since <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/17/shutdown-of-government-open-data-and-apis-is-not-government-services-business-as-usual/">my earlier frustrations with the federal government APIs I had been working on getting shutdown during the fall of 2013</a>. An experience that has pushed me to think more about ways in which we can improve upon existing government services using APIs.</p>

<p>I’m looking to craft a blueprint that reflects what MetroHero is already doing. Something that is forkable, and executable. I would like to see MetroHero be the default in communities. While transit is first in line, I’m envisioning a model that goes well beyond just transit, and into other 511 information like automobile traffic and incidents, then move into 311, and 911. I will be adding this blueprint to my <a href="http://adopta.agency/">Adopta.Agency</a> project, and focusing it on the local level, rather than at the federal level. The sub-domain for the project will Transit.Adopta.Agency (not setup), then I’ll add 511,911,311, and others later. I still have a lot of work to do on the transit portal blueprint, so first things first.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jan 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-tools.png" align="right" width="30%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>The need to manage APIs is one of the older aspects of doing business with web APIs. Beginning around 2006, then maturing, and being baked into the cloud and markets by 2016. Whether it is through an management gateway that proxies existing APIs, natively as part of the gateway that is used to deploy the APIs themselves, or as a connective layer within the code, API management is all about authenticating, metering, logging, analyzing, reporting, and even billing against API consumption. This landscape has significantly shifted lately, with the bottom end of the market becoming more competitive, but luckily there are enough open source and cloud solutions available to get the job done.</p>

<p>Over the last decade API management providers have collectively defined some common approaches to getting business done using web APIs. While still very technical, API management is all about the business of APIs, and managing the value generated from providing access to data, content, algorithms, and other digital resources using the web. Here are the handful of common aspects of API management, which are being baked into the cloud, and made available across a number of open source solution providers catering to the API space:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Authentication</strong> - Requiring all developers to register, obtain keys, and provide unique identification with API request they make.</li>
  <li><strong>Service Composition</strong> - Allowing for the organizing and breaking down of APIs into meaningful lines of business, and allowing for different times of access to these products.</li>
  <li><strong>Rate Limiting</strong> - Limiting, and protecting the value of digital resources, only allowing access to those who have been approved.</li>
  <li><strong>Metering</strong> - Measuring each call that is made to APIs, and applying service composition, and pricing to all API traffic, quantifying the value of business being conducted.</li>
  <li><strong>Reporting</strong> - Providing analysis and reporting on all activity, enabling API providers to develop awareness, and drill down regarding how resources are being used.</li>
  <li><strong>Invoicing</strong> - Accounting for all API traffic and invoicing, charging, and crediting for API consumption, to generate revenue and incentivize the desire behavior among consumers.</li>
</ul>

<p>APIs use the web, and API management allows companies, organizations, institutions, and government agency to provide secure access to valuable resources in this environment. API management is about developing an awareness of who has access to resources, understanding how they are using them, and charging or compensating for the value consumed or generated via API access. While much of the conversation in the tech sector is focused on revenue generation at this layer, in reality it is about understanding value generation and exchange around valuable resources–with revenue generation being one aspect of doing business using APIs on the web.</p>

<p>When it comes to selecting an API management solution my recommendation is always keep the relationship small, modular, and decoupled from other stops along the API lifecycle, keeping the business engagement limited as well, allowing you to grow and evolve without lengthy contracts. Every stop along the API life cycle should reflect the API philosophy, and kept small, decoupled, and doing one thing well. This goes for the technical, as well as the business of doing APIs. Increasingly my storytelling about API management is absent of vendors, and more focused on the nuts and bolts of managing APIs, reflecting the maturing and weaving in of API management into the fabric of the cloud.</p>

<p>I was getting ready to write my usual, “wish there was actual data behind this story about a database” story, while reading <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2017/">the Fatal Force story in the Washington Post</a>, and then I saw the link! Fatal Force, 987 people have been shot and killed by police in 2017. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/how-the-washington-post-is-examining-police-shootings-in-the-united-states/2016/07/07/d9c52238-43ad-11e6-8856-f26de2537a9d_story.html">Read about our methodology</a>. <a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings">Download the data</a>. I am so very happy to see this. An actual prominent link to a machine readable version of the data, published on Github–this should be the default for ALL data journalism in this era.</p>

<p>I see story after story reference the data behind, without providing any links to the data. As a database professional this practice drives me insane. Every single story that provides data driven visualizations, statistics, analysis, tables, or any other derivative from data journalism, should provide a link to the Github repository which contains at least CSV representations of the data, if not JSON. This is the minimum for ALL data journalism going forward. If you do not meet this bar, your work should be in question. Other analysts, researchers, and journalists should be able to come in behind your work and audit, verify, validate, and even build upon and augment your work, for it to be considered relevant in this time period.</p>

<p>Github is free. Google Sheets is free. There is no excuse for you not to be publishing the data behind your work in a machine readable format. <a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost">It makes me happy to see the Washington Post using Github like this, especially when they do not have an active API or developer program</a>. I’m going to spend some time looking through the other repositories in their Github organization, and also begin tracking on which news agencies are actively using Github. Hopefully, in the near future, I can stop ranting about reputable news outlets not sharing their data behind stories in machine readable formats, because the rest of the industry will help police this, and only the real data-driven journalists will be left. #ShowYourWork</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jan 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories-new/machine-road_blue_circuit_4.jpg" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’m exploring the different ways that public data access via APIs can be invested in, even with the opportunity for generating revenue, but without charging access to the data itself. I want public data to remain accessible, but in reality it costs money to provide access to public data, to refine, and evolve it. This is meant to be an exploration of how public data is invested in, not how you lock up public data, so please read everything before commenting, as every time I write about this subject, there are folks who blindly declare that ALL public data has to be free, no matter what. I agree (mostly), but there has to be commercial monetization opportunities around public data, otherwise it will never evolve, improve, be enriched, and in some cases available at all.</p>

<p>I am looking for opportunities for public data stewards / owners to generated much needed revenue, as well as commercial interests to come in and augment, and build upon what is already available–going beyond what cash and resource strapped data stewards / owners might be able to do on their own. Here are a couple of areas I’m documenting a little more right now.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Wholesale APIs</strong> - Deploying, managing, and providing access to public data via APIs that are designed specifically for individual consumers. This could be deploying an API on AWS, Google, Azure, or other infrastructure provider, and providing private, or even I guess public access to the data. Delivering a personalized, customized, and performant public data API experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Real Time APIs</strong> - Providing a proxied stream of data from one or many public data sources, going beyond what the data steward / owner is capable of delivering. Charging for the technology, not access to the data itself.</li>
  <li><strong>Cached</strong> - Delivering a cached experience, so that when the primary source goes down, all API consumers are still able to get at historical, or other relevant data without interruption.</li>
  <li><strong>Transformation</strong> - Providing access to the data but in a different format than the source can provide. This is where the line begins to get blurry because technically you would be charging for access to the data here, albeit in a different format. Maybe it could be done as a wholesale API, where you charge for the service, not the data?</li>
  <li><strong>Enriched</strong> - Enriching public data, adding in additional data points, and other relevant data and content that makes it better. Another area things start to get blurry, because again, you are beginning to charge for access to the data. Maybe you would need to have a way to separate public, from the enrichment, I guess?</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are just a couple of examples I’m looking thinking about. Most public data sources restrict the ability to charge for access to their data by any 3rd party–makes sense. In this particular exercise I’m looking at transit data, and how the overall data and API access experience can be improved upon. There are augmented APIs built upon public transit feeds, like we see from <a href="https://dcmetrohero.com/">MetroHero</a>, who is built upon <a href="https://wmata.com/">WMATA</a>. They clearly state that they are not sanctioned by WMATA, and could go away at any point, and make it known the data is freely available, and should remain that way downstream. I’m also looking at building upon <a href="http://datamine.mta.info/list-of-feeds">MTA transit feeds in NYC</a>, making the GTFS Realtime feeds available as SIRI feeds, but it is something that will cost me money, and I can’t afford to just provide for access free, subsidizing other applications without some return.</p>

<p>I’d like to improve upon MTA transit feeds. Make them more usable, and available in a streaming format using <a href="http://apis.how/streamdata">Streamdata.io</a>. I can’t do this in their current format. I can easily proxy their feeds, and transform into a simpler SIRI JSON feed, but then I’m expected to just make them freely available. I’m looking to see how I can do this as a wholesale API, as well as make available in a paid streaming format. I’m not charging for the data, I’m charging for the serving of it in real time? IDK. I am just exploring these thoughts right now. I get where all the concerns come into the picture around making money off public data, and limiting who gets access, however I really want public data to remain available, and improve–this is something that takes money, investment, and the ability to generate revenue.</p>

<p>My partner Chris Cairns(<a href="https://twitter.com/cscairns">@cscairns</a>) over at <a href="https://skylight.digital/">Skylight</a> sent me a link to <a href="https://github.com/ca-cwds">the Child Welfare Digital Services (CWDS) Certification, Approval, and Licensing Services (CALS) API on Github</a> the other day. The API isn’t your traditional public API, but shows what is possible when it comes to APIs at government agencies. The group behind the API has published their <a href="https://cwds.ca.gov/digital_service_design_standards">Digital Service Development Standards</a>, and is actively using <a href="https://github.com/ca-cwds/cals-api/wiki">a Github Wiki to layout the API strategy for the organization</a>.</p>

<p>To give some backround, the Child Welfare Digital Services (CWDS) is for <em>“state and county workers who ensure that safe and quality licensed facilities and approved homes are available for the children and nonminor dependents who need them, the CALS Digital Service Team will facilitate activities related to ensuring that licensed facilities, approved homes and associated adults meet and maintain required standards.”</em> It makes me happy to see that they are investing so heavily in API, in support of such a worthy cause.</p>

<p>Looking around their wiki I found a handful of APIs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ca-cwds/cals-api/wiki/Facility-Resource"><strong>Facility</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ca-cwds/cals-api/wiki/Facility-Children-Resource-v1"><strong>Facility Children</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ca-cwds/cals-api/wiki/Facility-Complaints-Resource"><strong>Facility Complaint</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ca-cwds/cals-api/wiki/Facility-Inspections-Resource-v1"><strong>Facility Inspections</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can also find more about their development process, data model, and approach to security on the Github Wiki for the organization. After looking around more at their Github organization, I found a handful of other operational APIs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ca-cwds/API"><strong>Modules API</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ca-cwds/intake_api"><strong>Intake API</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ca-cwds/case-management-api"><strong>Case Management API</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ca-cwds/dms-api"><strong>Document Management API</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ca-cwds/forms-api"><strong>Forms API</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ca-cwds/geo-services-api"><strong>Geo Services API</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>There was also a <a href="https://github.com/ca-cwds/api-core">Core API</a> which they use as a base across all API projects, standardizing how they do things. Smart! I also found their testing strategy worthy of noting, just so I can add to my research.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Integration Testing</strong> - To run Integration tests set property cals.api.url to point to environment host. Use gradle integrationTest task. In this case token will be generated for default test user, so it’s possible to test environment with Perry running in dev mode.</li>
  <li><strong>Smoke Testing</strong> - Smoke test suite is part of integration tests. Set cals.api.url, use gradle smokeTestSuite task. Smoke test endpoint is not protected by Perry.</li>
</ul>

<p>I like the style of the Child Welfare Digital Services (CWDS) team. They are investing heavily in APIs, and aren’t afraid of doing it out in the open. As it should be. It is important that ALL government agencies do this, so that other agencies can come along and build on their work, making government more efficient, and cost effective when getting business done. All of the APIs above can, and should be forked, and put to use across other child welfare organizations. I notice they are also using OpenAPI (fka Swagger), but haven’t published them as part of some of their projects. I will keep an eye on and update when they do–reuse of API definitions, is even more than reuse of code.</p>

<p>If you know of any government agency who is this progressive, and publishing their API strategy, processes, definitions, and code on Github–please let me know! This type of behavior needs showcasing, and I like to have a wealth of references on my blog which I can cite as I’m traveling around speaking, and consulting with government agencies. This type of API efforts should be default across all city, county, state, and federal government agencies.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Jan 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/matrix-neo.jpg" align="right" width="45%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I was looking for <a href="http://user47094.vs.easily.co.uk/siri/schema/schemas.htm">the API definition and schema for the Service Interface for Real Time Information (SIRI) standard</a>, but all they have were WSDL and XSDs. I am working with <a href="http://bustime.mta.info/wiki/Developers/SIRIIntro">the Metropolitan Transit Authorities (MTA) SIRI feed</a>, which returns JSON, and I wanted to have a JSON schema reflecting the responses I was working with. <a href="https://apimatic.io/transformer">So I took the WSDLs and converted them to OpenAPI using the API Transformer</a>, which kind of felt like that scene in the matrix where the world around him is beginning to turn to liquid as he pokes at it, right before he exits the matrix.</p>

<p>I regularly get the emails and tweets from folks telling me “we’ve done all this before”, when I talk about OpenAPI. I’m fully aware that we have, and have even written a few stories about it. However, translating my first WSDL into an OpenAPI was a new experience for me, and made me think deeply about where we are at in 2018 a little bit more. I was reminded once again of how much we’ve left behind, and how much of this we are slowly recreating as part of the OpenAPI specification, and the other definitions and tooling we are developing. I don’t think all of this is bad, but I do think we’ve never been able to have an honest conversation about all of this.</p>

<p>Over the last decade I feel like there has been two camps, those still committed to web services, and those that had invested in this new paradigm. Web service folks have mostly dug in their heals, and proclaimed, “we’ve already done all this”. While us web API folks moved forward with this new realm, somewhat in denial about where we’ve been. Most discussions have been pretty black or white, meaning it was all new, or all old, and we couldn’t really ever talk about things at a granular level, and exploring the grey layers in between. There was a lot of good in the web services model, and I don’t think we have ever processed what that good was–we just moved on.</p>

<p>When I work with WSDL and XSD it is clear that this stuff wasn’t meant for humans. Something I think web APIs, and using YAML for describing interfaces and schema has significantly improved upon. I think an API design first approach has also helped out significantly, making the interfaces, and schema much softer, and easier to sit down and understand WTF is going on. However I think a lot of the scaffolding and structure that existed in the web services world is being recreated, and we are doing a lot of the same work all over again. I feel like the same polarizing conversation we see around hypermedia, GraphQL, microservices, and other areas of evolution in the space reflect the same damaging effects of technological dogma that keeps us from being sensible about this stuff.</p>

<p>Anyhoo, I don’t think there is any solutions here. I’m just going to develop a robust toolbox for helping me map web services to a fresher web API implementation. I’m not a fan of translating SOAP to REST, but I do like having tools that help me make sense of what was, and create a scaffolding for what can be. Then I just dive in and clean up, polish, and move forward as I see fit. I just had to share my moment of anxiety as I translated that WSDL into OpenAPI. For a moment I felt like Neo in the Matrix, and wasn’t entirely sure whether this was real, or a simulation. I’m betting this is all real, we are just humans, and enjoy being our own worst enemies most of the time, and doign work over and over and over–rarely ever learning from the past. ;-(</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Jan 2018</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gateway.png" align="right" width="35%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>API gateways have long played a role in providing access to backend resources via web services and APIs. This is how web services have historically been deployed, but it is also how modern web APIs are being managed. Providing a gateway that you can stand up in front of existing web APIs, and proxy them through a single gateway that authenticates, logs, and manages the traffic that comes in and out. There are many management characteristics of API gateways, but I want to provide a stop along the API lifecycle that allows us to think about the API deployment, as well as the API management aspects of delivering APIs.</p>

<p>I wanted to separate out the API gateway discussion from deploy and manage, focusing specifically on the opportunities to deploy one or many gateways, while also looking at it separately as a pattern in service of microservices. While code generation for API deployment is common, gateways are making a resurgence across the sector when it comes to working with a variety of backend systems, on-premise and in the cloud. There are many API gateway solutions available on the market, but I wanted to focus in on a handful that help span deployment and management, as well as allowing for new types of routing, and transformation patterns to emerge. Here are a couple of the gateway solutions I’m studying more these days:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/"><strong>AWS API Gateway</strong></a> - The Amazon API Gateway allows for the ingestion of OpenAPIs (Swagger) and the deployment of APIs that connect to a variety of backend services define as part of the AWS infrastructure.</li>
  <li><a href="https://konghq.com/"><strong>Kong</strong></a> - Quickly build API-centric applications. Leverage the latest microservice and container design patterns. And tie it all together with the Kong microservice API gateway.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/zuul"><strong>Zuul</strong></a> - I’m putting Zuul here, because it has some routing characteristics with makes it a deployment, as well as management solution. One you begin routing, you start to do some of the heavy lifting of design and deployment of resources.</li>
  <li><a href="http://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html"><strong>API Gateway Pattern</strong></a> - A pattern for delivering microservices that use an API gateway, and support a variety of applications.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.nginx.com/blog/building-microservices-using-an-api-gateway/"><strong>Building Microservices Using an API Gateway</strong></a> - Designing, building, and deploying microservices introduced the Microservices Architecture pattern.</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll notice there is a mix of several concepts here. API gateway as a pattern, in service of delivering microservices, as well as deploying and managing your APIs. I’m doing this on purpose, to try and show how the API gateway landscape is shifting, and evolving with the microservices evolution, as well as in service of devices, and the Internet of Things (IoT). I think Netflix’s approach to using Zuul reflect the shifting middleware roots of the gateway, while working hard to establish the right set of patterns to meet the demanding needs of a growing variety of clients who are consuming our APIs. You see this landscape with new providers like Kong, as well as other leading web server platforms like NGINX outlining how we navigate this new world.</p>

<p>The API Gateway was always a single, monolithic point of entry in my mind. However, as I use AWS API Gateway in a variety of geographic regions and client accounts, and do more deploying of Kong wherever I need it, I’m beginning to change my tune. I’m working with more enterprise groups who have multiple API gateway solutions in play–the result of many disparate teams, as well as acquisitions, and incongruous evolution along the way. Sometimes this is seen as a bad thing, but when it is embraced as part of a larger API life cycle strategy, and driven my an API definition approach to doing APIs, you begin to see a method to the madness. Something that you can even begin to govern, and orchestrate at scale across many different groups, and thousands of APIs.</p>

<p>I recently worked with a large team on a microservices and API governance training a couple months back, where I saw a repeating pattern that I’ve experienced with other large enterprise groups. They seemed to want the right answers to doing APIs and microservices, instead of developing an understanding of good (or bad) API design, and determining the right way for themselves. The biggest challenge with this perception amongst development groups, is that there is no right answer, or one way of doing APIs and microservices–you need to find the right way forward for your team, and for each project.</p>

<p>I get this a lot within large organizations who are just beginning their API journey–just show us the right way of doing it! To which I usually reply with, let’s roll up our sleeves and get to work on one of your services, and we will start showing you have to craft a simple, sensible, yet robust API that meets the needs of the project. I can’t show you the “right way”, until I understand what the particular need are, and zeroing in on what is the “right way”, takes work, refinement, and crafting f a robust definition for the service.</p>

<p>API design isn’t easy. It takes time to understand what schema is involved, and what role that schema will play in the request and response of an API. It takes work to understand whether the complexity should be spread horizontally across each API paths, or vertically within a single path, using parameters, the body, and other aspects of the surface area of the API. Until I understand the client needs I can’t fully articulate whether we should stick with a simple JSON response, or a more sophisticated hypermedia media type, or possibly even go with something like GraphQL.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I need you to go on this journey with me. I can help ask hard questions, and provide relevant answers about best practices I see across the API space, but I do not know the THE answer. Sometimes there might be multiple right answer, or we won’t know fully until we mock the interface and get to work playing with it. I know you want quick and direct solutions to how you should be doing this, but ultimately it is up to you to do the hard work of learning about what good API design is, and how we can apply it to this particular project. Each microservice within this project might have specific needs, and we’ll have to come up with a variety of solutions that we can apply consistently across the entire project.</p>

<p>I am spending more time helping train teams using OpenAPI as a scaffolding for walking through practical API design, in the context of each service. Going through the paths, verbs, parameters, body, responses, status codes, schema, and fields for each service, one step at a time. It is providing a great way to teach them good API design, in the context of each service they are looking to deliver. Helping them understand that there is no one right answer to all of this. That we just have to invest in their overall API design toolbox. Understand the pros and cons of each decision they make, and develop a healthy understanding of what API design is, both good, and bad–over time.</p>
