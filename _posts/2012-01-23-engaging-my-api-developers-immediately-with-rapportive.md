{% include JB/setup %}<p>When new developers register for the CityGrid API, I get an email with their name and email address.I want to make sure each developer knows I’m here, and available to help them get up and running as quick as possible.Emailing them as soon as they register seems a little too pushy, but following them on Twitter, with my personal Twitter and the CityGrid API Twitter account makes sense.So how do I get their Twitter handle, without spending too much time and derailing whatever I’m working on?In comes Rapportive.</p>
