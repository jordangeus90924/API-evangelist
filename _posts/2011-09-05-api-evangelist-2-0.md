{% include JB/setup %}<p>Sorry about the flood of 25 API Evangelist posts. It was due to the fact I switched to a new blogging system today.I was out growing what I could do with Wordpress, and had too much data and other research I need to link together to show the bigger picture of whats going on with APIs.API Evangelist has always been a hybrid Wordpress blog and custom CMS system system I wrote. Over the last couple months I rewrote my CMS, and re-lauched with 7 new systems: Blog Industries APIs  Building Blocks Service Providers Tools Events These content systems each have their own database, and are linked together by a central tagging system, and I have established relationships between each of the databases as necessary.</p>
