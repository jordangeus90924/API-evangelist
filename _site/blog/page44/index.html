<p>My research for API Evangelist <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">spans 50+ projects</a>, but my core research is focused on seven projects in&nbsp;<a href="http://101.apievangelist.com">API 101</a>, <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com">history</a>, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a> and <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>. In each of these areas, I evaluate who the key players (companies and individuals) are, and the tools and services they produce.</p>
<p>Using my own, custom developed system, I monitor these key players, in all of the research areas, consuming blog posts, tweets, code commits, and much more, trying to establish a deep awareness in each of these fundamental layers of the API economy.  The goal of my monitoring is to help me in producing blog posts (short form), and white papers (long form), while generating valuable analysis for my research, and increasing my own understanding and awareness of the API economy.</p>
<p>I have already produced white papers for <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/whitepapers/api-evangelist-api-101-white-paper-2.png">API 101</a>, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/whitepapers/api-evangelist-white-papers-history-of-apis-2.png">History of APIs</a>, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/whitepapers/api-deployment-pdf-cover-3.png">API Deployment</a>, and <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/whitepapers/api-evangelist-api-providers-guide-api-management-white-paper.png">API Management</a>, and I just now finished one for <a href="http://bit.ly/1pFDGeP">API Design</a>. As with all of my research projects, and the resulting white papers, they are a work in progress, and meant to be a living snapshot of my research. I generate this white paper using the same tools I publish my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">API design research to Github</a>. My CMS lets me format the static content, while also pulling dynamic content from my tracking system(s), and rolls it up into single PDF white paper, you can take with you and learn about the world of API design--it isn't perfect, but provides a good summary of my research.</p>
<p>The other white papers I've produced are all due for an update, but first I need to focus on producing the first version white paper for API discovery, and integration, both areas that are extremely relevant, fast moving layers of the API economy. Looking at the date on my other white papers, June 2013, it seems that summer is a good time to hibernate and produce these new, long form snapshots of my ongoing research into the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-comment-bubbles.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>We are still in the infancy of the API economy, and now with barely 14 years of evolving web API design, we are only just now developing the languages we will need to communicate around APIs throughout their lifecycle, from the first mock of the API resource, to monitoring of a production API in the wild, or making available to a new breed of API search engines.</p>
<p>There has long been standards for describing APIs, such as WSDL for SOAP, and WADL for web APIs, but these formats would never actually enable the meaningful interactions around APIs that it would take to find widespread adoption. WSDL was too programmatic, and heavy handed, while WADL never possessed the incentives for API providers to take the time to define their APIs using the heavy XML format.</p>
<p>It wasn't until early 2011, we would see the first signs of a meaningful language for defining web APIs, that would enable us to have productive conversations, and take action around our API designs. In February 2011, <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/">online word meaning and definition site Wordnik</a>, launched a <a href="http://blog.wordnik.com/calling-all-developers-check-out-our-new-developer-site">new API developer portal, complete with a new way to document APIs</a>, that was interactive, and allowed developers to make live API calls, while learning about an API. In an effort to keep their API documentation up to date, Wordnik has also established a new way to not just document and communicate with an API, but allow us to actually have a shared conversation about the actual design of the API itself.</p>
<p>Later on that year, API management provider Mashery emulated Wordnik's approach, and <a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/mashery-unveils-next-generation-of-api-documentation-1541728.htm">launched their I/O Docs</a>. Immediately after, in August 2011, <a href="http://blog.wordnik.com/wordnik-news-swagger-jobs-nosql-now">Wordnik formally launched their approach to defining APIs</a>, generate interactive documentation, and server or client side code&mdash;which they called <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a>. Over the next two years the Swagger ecosystem would grow and evolve, producing new versions, tooling, and implementations of both private and public API implementations.</p>
<p>During this time, the concept of API design would expand, with tech giants like Google establishing their own approach, which they called <a href="https://developers.google.com/discovery/">Google Discovery</a>, and we would see a new breed of API design service providers emerge with <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary.io</a>. By March 2013, Apiary had <a href="http://blog.apiary.io/2013/03/28/New-API-Blueprint-Format-Roll-Out/">launched their own API definition format called API Blueprint</a>, which allowed API providers to define an API using markdown, and iterate on the design using Apiary.io services. Apiary moved the incentives for defining APIs in a machine readable format earlier on in the lifecycle. Now we didn't just generate machine readable definitions to deploy server code, or generate interactive docs and client side code, we would do it before we actually deployed the API, allowing us to mock our API designs, and collaborate around designing the actual API prior to deployment.</p>
<p>Then by the end of 2013, <a href="http://blogs.mulesoft.org/raml-web-tooling-unleashed/">we'd see another API definition language emerge, this time from enterprise technology provider Mulesoft</a>, called <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>. This new approach to defining APIs, would use YAML to produce a machine readable, yet human friendly way to describe APIs. Now we had four new ways to describe our APIs, and as we push into 2014, we have a wealth of tooling, services, and a selection of maturing API design editors to choose from when planning and designing our APIs.</p>
<p>I feel like we are just moving from infancy, into the toddler phase of communicating throughout the web API lifecycle. We now have several languages to choose from, we just have to work hard to educate people that they exist, help them become fluent, and expand the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">incentives for generating machine readable definitions for our APIs</a>. In the next year, I predict we will see an increased adoption of the leading API definition formats, new tooling and services that helps us design, deploy, manage, monetize, evangelize and integrate with APIs that are driving the API, and app economy--driven from a central, machine readable API definition.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/api-spark/restlet-apispark.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for common patterns that are working within the API space, and shine light on them, work to understand why they work, so that others can emulate these successful patterns in the space. One approach I&rsquo;ve seen work well, in many situations, is a combination of open source and a Platform as a Service (PaaS), and I&rsquo;m going to highlight the implementation of this model by one of the API Evangelist partners&mdash;<a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">Restlet / APISpark</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source For Developers</strong><br /> First and foremost, Restlet is an open source web API framework, that any developer can download, and install to deliver their own API. The community benefits from this, Restlet benefits from this&mdash;open source API tooling is a fundamental building block for all of this to work. Many companies feel that open sourcing their core platform is just giving away their intellectual property, when in reality many consumers of your software won&rsquo;t have the resources to implement on their own, and will still need consulting resources to get the solution off the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS) For Everyone</strong><br /> If you want the power of Restlet, but don&rsquo;t have the time or resources to download and install, and you just want to get up and running with APIs, Restlet provides a PaaS version of Restlet, called APISpark.  Using APISpark, anyone can deploy an API from new or existing data or file stores--no coding resources necessary. APISpark is a natural companion for Restlet, providing an out-of-the-box web API framework, that anyone can put to use--providing a viable commercial layer built on top of the open source Restlet.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Professional Services For Everything Else</strong><br /> Of course, at any stage of development, whether you are looking to put Restlet or APISpark to work, there are professional services to help you achieve your goals. The Restlet team provides professional services, commercial licensing, and other opportunities to get the skills and resources you need to make your API deployment successful. Since Restlet is open source, this isn&rsquo;t limited to the Restlet professional services team itself, a community has evolved around the Restlet platform, allowing for community options when looking for assistance with any API deployment.</p>
<p>I believe the Restlet business model is significant, and represents the future of the API economy. It makes sense to have your core technology be open source, and allow the community to benefit from the availability of open tooling, as well as the platform to benefit from community driven software development.  This model acknowledges that not every will have the time and resources to deploy on their own, and provides a PaaS version, as well as the required paid support necessary to find success with any API deployment.</p>
<p>Open API frameworks are essential to the success of the API economy, and Restlet is a better product because its source code is open. They have acknowledged that there is plenty of money to be made around the platform version of Restlet (APISpark), and professional services surrounding both platforms. I believe this formula is fundamental to the API economy working, and is something other API infrastructure should look to follow.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.nest.com/documentation/nest-api-intro"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/nest/nest-developer-program.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I had several folks point me to the <a href="https://developer.nest.com/documentation/nest-api-intro">Nest API</a> release the other day. I enjoy this, because I&rsquo;m not always the fastest in finding news&mdash;eventually I&rsquo;ll find it, but I rely on my human API monitoring network, just as much as my algorithmic API monitoring network, to bring stories to my attention. I&rsquo;m still reviewing the Nest API release, but one thing that stood out to me, was how real-time is baked into the API by default, and specifically using <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a>.</p>
<p>The Nest API documentation states:</p>
<blockquote><em>Use the official Firebase client libraries (Web, iOS, Java, and Node), which allow you to synchronize your data with a subscription-based, near-real time platform. As you develop your client, you'll find these resources useful: Firebase Data Structure, Reading and Writing data.</em></blockquote>
<p>Nest also provides options, if you can&rsquo;t use the Firebase library (not sure why this would be):</p>
<blockquote><em>In cases where the platform you're developing your integration on has no available Firebase library, you may want to use REST or REST Streaming instead.</em></blockquote>
<p>I track on <a href="http://bit.ly/11RorBM">real-time technology</a> like Firebase as part of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">API trends research</a>, and much like other trends like <a title="aggregation" href="http://bit.ly/11RojT4">aggregation</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/19Li6cS/">reciprocity</a>,&nbsp;I think we&rsquo;ll start seeing these trending layers baked into API operations by default. I&rsquo;ve seen <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">APIs reference default API reciprocity, using platforms like Zapier</a>, and I think we&rsquo;ll see more APIs adopt real-time frameworks by default in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.firebase.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/firebase/firebase-logo.png" alt="" width="190" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>API providers need to focus on what they do best, providing API access to their valuable data, content and other programmatic resources. It is wise for providers to leverage existing providers to deliver real-time, aggregation, reciprocity, <a href="http://bit.ly/10sgWQI">voice</a>, and other complimentary API layers. I will continue to keep my eye out for how APIs are providing a much fuller stack of resources for developers, using their own resources, while also augmenting with other leading technology platforms.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not at Google I/O this week, enjoying some downtime in SoCal, but I am watching some of the news coming out of the event. One thing I noticed, was the addition of monitoring to the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google Developer Console</a>, where&nbsp;Google is slowly working their <a href="https://www.stackdriver.com">StackDriver acquisition</a> into their fast growing API driven, cloud development platform.</p>
<p>You have to request access to the new monitoring services, and Google will open up "Stackdriver's monitoring capabilities available to select Google Cloud trusted testers at no charge&rdquo;. Wile Stackdriver is about monitoring your cloud infrastructure, it also provides <a href="http://www.stackdriver.com/announcing-endpoint-monitoring/">granular level, API endpoint monitoring solutions</a> that you can use to monitor the health of the API resources you depend on in your apps.</p>
<p>When Google makes a move to support a specific feature across its world of APIs, I take notice. Much like when <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/03/14/google-api-access-with-oauth-20/">Google adopted OAuth 2.0 across all APIs</a>, I think their move to provide monitoring services, is a sign that monitoring of the resources you depend is going mainstream--something all web, mobile and Iot API resource providers need to have in place by default in 2014.</p>

<p>The API gathering was just like any other API event I have participated in, with a lineup of 30-60 minute keynotes from API professionals, accompanied by food, drink and networking in between, as well as after the event. The only difference was the API Summit was smaller and all about Edmunds.com, occurring internally at Edmunds.com office, and with Edmunds.com staff in attendance.</p>
<p>The internal API summit format is something that every company should employ.

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about API design lately, the services and tooling coming from Apiary, RAML and Swagger, and wanted to explore some thoughts around what I would consider to be killer features for the killer API design editor.  Some of these thoughts are derived from the features I&rsquo;ve seen in Apiary and RAML editor, and most recently the Swagger Editor, but I&rsquo;d like to *riff* on a little bit and play with what could be the next generation of features.</p>
<p>While exploring my dream API design editor, I&rsquo;d like to walk through each group of features, organized around my indentations and objectives around my API designs.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong><br />When kicking off the API design process, I want to be able to jumpstart the API design lifecycle from multiple sources. There will be many times that I want to start from a clean slate, but many times I will be working from existing patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blank Canvas -</strong> I want to start with a blank canvas, no patterns to follow today, I&rsquo;m painting my masterpiece.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Import Existing File -</strong> I have a loose API design file laying around, and I want to be able to open, import and get to work with it, in any of the formats.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Fork From Gallery </strong>- I want to fork one of my existing API designs, that I have stored in my API design taller (I will outline below).&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Import From API Commons -</strong> Select an existing API design pattern from API Commons and import into editor, and API design gallery.</li>
</ul>
<p>My goals in getting started with API design, will be centered around re-use the best patterns across the API space, as well as my own individual or company API design gallery. We are already mimicking much of this behavior, we just don&rsquo;t have a central API design editor for managing these flows.</p>
<p><strong>Editing My API Design</strong><br />Now we get to the meat of the post, the editor. I have several things in mind when I&rsquo;m actually editing a single API definition, functions I want, actions I want to take around my API design. These are just a handful of the editor specific features I&rsquo;d love to see in my perfect API design editor.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Lingual -</strong> I want my editor to word with API definitions in API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger. I prefer to edit my API designs in JSON, but I know many people I work with will prefer markdown or YAML based, and my editor needs to support fluid editing between all popular formats.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Internationalization - How will I deal with making my API resources available to developers around the world? Beyond API definition langugages, how do I actually make my interfaces accessible, and understood by consuers around the glob.e</li>
<li><strong>Dictionary - </strong>I will outline my thoughts around a central dictionary below, but I want my editor to pull from a common dictionary, providing a standardized language that I work from, as well as my company when designing interfaces, data models, etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Annotation -</strong> I want to be able to annotate various aspects of my API designs and have associated notes, conversation around these elements of my design.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Highlight</strong> - Built in highlighting would be good to support annotations, but also just reference various layers of my API designs to highlighting during conversations with others, or even allowing the reverse engineer of my designs, complete with the notes and layers of the onions for others to follow.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Source View -</strong> A view of my API design that allows me to see the underlying markdown, YAML, or JSON and directly edit the underlying API definition language.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>GUI View - </strong>A visual view of my API design, allowing for adding, editing and removing elements in an easy GUI interface, no source view necessary for designing APIs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Interactive View -</strong> A rendered visual view of my API, allowing me to play with either my live API or generated mock API, through interactive documentation within my editors.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Save To Gallery -</strong> When I&rsquo;m done working with my API designs, all roads lead to saving it to my gallery, once saved to my working space I can decide to take other actions.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Suggestions -</strong> I want my editor to suggest the best patterns available to me from private and public sources. I shouldn't ever design my APIs in the dark.</li>
</ul>
<p>The API design editor should work like most IDE&rsquo;s we see today, but keep it simple, and reflect extensibility like <a href="https://atom.io/">GIthub&rsquo;s Atom editor</a>. My editor should give me full control over my API designs, and enable me to take action in many pre-defined or custom ways one could imagine.</p>
<p><strong>Taking Action </strong> <br />My API designs represent the truth of my API, at any point within its lifecycle, from initial conception to deprecation. In my perfect editor I should be able to take meaningful actions around my API designs. For the purposes of this story I&rsquo;m going to group actions into some meaningful buckets, that reflect the expanding areas of the API lifecycle. You will notice the four areas below, reflect the primary areas I track on via API Evangelist.</p>
<p><strong>Design Actions</strong><br />Early on in my API lifecycle, while I&rsquo;m crafting new designs, I will need to take action around my designs. Designs actions will help me iterate on designs before I reach expensive deployment and management phases.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mock Interface - </strong>With each of my API designs I will need to generate mock interfaces that I can use to play with what my API will deliver. I will also need to share this URL with other stakeholders, so that they can play with, and provide feedback on my API interface.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Copy / Paste - </strong>API designs will evolve and branch out into other areas. I need to be able to copy / paste or fork my API designs, and my editor, and API gallery should keep track of these iterations so I don&rsquo;t have to. The API space essentially copy and pastes common patterns, we just don&rsquo;t have a formal way of doing it currently.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Email Share - </strong>I want to easily share my API designs via email with other key stakeholders that will be part of the API lifecycle. Ideally I wouldn&rsquo;t be emailing around the designs themselves, just pointers to the designs and tools for interacting within the lifecycle.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Social Share - </strong>Sometimes the API design process all occur over common social networks, and in some cases be very public. I want to be able to easily share all my API designs via my most used social networks like Github, Twitter and LinkedIn.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration - </strong>API design should not be done in isolation, and should be a collaborative process with all key stockholders. I would like to to even have <a href="http://etherpad.org/">Etherpad style real-time interactions</a> around the design process with other users.</li>
</ul>
<p>API design actions are the first stop, in the expanding API design lifecycle. Being able to easily generate mocks, share my interfaces and collaborate with other stakeholders. Allowing me to quickly, seamlessly take action throughout the early design cycles will save me money, time and resources early on&mdash;something that only become more costly and restrictive later on in the lifecycle.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment Actions </strong><br />Next station in the API design lifecycle, is being able to deploy APIs from my designs. Each of the existing API definition formats provide API deployment solutions, and with the evolution in cloud computing, we are seeing even more complete, modular ways to take action around your API designs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Server</strong> - With each of my API designs, I should be able to generate server side code in the languages that I use most. I should be able to register specific frameworks, languages, and other defining aspects of my API server code, then generate the code and make available for download, or publish using Github and FTP.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Container</strong> - Cloud computing has matured, producing a new way of deploying very modular architectural resources, giving rise to a new cloud movement, being called containers.  Container virtualization will do for APIs, what APIs have done for companies in the last 14 years. Containers provide a very defined, self-contained way of deploying APIs from API design blueprints, ushering a new ay of deploy API resources in coming years.</li>
</ul>
<p>I need help to deploy my APIs, and with container solutions like <a href="http://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, I should have predefined packages I can configure with my API designs, and deploy using popular container solutions from Google, Amazon, or other coud provider.</p>
<p><strong>Management Actions </strong><br />After I deploy an API I will need to use my API definitions as a guide for an increasing number of areas of my management process, not just the technical, but the business and politics of my API operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Generating of interactive API documentation is what kicked off the popularity of API design, and importance of API definitions. Swagger provider the Swagger UI, and interactive, hands-on way of learning about what an API offered, but this wasn&rsquo;t the only motivation&mdash;providing up to date documentation as well, added just the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">incentives API providers needed to generate machine readable documentation</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong> - Second to API documentation, providing code samples, libraries, and SDKS is one of the best ways you can eliminate friction when on boarding new API users. API definitions provide a machine readable set of instructions, for generating the code that is necessary throughout the API management portion of the API lifecycle.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong> - JavaScript provides a very meaningful way to demonstrate the value of APis, and embeddable JavaScript should always be part of the API lifecycle. Machine readable API definitions can easily generate visualizations that can be used in documentation, and other aspects of the API lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>I predict, with the increased adoption of machine readable API formats like API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, we will see more layers of the API management process be expanded on, further automating how we manage APis.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery Actions </strong><br />Having your APIs found, and being able to find the right API design for integration, are two sides of an essential coin in the API lifecycle. We are just now beginning to get a handle on what is need when it comes to API discovery.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> - </strong>I should be able to organize API designs into groupings, and publish an APIs.json file for these groups. API designs should be able to be organized in multiple groups, organized by domain and sub-domain.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong><a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a> -</strong> Thanks to Oracle, the copyright of API of API definitions will be part of the API lifecycle. I want the ability to manage and publish all of my designs to the API Commons, or any other commons for sharing of API designs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The discovery of APIs has long been a problem, but is just now reaching the critical point where we have to start develop solutions for not just finding APIs, but also understanding what they offer, and the details of of the interface, so we can make sense of not just the technical, but business and political decisions around API driven resources.</p>
<p><strong>Integration Actions</strong><br /> Flipping from providing APIs to consuming APIs, I envision a world where I can take actions around my API designs, that focus on the availability, and integration of valuable API driven resources.  As an API provider, I need as much as assistance as I can, to look at my APIs from an external perspective, and being able to take action in this area will grow increasingly important.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Using my machine readable API definitions, I should be able to publish testing definitions, that allow the execution of common API testing patterns. I&rsquo;d love to see providers like SmartBear, Runscope, APITools, and API Metrics offer services around the import of API design generated definitions.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - Just like API testing, I want to be able to generate definition that allow for the monitoring of API endpoints. My API monitoring tooling should allow for me to generate standard monitoring definitions, and import and run them in my API monitoring solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that API integration is the fastest growing area of the AP space, second only to API design itself. Understanding how an API operates, from an integrators perspective is valuable, not just to the integrator, but also the provider. I need to be thinking about integration issues early on in the API design lifecyle to minimize costly changes downstream.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Actions</strong><br /> I&rsquo;ve laid out some of the essential actions I&rsquo;d like to be able to take around my API definitions, throughout the API lifecycle. I expect the most amount of extensibility from my API design editor, in the future, and should be able to extend in any way that I need.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Links</strong> - I need a dead simple way to take an API design, and publish to a single URL, from within my editor. This approach provides the minimum amount of extensibility I will need in the API design lifecycle.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> - I will need to run JavaScript that I write against all of my API designs, generating specific results that I will need throughout the API design process. My editor should allow me to write, store and execute JavaScript against all my API designs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Marketplace</strong> - There should be a marketplace to find other custom actions I can take against my API designs. I want a way to publish my API actions to the marketplace, as well as browse other API actions, and add them to my own library.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ve reached a point where using API definitions like API Blueprint, RAML, and Swagger are common place, and being able to innovate around what actions we take throughout the API design lifecycle will be critical to the space moving forward, and how companies take action around their own APIs.</p>
<p><strong>API Design Gallery</strong><br /> In my editor, I need a central location to store and manage all of my API designs. I&rsquo;m calling this a gallery, because I do not want it only to be a closed off repository of designs, I want to encourage collaboration, and even public sharing of common API design patterns. I see several key API editor features I will need in my API design gallery.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - I need to be able to search for API designs, based upon their content, as well as other meta data I assign to my designs. I should be able to easily expose my search criteria, and assist potential API consumers in finding my API designs as well.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Import</strong> - I should be able to import any API design from a local file, or provide a public URL and generate local copy of any API design. Many of my Api designs will be generated from an import of existing definition.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong> - I want the API editor of the future to track all versioning of my API designs. Much like managing the code around  my API, I need the interface definitions to be versioned, and the standard feature set for managing this process.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Groups</strong> - I will be working on many API designs, will various stakeholders in the success of any API design. I need a set of features in my API design editor to help me manage multiple groups, and their access to my API designs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Domains</strong> - Much like the Internet itself, I need to organize my APIs by domain. I have numerous domains which I manage different groups of API resources. Generally I publish all of my API portals to Github under a specific domain, or sub-domain&mdash;I would like this level of control in my API design editor.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - Github plays a central role in my API design lifecycle. I need my API design editor to help me manage everything, via public and private Github repository. Using the Github API, my API design editor should be able to store all relevant data on Github&mdash;seamlessly.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>Diff</strong> - What are the differences between my API designs? I would like to understand the difference between each of my API resource types, and versions of each API designs. It might be nice if I could see the difference between my API designs, and other public APIs I might consider as competitors.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Public</strong> - The majority of my API designs will be public, but this won&rsquo;t be the case with every designer. API designers should have the control over whether or not their API designs are public or private.</li>
</ul>
<p>My API design gallery will be the central place i work from. Once I reach a critical mass of designs, I will have many of the patterns I need to design, deploy and manage my APIs. It will be important for me to have access to import the best patterns from public repositories like API Commons. To evolve as an API designer, I need to easily create, store, and evolve my own API designs, while also being influenced by the best patterns available in the public domain.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable Gallery </strong><br />Simple visualization can be an effective tool in helping demonstrate the value an API delivers. I want to be able to manage open, API driven visualizations, using platforms like D3.js. I need an arsenal of embeddable, API driven visualizations to help tell the store of the API resources I provide, give me a gallery to manage them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - I want to be able to search the meta data around the API embeddable tools I develop. I will have a wealth of graphs, charts, and more functional, JavaScript widgets I generate.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong> - Give me a way to group, and organize my embeddable tools. I want to be able to organize, group and share my embeddable tools, not just for my needs, but potentially to the public as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>A picture is worth a thousand words, and being able to easily generate interactive visualizations, driven by API resources, that can be embedded anywhere is critical to my storytelling process. I will use embeddable tools to tell the story of my API, but my API consumers will also use these visualizations as part of their efforts, and hopefully develop their own as well.</p>
<p><strong>API Dictionary </strong><br />I need a common dictionary to work from when designing my APIs. I need to use consistent interface names, field names, parameters, headers, media types, and other definitions that will assist me in providing the best API experience possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - My dictionary should be available to me in any area of my API design editor, and in true IDE style, while I&rsquo;m designing. Search of my dictionary, will be essential to my API design work, but also to the groups that I work with.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Schema.org </strong>- There are plenty of existing patterns to follow when defining my APIs, and my editor should always assist me in adopting, and reusing any existing pattern I determine as relevant to my API design lifecycle, like <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Dublin Core</strong> - How do I define the metadata surrounding my API designs? My editor should assist me to use common metadata patterns available like <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Media Types</strong> - The results of my API should conform to existing document representations, when possible. Being able to explore the existing media types available while designing my API would help me emulate existing patterns, rather than reinventing the wheel each time I design an API.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Custom</strong> - My dictionary should be able to be driven by existing definitions, or allow me to import and and define my own vocabulary based upon my operations. I want to extend my dictionary to meet the unique demands of my API design lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want my API design process to be driven by a common dictionary that fits my unique needs, but borrows from the best patterns already available in the public space. We already emulate many of the common patterns we come across, we just don&rsquo;t have any common dictionary to work from, enforcing healthy design via my editor.</p>
<p><strong>An Editor For Just My Own API Design Process</strong> <br />This story has evolved over the last two weeks, as I spent time in San Francisco, discussing API design, then spending a great deal of time driving, and thinking about the API design lifecycle. This is all part of my research into the expanding world of <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">API design</a>, which will result in a white paper soon, and my intent is to just shed some light on what might be some of the future <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks of the API design space</a>.  My thoughts are very much based in my own selfish API design needs, but based upon what i&rsquo;m seeing in the growing API design space.</p>
<p><strong>An Editor For A Collective API Design Process </strong><br />With this story, I intend to help keep the API design process a collaborative, and when relevant a public affair. I want to ensure we work from existing patterns that are defined in the space, and as we iterative and evolve APIs, we collectively share our best patterns. You should not just be proud of your API designs, and willing to share publicly, you should demonstrate the due diligence that went into your design, attribute the patterns you used to contribute to your designs, and share back your own interpretation&mdash;encouraging re-use and sharing further downstream.</p>
<p><strong>What Features Would Be Part of Your Perfect API Design Editor</strong> <br />This is my vision around the future of API design, and what I&rsquo;d like to have in my editor&mdash;what is yours? What do you need as part of your API design process? Are API definitions part of the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; in your API lifecycle? I&rsquo;d love to hear what tools and services you think should be made available, to assist us in designing our APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/Swift-Federal-Data-SDK"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/images/logos/labor.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It is a common theme, that government of any kind, especially the US federal government is too slow when it comes to adopting new technology. While this may be a popular meme for anti-government crusaders, and is true in many areas of government, there are growing pockets of resistance across federal agencies, who are not just keeping up with the latest technology, but they are leading.</p>
<p>An example of this is out of the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/">Department of Labor</a> (DOL), with their new <a href="https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/Swift-Federal-Data-SDK">Swift Federal Data SDK</a>, which provides a powerful SDK that allows you to work with multiple federal government data APIs, using the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift programming language</a>. Swift is only a couple weeks old, and DOL didn't miss a beat in getting a new SDK published on Github for developers to take advantage of.</p>
<p>In my opinion, we can no longer use the tired old meme, that government is just too slow to adopt new technology. There are an increasing number of examples out there that prove otherwise. In the future when you want to criticize an agency for being to slow in their adoption of tech, don&rsquo;t tell the same old tired story&mdash;point to examples like what DOL and <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a> are up to, and incentivize the agencies to change in a positive way.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/06/18/multiple-types-of-apisjson-for-discovery/">Multiple Types of APIs.json For Discovery</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">18 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working through thoughts around a suggestion for future versions of&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json API discovery format</a>, and as I do with other things I&rsquo;m trying to make sense of, I wanted to write a blog post on API Evangelist. If you aren't familiar with the format, APIs.json is meant to be a machine readable JSON file that provides an overview and listing APIs available within a specific domain.</p>
<p><strong>Authoritative APIs.json</strong><br /> This is an APIs.json that is made available in the root of a domain, that is providing detail on an API that is managed within the same domain. This use case is for API providers to list the APIs that they offer publicly.</p>
<p><strong>Tribute APIs.json</strong><br /> There is an API you use, and want to see it indexed in an API search engine like APIs.io&mdash;so you create a tribute APIs.json. This APIs.json index is not done by the owner of the API, but by a fan, or outside contributor. Tributes will weave together the world of APIs, when providers do not have the time.</p>
<p><strong>Facade APIs.json</strong><br /> There is an API you use, but doesn&rsquo;t have exactly the interface you would want. Some resourceful API architects will be building facades to existing, external API resources. In the API economy you do not settle if an API isn't exactly what you need. The remix able nature of APIs allow for extending by designing facades that transform and extend existing API resources.</p>
<p><strong>Cache APIs.json</strong><br /> If I learned anything working in the federal government last year, it is that APIs can go away at any point. In the future there will be a need for cached versions of existing APIs, providing redundancy and access to some important data and content.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate APIs.json</strong><br /> In fast growing areas of the API economy, we are seeing API aggregation trends, with sectors like social, media, cloud, financial, analytics, and other areas that have matured, and users are depending on potentially multiple API platforms.</p>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-discovery.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Derived APIs.json</strong><br /> I envision derived APis as just an evolution of tribute or facade, stating that I started with a certain API design, but have evolved it beyond what it once was. Not acknowledging where we got our API patterns is a darker side of the API space that needs to go away&mdash;let&rsquo;s be honest about where we learned our patterns and give a nod to these sources.</p>
<p>In the API economy, I think there will be multiple types of APIs that are deployed. As APIs proliferate, if the industry focuses on interoperability and reuse, there will be more types of APIs than the single API provider and APIs.json will help us keep tabs on this.</p>
<p>Not all API providers will have time, desire and the access to resources to publish their APIs.json, and the augmentation, replication and other possible derivatives that will emerge to organically expand on existing patterns.</p>
<p>Right now we are working on just stabilizing the latest release of APIs.json, so that people can get to work on publishing their own APIs.json. My goal with these thoughts is to just explore what is possible, and maybe, if successful some of these thoughts will be incorporated in future versions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say after <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">API integration</a> services and tooling, for testing, monitoring, and transforming API calls is one of the fastest growing segments of the API space. We are seeing solid solutions from <a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a>, <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a>, <a href="http://www.therightapi.com/">TheRightAPI</a>, <a href="http://nomos-software.com/">Nomos Software,</a> and from API pioneer John Musser, with <a href="https://www.apiscience.com/">API Science</a>, but APITools is definitely raising the stakes with open sourcing theirs offering.</p>
<p>The world of API integration service and tooling is rapidly expanding, and only time will tell whether developers prefer running in the cloud, or on-premise, and what features they are looking for, <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">something I've been documenting as I study what each of the companies offer</a>.</p>
<p>I suspect, that along with other API design, deployment, and management tools we'll need a mix of freemium, open tiers, on-premise, and enterprise API integration services and tooling, to meet the demands of this fast growing segment that overlaps with both providing and consuming APIs.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclosure:</strong> APITools is a 3Scale service, and 3Scale is an API Evangelist partner.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/open-fda-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I recently reviewed a new API initiative from the Food &amp; Drug Administration, called <a href="https://open.fda.gov/">OpenFDA</a>. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">I gave a whole list of things that they did right when launching the API</a>, but one item that I thought was particularly interesting, was the actual interactive documentation for the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/">Drugs API endpoint</a>.</p>
<p>I talk a lot about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/21/interactive-api-documentation-with-swagger/">interactive documentation for APIs</a>, something that has become commonplace, and a building block that developers are starting to expect. What is different about the OpenFDA Drug API, is that the interactive documentation provides a visual interface for building API calls, going beyond the interactive, and often very form based documentation that is commonly seen in other developer areas.</p>
<p>Via the OpenFDA Drug API documentation you can actually build an API query by selecting from radio button values, which then updates the resulting URL query, some summary text, and generates a graph visualization of the resulting query. After building your filter, you can run the API query, and see the request and response, which is a common feature other interactive API documentation implementations.</p>
<p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/open-fda-endpoint-visualization.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>The addition of a visualization, that is driven by each endpoint is very interesting, and something I&rsquo;d like to see baked into the DNA of interactive API documentation.  Helping me build an API call, visualize and understand the value contained within an API has huge potential. Currently we have Swagger, API Blueprint, and RAML generated interactive documentation solution, which are pretty similar&mdash;I&rsquo;d love to see more visualizations integrated into future interactive documentation implementations.</p>

<p>After <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/16/api-craft-san-francisco-wrapup-for-june-2014/">speaking at API Craft SF on Thursday</a>, I kept the API talk going with <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">two days of API car talk at API Days San Francisco</a>.  While there is a lot of focus specifically on the car itself, there was also a lot of talk beyond the auto at API Days San Francisco, which was dubbed "Disrupting the Car Industry and Driver Experience with APIs".</p>
<p><strong>Public Transportation</strong><br /> In 2014, you just can&rsquo;t talk about disrupting the car industry, without including public transportation. With smart phones in our pockets, we need to get "smarter" about when and how we drive our cars, but also when should not drive our cars. Public transportation has to be part of the conversation when developers are looking to &ldquo;disrupt the car industry&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Bicycle Culture</strong><br /> I was pleased to also hear bicycles mentioned during several of the talks, and that developers should think about bicycle culture when developing apps. Many automobile owners are also bicyclists, and merging car and bike culture, expanding the opportunities to ride to work, large public events, or just for recreation, should be part of the consideration when developers are looking to &ldquo;disrupt the car industry&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Driving Car Skepticism</strong><br /> It is easy to be captivated by the work coming out of Google around the self-driving car, but I was also so surprised to hear several folks express skepticism around whether or not the self-driving car will live up to the hype, and whether or not we even need the self-driving car at all&mdash;with investment around public transportation being a preferred alternative.</p>
<p>When preparing for API Days, I expected the usual API crowd, educating people generally on the API opportunity, with a handful of high level car talks from people who have worked for the major car companies, or those working for aftermarket startups. This existed, but I was pleasantly surprised to see so much "out of the box" conversation as well.</p>
<p>Seeing that the conversation wasn't just focused on automobiles, but also the wider world of transportation at <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">API Days San Francisco,</a> made me very hopeful for the future of APIs, and how they will be applied within the automobile industry.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/ifthisthenthat/IFTTT-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>One interesting theme I heard at <a href="http://sf.apidays.io/">API Days San Francisco</a>&nbsp;last week, was the concept of API reciprocity, or <a href="https://ifttt.com/">If This Then That</a>(IFTTT) moving into more niche areas. This edition of API Days was focused on "Disrupting the Car Industry and Driver Experience with APIs&rdquo;, and I heard several times, people saying, &ldquo;Its If This Then That for cars&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After If This Then That put an iconographic face on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/28/from-etl-to-api-reciprocity-looking-at-20-service-providers/">classic practice of Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)</a>, and focused on not traditional database and IT system, but API driven software as a service (SaaS), I saw over <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">30 other providers</a> follow in their footsteps. It is my mission to understand how these companies are evolving the ETL world, and write about it across the API Evangelist network.</p>
<p>In 2014, I think the concept has reached a maturity point, where reciprocity and interoperability between API driven platforms is being applied to niche areas. With the popularity of IFTTT and Zapier, in helping tech savvy users understand how they can take control over how data and content flow in our increasingly digital worlds, it makes total sense that startups would look to apply this successful pattern to niche areas like the automobile experience.</p>
<p>While Zapier, IFTTT and many other reciprocity providers are providing general purpose recipes for keeping your online world in sync, there is a growing number of focused providers, like <a href="http://www.sortmybox.com/">SortMyInbox</a> for email, <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet Labs</a> for cloud computing, and <a href="http://roadrules.co/">RoadRules.io</a> which was present at API Days in San Francisco.</p>
<p>I think this new breed of API focused ETL startups, delivering niche recipes of automation, interoperability and reciprocity in our digital worlds, will continue to expand. You will hear more startup pitches, where the founder says, &ldquo;Its like If This Then That for X&rdquo;.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/dropcam/dropcam.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of the mutiple requests to review APIs currently in my inbox, is from the camera platform <a href="https://www.dropcam.com">Dropcam</a>. Every email or tweet I get, asking me to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/12/12/an-api-evangelist-review-of-your-api/">review an API</a>, I at least click in to see what is happening, looking for that good story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes the API itself, can be good enough to be the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; that I tell a story about, but most often it is about a specific approach the API provider takes. Regardless, I look throughr all aspects of an API, sign up for an account, play with endpoints, look through documentation and code, and terms of service&mdash;trying to find any angle for a compelling story.</p>
<p>When I clicked into <a href="https://www.dropcam.com/developers">Dropcam's developer area</a>, I can&rsquo;t sign up for the API, play with endpoints, review documentation and code, but I can look at terms of service! Dropcam asks that you apply to be part of their beta program, before you can look at or play with anything.</p>
<p>Dropcam assures me that their API is RESTful and uses its verbs, with all endpoints using HTTPS, and requests and responses in JSON. Dropcam uses oAuth for authentication and authorization, showing that all the proper technology and security building blocks are in place--thing is I need to see for myself.</p>
<p>I can understand putting an approval layer at the point someone wants to take their application public, but if someone owns a Dropcam, they should be able to signup and start hacking on their device and the supporting cloud infrastructure. With modern API management infrastructure you have the power to control what resources developers have access to, with identify the bad actors, without limiting who has access to learn about your platform.</p>
<p>Most importantly it prevents people like me from just reviewing the endpoints, documentation and the real meat of the Dropcam developer program. I&rsquo;m not building an application, I just want to write a story about what is possible, and without playing with it I can&rsquo;t do that. I&rsquo;m not like many other tech journalists who will take a press release and rewrite it&mdash;I want to play!!</p>
<p>So far, that is my review Dropcam. Sorry. ;-(</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-craft/san-francisco/api-craft-sf-june-2014.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I participated in an <a href="http://www.meetup.com/API-Craft-San-Francisco/events/185583452/">API Craft meetup this last Thursday</a>, hosted by 3Scale in San Francisco. The gathering included Uri Sarid(<a href="https://twitter.com/usarid">@usarid</a>)&nbsp;representing <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>, Jakub Nesetril(<a href="https://twitter.com/jakubnesetril">@jakubnesetril</a>)&nbsp;on behalf of <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, Tony Tam(<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>) with his <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a>, and myself, discussing the fast growing world of API design.</p>
<p>While there are other formats for defining APIs, API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger represent the leading API definition formats, tools, and services in the space right now. I assumed we'd be talking about each of the API definition formats, but the conversation was more about how we got here, and the motivations behind generating API descriptions.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/05/what-are-the-incentives-for-creating-machine-readable-api-definitions/">numerous reasons why API providers would want to generate API designs</a>, ranging from the ability to mock interfaces, to generating interactive documentation that helps onboard API consumers. Having this conversation is important, as not all API providers are generating API definitions, and many of those who do, do not understand all the benefits of have machine readable API definitions.</p>
<p>Thank you to Emmanuel Paraskakis(<a href="https://twitter.com/manp">@manp</a>)&nbsp;who organized the meet up, <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> for hosting and sponsoring the conversation, the beer (which included Stone IPA w00t!), and making it possible so the leaders in the space can discuss the increasingly relevant topic of API design, and share the insight with the San Francisco API audience.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/06/15/netflix-finally-shutters-support-for-public-api/">Netflix Finally Shutters Support For Public API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">15 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/netflix/netflix-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Netflix officially announced they will be ending support for their public API. Its no surprise, as they <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/03/12/netflix-api-is-much-more-than-a-public-api/">announced early in 2013 that they would longer accept new registrations for the API</a>.</p>
<p>While I think that Netflix could have put more resources into their API, and fought harder to make their public API a success, I still consider Netflix to be one of API pioneers that we can learn from when crafting our own API strategy.</p>
<p>While the public Netflix API was not a success, the internal and partner API strategy at Netflix was a success. APIs have allowed the company to scale into the cloud, grow internationally, and expand to sever over 1000 devices via their trusted partner network.</p>
<p>In addition to the internal API success at Netflix, they have been amazing at sharing their knowledge and experience with the wider API community via their blog, conferences like <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>, and in books like <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021223.do">APIs: A Strategy Guide</a>, available on O'Reilly Publishing, written by Daniel Jacobsen, Greg Brail and Dan Woods.</p>
<p>Another positive byproduct of Netflix API operation, is that the company has been prolific in open sourcing the technology that goes into the API stack. When you visit the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix">Netflix Github account</a>, you will find a wealth of open tooling that they have worked hard on, and opened up for public use.</p>
<p>API success varies widely from company to company, sector to sector, and it doesn't always look like you think it will&mdash;this is part of the API experience. Just because Netflix doesn't reflect one vision of API success that open developers believed in, it doesn't mean Netflix as a whole was an API failure. There are plenty of lessons to learn from their public API failure, as well as their internal API success.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2014</span>

<p>I&rsquo;m still extracting great examples of API design, deployment, and management, that other API providers can follow, from recent API projects out of our federal government, with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/08/18f-shows-what-is-possible-in-government-with-fbopen-api/">FBOpen</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">OpenFDA out of the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA).</a></p>
<p>This particular post is about the approach to establishing a feedback loop with consumers of the OpenFDA API. If you visit the<a href="https://open.fda.gov/"> OpenFDA portal,</a>&nbsp;you will find that API consumers can seek help via three self-service channels:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://github.com/FDA">GitHub</a></li>
<li><a href="http://opendata.stackexchange.com/search?q=openFDA">StackExchange</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23openfda">Twitter</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t get your question answered by searching through existing Github, StackExchange, and Twitter conversations, you have three ways to directly ask the OpenFDA team questions:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/ask?tags=openFDA">StackExchange</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/FDA">GitHub</a></li>
<li>Email</li>
</ul>
<p>What is notable (thanks Gray Brooks), is that OpenFDA uses existing services to establish the feedback loop with API consumers&mdash;meaning they use Github, StackExchange, and Twitter rather than rolling their own tool. OpenFDA understands that there are existing conversation that are already occurring on StackExchange, and developers are used to going here to find the answers they need.</p>
<p>Additionally by stimulating the conversation on StackExchange and Twitter you are generating valuable social media and SEO exhaust that will help new consumers, potentially learn about the OpenFDA API, and how it is being used by developers.  This type of feedback loop doesn&rsquo;t just provide support for community, it establishes itself as the heartbeat of your API, showing that someone is home, and is there to support and listen.</p>
<p>The best part is that using Twitter, StackExchange, and Github are free for public conversations, and take almost no time to setup. OpenFDA directly links to the form for asking a question on StackExchange, they don&rsquo;t for Github, but easily could. They also directly link to #OpenFDA hashtag to join existing conversations on StackExchange and Twitter, which is a pretty slick way to weave external searches into your API feedback loop.</p>
<p>Lots of good patterns to follow, from the leading groups deploying APIs in the US federal government.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/06/09/the-edx-api/">The edX API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">09 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.edx.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/edx/edx-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This post should tell you about how behind I am in my storytelling&mdash;this story is from an <a href="/admin/blog/google">event I attended in Arlington TX</a>, on April 30th, and May 1st. While in Arlington, I spoke to a group of professionals who were crafting an online data &amp; analytics course. A couple of the participants were from edX, the online course platform partnership between MIT, Harvard, UC Berkeley and other universities.</p>
<p>Over the course of two days, I had a cance ask the question, where was the edX API? Seemed like an obvious question, to which <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/watsonemily">Emily Watson</a>, the program manager at edX, responded, &ldquo;Its on our roadmap&rdquo;!  An answer I get from many online companies, but Emily pulled up their roadmap on the wiki, and <a href="https://edx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OPENPROD/Open+edX+Public+Product+Roadmap">indeed it was on their roadmap</a>.</p>
<p>I told Emily, I&rsquo;d review the edX platform, and provide some feedback, that they could incorporate into their strategy. This one is easy, and is my basic feedback for any company with an online website and/or application&mdash;you make everything currently available on your site or application, available via an API. A quick glance at edX, these would be:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Courses</strong> - The 175+ courses available on edX, should also be available in a machine readable format, via the edX API.</li>
<li><strong>Faculty &amp; Staff </strong>- The 400+ faculty and staff involved in producing edX courses should be available in a machine readable format, via the edX API.</li>
<li><strong>Schools &amp; Partners</strong>- All edX partners should be available in a machine readable format, via the edX API.</li>
</ul>
<p>You start with the low hanging fruit, by establishing three, simply designed web APIs for those already, publicly available resources, then move on to providing the essential business building blocks for any API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Dedicated API Portal -</strong> Simple, dedicated portal for edX API integrations, that isn&rsquo;t just for developers. It should be easy enough for anyone to learn about the edX API, without too much technical detail front and center.</li>
<li><strong>Simple Landing Page -</strong> The home page of the edX API portal should be dead simple, explaining what the API does, providing easy one click access to get to whatever any API, or potential API consumer will need.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Registration </strong>- The edX API needs to be accessible 24/7, and developers should be able to register without approval, and at least get minimum access to the system to begin playing with resources, even if it takes approval to get higher levels of access. Modern <a href="https://bitly.com/13esk6Q+">API management solutions like 3Scale</a> work very well in managing this layer of access, and service composition.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive Documentation </strong>- The standard for all APIs in 2014 is to provide interactive documentation, making learning about an API, a hands on experience. There are some common approaches to defining an API using machine readable formats like <a href="http://bit.ly/1w9oKpq">Swagger</a>, which will automatically generate interactive documentation for consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Code Samples &amp; Libraries -</strong> Developers need all the help they can in getting up and running with an API, and right after interactive API documentation, code libraries and samples are critical to onboarding API consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Blog W/ RSS </strong>- An active blog, with RSS for syndication provides the necessary stories and resulting SEO that helps communicate the value an API offers, and keeps new and existing consumers in tune with API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter Presence - </strong>An active Twitter presence is common place for leading API platforms, and edX will need an active Twitter account to support its other communications, and support operations.</li>
<li><strong>Support Ticket System </strong>- An easy to use, trackable support system for the edX API platform will be essential to establishing a feedback loop with API consumers. Github issue management works very well, for an out of the box, API support ticket system for all public APis.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion Forum -</strong> Discussion forums are common place in APIs, and provide potential indirect, community support, that can help new and existing API consumers find what they are looking for. Don&rsquo;t limit yourself to a local discussion forum, there are SaaS solutions, as well as existing developer driven communities like Stack Overflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next make sure and cover the basic political building blocks:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Terms of Service -</strong> Provide simple, liberal terms of service that incentivize integrations and development.</li>
<li><strong>Content Licensing -</strong> Make sure all licensing for any content is explained front and center.</li>
<li><strong>Code Licensing -</strong> Clearly license all client side code samples, libraries and event potentially server side code for the API.</li>
<li><strong>API Licensing -</strong> Make sure the API definition is openly licensed, so that it can be re-used, re-mixed in many ways--consider putting into <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Branding Requirements -</strong> Provide clear direction when it comes to branding requirements around API integrations.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limits -</strong> Help developers understand what rate limits are in place to keep system stable, and what ways there are to get more access.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing -</strong> Are there any costs for API access? If there are, make sure and clearly explain what is free, and at what points do resources cost.</li>
<li><strong>Partner Tiers -</strong> Establish multiple layers of API access, allowing trusted partners to achieve higher rate limits, and write access to resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>That should do it! ;-) As you can see the APIs themselves are just the starting point. It is too late for edX to be API-first, which would have been much easier, but you have just get your basic APIs, the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">supporting business and political building blocks</a>, and get down to the hard work of evangelizing, managing, and iterating on the edX API. The learning doesn't start until you have the API up, being consumed, and have engage users who are providing feedback for the roadmap.</p>
<p>Once a basic edX API is up and running, and edX has some experience under their belt in managing the API community, then some thought can be put into creating a read / write API, allowing access to student information via oAuth, as well as letting trusted partners publish content, and student data into the system.  A read / write system could be done in a single release, but since edX is a little behind curve on getting API up, I recommend cutting teeth on a read only system for version 1.0.</p>
<p>In reality, this advice for designing, deploying, managing, and evangelizing an API applies to any company with an online presence. It is a pretty proven formula extracted from watching multiple API leaders like Twitter, Google and Amazon. In this particular scenario, edX needs to get on the ball--it is difficult for me to imagine being an online education platform that operates between multiple universities in 2014, and not having an active API. ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/open-fda-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>My friends over at Social Health Insights, <a href="http://socialhealthinsights.com/2014/06/openfda-api-launch-success/">wrote about their experience being one of the beta users for the new OpenFDA API</a>, and what they thought contributed to the success of the API launch from the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>What I found interesting about their post, is that contributing factors were not technical:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Getting Feedback Early -</strong> The openFDA team solicited feedback early on in the API development process from end users and consumers of the API. This feedback was listened to and ultimately helped shape a very nice API at launch.</li>
<li><strong>Being Collaborative - </strong>If you are going to do #1 then you must be willing to be collaborative. From the get-go, the openFDA team collaborated with a number of stakeholders and was open all the feedback that streamed in. This ultimately resulted in a great product at release. Beyond the initial collaboration they are still listening and we bet they will be open to the feedback that comes in.</li>
<li><strong>Being Responsive -</strong> Send a tweet or message to the team and see what you get. You will be shocked at how fast they get back with you to answer your question. We saw questions over Twitter being answered by the community and openFDA team members within minutes (pretty cool)!</li>
<li><strong>Explaining Use Cases Well -</strong> Go to the openFDA website and you will see several queries tied to real wold questions about the data exposed by the new adverse event API. This helps consumers understand the possibilities and content of the API quicker and simpler. Beyond this, they solicited private beta testers to build solutions on top of the API which also provided additional sample use cases of solutions that could be created using the API.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am present on the backchannel for the OpenFDA rollout, so I saw some of the back and forth on the technical aspects of OpenFDA, and there was definitely lots of tech talk, but ultimately the success depended on providing use cases, getting early feedback, while also being collaborative and responsive.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said a thousand times before, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how technically perfect your API is, without the business and politics of your API dialed in, you will fumble the ball. Always keep in mind, that the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">reasons why this whole API thing is working</a>, goes well beyond just the technology.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://twitter.com/gluecon">#Gluecon</a> in Colorado the other week, I have API design on the brain. A portion of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/23/keeping-the-api-conversation-moving-forward-at-the-gluecon-apistrat-unworkshops/">#APIStrat un-workshops were dedicated to API design related discussion</a>, and <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API Design</a> is also the most trafficked portion of API Evangelist this year, according to my Google Analytics.</p>
<p>At #Gluecon, 3Scale and API Evangelist announced our new <a href="http://apisjson.org">API discovery project APIs.json</a>, and associated tooling, <a href="http://apis.io">API search engine APIs.io</a>. For APIs.json, APIs.io, and API Commons to work, we are counting API providers, and API consumers creating machine readable API definitions.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I wanted to do some exploration--what would be possible incentives for creating machine readable API definitions?</p>

<p>The importance of having an API definition of available resources, is increasing. It was hard to realize the value of defining APIs with the heavy, top down defined WSDL, and even its web counterpart WADL, but with these new approaches, other incentives are emerging&mdash;incentives that live throughout the API lifecycle.</p>
<p>The first tangible shift in this area was when Swagger released the Swagger UI, providing interactive documentation that was generated from a Swagger API definition. Apiary quickly moved the incentives to an earlier stage in the API design lifecycle with design, mocking and collaboration opportunities.</p>
<p>As the API design world continues to explode, I&rsquo;m seeing a number of other incentives emerge for API providers to generate machine readable API definitions, and looking to find any incentives that I&rsquo;m missing, as well as identify any opportunities in how I can encourage API designers to generate machine readable API definitions in whatever format they desire.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://editor.swagger.wordnik.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-editor.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In January I started taking a closer look at the world of API design, by reviewing the top movers in the space, <a href="http://bit.ly/1kFrKF0">Swagger</a> from <a href="http://bit.ly/1kFrINy">Wordnik</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1cl8tCc">API Blueprint</a> from <a href="http://bit.ly/1pb4H8k">Apiary</a>, and <a href="http://bit.ly/16ZTZYt">RAML</a> from <a href="http://bit.ly/1mtmiF9">Mulesoft</a>. My goal was to quantity the world of API design, and help me understand where it might be going, or where there are opportunities for new tools and services.</p>
<p>My intention is to write a white paper on API Design, but haven&rsquo;t reached this point, with the crazy amount of events and travel I&rsquo;ve had in the last couple months. Looking back, at where I left off in my research, the major difference between providers was that Swagger was JSON, and didn't have all the tooling that was available with API Blueprint and RAML.</p>
<p>Fast forward 60 days, and I find myself at Gluecon, hanging out with Tony Tam of Reverb, creator of Swagger. On the last day of the conference,Tony shows me the new Swagger editor, with a new focus on YAML, as well as JSON Swagger definitions.  With one release Tony addresses any gap in the space, leveling the API design playing field between API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML.</p>
<p>While there are many differences between each providers, which you can see in my reposting of  <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/api-definitions-how-do-they-model-rest/">Ole Lensmar of SmartBear explored in his talk at #APIStrat Amsterdam with how they model REST</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/03/api-definitions-what-is-behind-the-name">what is behind the name</a>, each of these top API design solutions will get you there, it just depends on your preferences.</p>
<p>60 days ago I would say that RAML and API Blueprint had a leg up on Swagger because of markdown / YAML focus, and with the amount of tooling they had. With one release Swagger has closed the gap, and with the traction they have amongst developers with a first mover advantage, this could put them squarely in the lead for adoption.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m predicting I&rsquo;ll have more time this month to finish up my API design research, and produce the first draft of the white paper. API design is proving to one of the most talked about areas of the API sector in 2014, and one I&rsquo;m enjoying tracking on.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Jun 2014</span>

<p>I&rsquo;m still playing catch up on many of my stories from over the last month, and one of them is the ability to publish your API definition straight from your API deployment using <a href="https://apispark.com/">APISpark</a>. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with APISpark, it is a cloud-based API deployment service built on the <a href="http://restlet.com/">open source RESTlet framework</a>.</p>
<p>Using APISpark you can deploy APIs from existing Google Spreadsheets, machine readable files on Amazon S3, or directly from a fresh datastore. APISpark gives you all the control you need over generating your endpoints, securing and monitoring the resulting APIs&mdash;all without any programming or back-end infrastructure.</p>
<p>For me, the best part is that once you have your API deployed with APISpark, it automatically generates an <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> manifest, and serves up the URL you need to publish into the commons.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/api-spark/apispark-api-commons.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>It means a lot that APISpark understands the importance of publishing your APis to the commons, allow users to publicly showcase their API designs, acknowledging that API definitions should be interoperable, and licensed for re-use. Thanks for baking this feature directly into your API platform, and ensuring all your users play healthy role in the API economy.</p>

<p>There are numerous reasons for API designers to follow hypermedia patterns when crafting their internal, partner or publicly available APIs. One of the most fundamental reasons for offering hypermedia is to help developers understand what to do next, once receiving a response from your API.</p>
<p>Hypermedia APIs mimic the default characteristics of the web, and how you always know what do next with a web page, because there are many available links either in the form of navigation, in the body or footer. Reflecting this behavior, each hypermedia API resources comes with a set of related links giving developers clear actions to take once the response is received.</p>
<p>It can be easy to get lost in the numerous hypermedia debates online, not quite understanding all of the benefits of this fast growing API design pattern, but one clear reason is to help developers understand what to do next. Without clear instructions, developers can make obvious mistakes, misuse or misrepresent API resources, and be out of alignment with your own business goals in providing the API resource in the first place.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://heroku.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/heroku/heroku-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am playing around with deploying APIs using multiple cloud platforms, and using popular container solutions. Next up is quickly deploying one of my utility APIs, to <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>, complete with access control, traffic reports, and supporting analytics with <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale infrastructure</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Application - Simple Screen Capture API</strong><br /> I&rsquo;ve been working through an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/an-operational-harness-for-my-screen-capture-api/">operational harness</a> for deploying all my APIs, and the API I use to push forward my approach to API deployment, is a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/creating-my-own-screenshot-api/">screen capture API</a>. This is what I will be deploying on Heroku, creating a simple application, that will take screen captures of web pages that I pass to it.</p>
<p><strong>3Scale Heroku Add-On</strong><br /> To make API deployment on Heroku easier, <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/threescale">3Scale has created a Heroku add-on</a> that you can easily deploy for any application you have running on the PaaS platform. With just a single click I added the 3Scale Heroku add-on to my screen capture API--now I can apply 3Scale API infrastructure to my API.</p>
<p><strong>API Access Control</strong><br /> Using 3Scale I can control who has access to my screen capture API, by setting rate limits and quotas, and if I want I can even charge for access. I can compose any type of service levels for my API that I want. I will create tiers for internal access, external partners, and a public tier where I charge a fee for each API call.</p>
<p><strong>API Traffic Report and Analytics</strong><br /> With all of my screen capture API traffic managed with 3Scale, I can now see traffic analytics and reports, broken down any account, application or for specific service. Any developer who signs up for my screen capture API, will get access to the reports for their account usage as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://addons.heroku.com/threescale"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3Scale/3scale-heroku-add-on.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Ready-To-Go Developer Portal</strong><br /> One of the benefits of using 3Scale for deploying your API on Heroku, is that you get a developer portal to go with your APIs. This is where developers will to learn about your API, register for API keys, and view reports on their usage.</p>
<p><strong>Free To Get Started</strong><br /> One of the main reasons I use 3Scale to mange my APIs, is that even though I&rsquo;m on the paid tier now, 3Scale allows me to fire up new APIs, manage access and receive reports at no charge.  I don&rsquo;t pay until my APIs start generating traffic, and if my business model is sound, I should be covered. You get up to 250 user accounts with a traffic volume 150,000 API calls per day before you have to move up to the next tier.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-lingual APIs In Cloud</strong><br /> 3Scale provides <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/threescale#deployment-overview">instructions for deploying APIs using Ruby, Node.js, and Java</a>, allowing you to the language you prefer for API deployment.</p>
<p><strong>Drive API Code From Github</strong><br /> I will be driving the development of the code for my screen capture API using Github. Heroku allows me connect my application to a specific Github repository, allowing me to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/05/github-as-the-central-presence-definition-configuration-and-source-code-for-your-api/">manage all my API deployment centrally using Github</a>.</p>
<p>I already have a PHP version of my screen capture API, that uses the Slim REST framework, which wraps around PhantomJS, which does the actual screen capture. Now I can take my standard utility grade, screen capture API and easily deploy on Heroku, for my own internal use, for a partner, or to any wholesale customer who would like to deploy a screen capture API in their own Heroku account.</p>
<p>Next I&rsquo;m going to look at various ways to deploy the same screen capture API using Amazon Web Services (AWS). There are several options for deploying APIs on AWS, and hopefully I can find the easiest, lowest cost way to get an API deployed, by playing with several approaches.</p>

<p>I started beta testing a new JavaScript library, combined with API, that I&rsquo;m calling linkrot.js. My goal is to address link rot across my blogs. There are two main reasons links are bad on my site, either I moved the page or resource, or a website or other resource has gone away.</p>
<p>To help address this problem, I wrote a simple JavaScript file that lives in the footer of my blog, and when the page loads, it spiders all the links on the page, combining them into a single list and then makes a call to the linkrot.js API.</p>
<p>All new links will get a URL shortener applied, as well as a screenshot taken of the page. Every night a script will run to check the HTTP status of each link used in my site&mdash;verifying the page exists, and is a valid link.</p>
<p>Every time link rot.js loads, it will spider the links available in the page, sync with linkrot.js API, and the API returns the corresponding shortened URL, or if a link shows a 404 status, the link will no longer link to page, it will popup the last screenshot of the page, identifying the page no longer exists.</p>
<p>Eventually I will be developing a dashboard, allowing me to manage the link rot across my websites, make suggestions on links I can fix, provides a visual screen capture of those I cannot, while also adding a new analytics layer by implementing shortened URLs.</p>
<p>Linkrot.js is just an internal tool I&rsquo;m developing in private beta. Once I get up and running, Audrey will beta test, and we&rsquo;ll see where it goes from there. Who knows!</p>

<p>Even with the risk of possible creating some sort of API wormhole, I just added the <a href="http://apicommons.org/apis.html">API Commons API to the API Commons</a>. The API for adding and searching for APIs that are in the commons, now has an <a href="http://apicommons.org/api-commons-manifest.json">API definition</a> that is publicly declared as part of the commons, with a CC-BY license.</p>
<p>It just makes sense to have the API for the commons in the commons, so anyone can establish their own commons, complete with common API. 3Scale and API Evangelist are taking a particular stance on the API copyright discussion, and if our approach doesn&rsquo;t match your vision of the API economy, we encourage you to fork and establish your own commons.</p>
<p>We only launched the API Commons API two months ago, so the definition is still fairly new, and we would love to hear your thoughts on the API definition, and the underlying format of the API Commons Manifest. It is up to all of us to help keep the surface area of the API economy as open, accessible, reusable and interoperable as possible.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/romainhuet/twitter-apis-connecting-to-the-pulse-of-the-planet"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/twitter/romain-huet-twitter-slide-twitter-pulse-of-planet.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of watching Romain Huet (<a href="https://twitter.com/romainhuet">@romainhuet</a>), developer evangelist at Twitter, give his very entertaining talk three times now, and if you haven&rsquo;t seen it, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkKEZMjFLSQ">looking it up on the APIStrat Youtube channel</a>. Romain walks us through the world of Twitter, showing us the power of the platform and its API, but the really entertaining part is the two Internet of things (Iot) demos that he executes during his talk.</p>
<p>The first demo Romain does, is taking an audience selfie using a Raspberry Pi driven camera, triggered by a Tweet. The second demo involves flying a quadcopter drone on stage, that uses <a href="http://nodecopter.com/">NodeCopter</a>&nbsp;as the&nbsp;interface, and Twitter as the communication layer. Both demos are crowd pleasers, which makes for not just an entertaining talk, but shows the potential of Iot + APIs, while also making the audience part of the experience.</p>
<p>I think the demos that Romain delivers are important, because they offer a unique learnng gateway to both Iot and APIs. While Twitter as a communication layer for the Internet of things may not be a scalable, production ready solution for talking to devices, I think it is a great learning platform for individuals to learn not just about APIs, but how APIs can be used to communicate with the devices in their world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkKEZMjFLSQ"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/romain-apistrat-ams.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Simple Communication</strong><br /> Twitter is a simple communication platform, which posseses a social graph that is easy to understand by people who are new to the world of APIs. When individuals are  experimenting with both APIs and Iot, Twitter provides a great 101 level sandbox to learn from fun, simple, meaningful IoT + API tutorials.</p>
<p><strong>Simple API</strong><br /> The Twitter API is very mature, providing a simple, yet robust communication API to jumpstart their education. The overhead to get up and running on Twitter API by new users is very low, and with simple tutorials based upon demos like Romain&rsquo;s selfie photo, and drone, the platform provides a great sandbox for experiencing these IoT + API interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Public And Social By Default</strong><br /> Twitter is a public communication channel. Sure you can use DM&rsquo;s between users, but Twitter is open and social by default, and excellent introduction to the importance of security and privacy in the world of Iot. Users will immediately be faced with questions of messages being public, who will see, and how your devices will have to communicate in this open environment.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter As Stepping Stone</strong><br /> When it comes to Iot communication, Twitter is not a scalable solution, however it is an excellent stepping stone. Not all users who engage with Iot + API tutorials will need to scale their implementation. This approach to learning about IoT and APIs is just be a stepping stone, giving new users an API 101 introductory course on how devices like Raspberry Pi, Nodecopter and other IoT devices operate&mdash;where they go next is up to them.</p>

<p>As part of the API 101 work I&rsquo;m doing with 3Scale, I will be exploring other API 101 tutorials for consumers, hoping to provide easy to follow resources that can help anyone understand how APIs work. Not all the examples will be Iot related like Romain&rsquo;s--I will be working on examples in multiple categories, based upon conversations I&rsquo;ve had with other API teachers from across the space.</p>

        <p><a href="http://tosdr.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/terms-of-service-didnt-read/tos-didnt-read-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been following the work of <a href="http://tosdr.org/">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read</a> for some time now. In my opinion this work is some of the most important legal work out there right now, which is guiding all of our activity not just online, but increasingly in our offline worlds. If you aren't familiar with Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read, I think their slogan sums it up well:</p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;I have read and agree to the Terms&rdquo; is the biggest lie on the web. We aim to fix that.</em></blockquote>
<p>More clarity and balance in the terms of service that online services employ is critical to the future of society and the web, this single checkbox is deciding our fate, whether you realize it or not. One of the projects I&rsquo;m working on in coming months, is forking and extending the Terms of Service Didn't Read work into the world of APIs.</p>
<p>While I was aware that the Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read work is openly licensed, I wasn't aware of the degree of openness, until I started digging through their <a href="https://github.com/tosdr/">Github account</a> and found <a href="https://github.com/tosdr/tosdr.org/tree/master/topics">machine readable inventory of the questions they ask of TOS</a>. This is huge!</p>
<p>To achieve their rating of each online service, TOS Didn't Read asks questions of each service providers TOS. This list of questions is critical to making sense of the complex legalese that TOS contain, allowing for them to derive a rating for each service, and provide a list of plain english description of what you face when signing up for each online service.</p>
<p>In coming months, I will be working on a forked version of TOS Didn't Read, applying their machine readable questions specifically to APIs, and hopefully contributing cycles to the central TOS Didn&rsquo;t Read. My intention is to make machine readable API definitions for this critical building block of the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-surveillance-camera.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an advisor to the camera API platform, <a href="https://www.evercam.io/">EverCam</a>. I don&rsquo;t advise the startup because I&rsquo;m super excited about the opportunities for APIs for security cameras. I'm involved because I believe in the Evercam team, and I want to be aware of this fast growing aspect of the Internet of things and API economy. Security cameras are not going away, and I want to help lend some critical thought to how we use security cameras, and apply APIs to help introduce transparency and accountability into this easily abused layer of our society.</p>
<p>One of the things I learned from Evercam, is that <a href="https://www.gov.uk/request-cctv-footage-of-yourself">in the UK you can request any photos of you taken on the vast closed circuit television</a>, that is ubiquitous across the UK landscape. You can submit a request for a time, day and location and request any photo or video footage taken of you. Its kind of like a visual FOIA request for the surveillance layer of our society. This concept intrigued me, and I wanted to explore in relationship to other layers of convergence between the API economy and our increasingly digital society.</p>
<p>Imagine if there was FOIA process for data. I could submit a request to a single organization that would then make requests to leading technology, and big data companies, asking them for a copy of all data they possess about me, and disclose any partners that they have shared this data with. I know portions of this exist from companies like <a href="http://www.acxiom.com/">Acxiom</a>, but I would like to see a more coherent, intra-company solution that could better serve individuals who wish to understand how companies are using their data.</p>
<p>A concept like FOIA for data across any company will not please corporate america, especially in a landscape where exploitation of users data is the predominant business model. However we are in the early years of the Internet, and things are very much the wild wild west, and it is only a matter of time before government regulations are needed to ensure the privacy of all citizens, and reduce exploitation and abuse by the bad apples.</p>
<p>This concept isn't far fetched. With modern, API driven systems, it is easy to track all of a users data, and where and how it is used across a company&rsquo;s network. If all data access is required to occur via APIs, it will be easy to pull a history of which users were accessed, by which internal or external consumers. Each company could be required to have an API allowing a 3rd party auditor to pull data on behalf of users, allowing independent organizations to make FOIA style data requests across multiple companies on behalf of users.</p>
<p>I know that business owners will cry foul at such an idea, claiming it is just more unnecessary regulation that they will have to deal with, but we need a way of making all this more accountable. The API driven systems that would make this possible would also give companies all the other benefits APIs afford, in making company assets more accessible. APIs would allow companies to rapidly deploy web and mobile applications, while also providing assurances to every citizen that their privacy was being respected, and all of our vital personal information was not being exploited.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2014</span>

<p>I've been tracking on the <a href="http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-135.html">API from the US Census Bureau since they launched in 2012</a>, and even <a href="https://plus.google.com/+KinLane/posts/4suNfHBWfUE">met with them to discuss their strategy</a> over the last couple years. The team at the Census Bureau has slowly integrated an external API into their operations, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/19/providing-full-data-download-vs-api/">opening up conversations around census survey data</a>, that is harder to achieve from just downloads only.</p>
<p>I recently saw a <a href="http://www.commerce.gov/blog/2014/06/03/research-2020-census-continues-%E2%80%93-census-bureau-opens-temporary-office">post that Census Bureau is gearing up for the 2020 census</a>. As I was reading the post, I couldn't help but think about how the Census API will influence how the 2020 census is executed. Additionally I wonder if any other APIs will be used during the census process, such as Twitter or other social platforms.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the census, and its resulting data will continue to be a cornerstone of the API and open data space. Census data adds a lot of value to other websites, mobile apps, and data visualizations and analysis, and is critical in providing context for both our online and offline worlds. I will continue to keep an eye on the <a href="http://www.census.gov/developers/">US Census API</a>, and look for signs of how APIs are influencing the 2020 census.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">Another Strong API Implementation In Federal Government With OpenFDA</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/open-fda-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am really impressed with the quality of API deployments coming out of the federal government recently. I wrote about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/08/18f-shows-what-is-possible-in-government-with-fbopen-api/">FBOpen API from 18F</a> a couple months ago, and the latest is the <a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html">OpenFDA API from the Food &amp; Drug Administration</a>. I&rsquo;ve been watching the rollout of the API from behind the scenes for a while now, but with all my travel and speaking I haven't had time to write about or participate, but now that they've officially launch publicly, I wanted to help showcase what they've been up to at the FDA.</p>
<p><strong>Meaningful First Impression</strong><br /> When you first land on OpenFDA, you immediately understand what it does, thanks to the interactive visual on the homepage introducing OpenFDA, letting you know that it contains more than 3 million adverse drug event reports, with frequently reported indications for drug use among women, 55 to 90. This simple simple description, combined with an interactive visual that demonstrates the value contained within this government API resource, leaves a meaningful first impression upon arrival.</p>
<p><strong>Not Just Talk Of Being Open</strong><br /> We&rsquo;ve misused the word open when it comes to APIs, so that I&rsquo;m always skeptical when I see it use, but not in the case of OpenFDA. At the top of the home page, it gives three distinct examples of how OpenFDA embraces open, with data, code, and in community, and through making the API openly accessible, simply by requesting a key, in exchange for your email address.</p>
<p><strong>Explaining What It Is All About</strong><br /> OpenFDA explains what the OpenFDA is all about with a detailed about page, telling what the API does, who worked on the project, and how you can get involved. This type of background is often overlooked by API providers, requiring API consumers to have to piece together what the big picture is around an API&mdash;not with OpenFDA. On-boarding with the API starts with an overview of the project, and resulting API, then dropping you into what is needed to get signed up and begin using the API.</p>
<p><strong>Key Based Authentication</strong><br /> All that is required to get up and running using the OpenFDA API, is a valid email address, which in return you get an API key that you can use to make all API calls. Of course there are terms of service (TOS) and rate limit restrictions on each key, but this is standard operating procedure for APIs, especially one still in beta.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/elasticsearch/elastic-search-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Deployed Using ElasticSearch</strong><br /> Where the FBOpen from 18F used <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr to deploy their API</a>, OpenFDA uses <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">search and analytics platform ElasticSearch</a> to deploy their API. I think both of these approaches reflect an interesting trend in government, which deploys APIs from existing, an sometimes messy data stores, allowing a more meaningful and useful layer to be added with very little effort.</p>
<p><strong>Powerful Search Capabilities</strong><br /> One of the benefit of using existing search solutions like ElasticSearch, is that you get some pretty sophisticated search tools, with very little work. OpenFDA starts with providing the basic query parameters for search, then also adds in query syntax, exact matches, grouping, dates, and ranges&mdash;providing very powerful search capabilities out of the box.</p>
<p><strong>Necessary Terminology To Get Started</strong><br /> When using the OpenFDA API, you are accessing drug events, which will require some necessary terminology to get up to speed on the world of pharmaceuticals, unless of course this is the world you already live in. OpenFDA provides the necessary, to get anyone up to speed on the terminology needed to understand what is contained the 3 million drug event reports.</p>
<p><strong>Interactive API Documentation With Visuals</strong><br /> Interactive API documentation, allowing API consumers to make live API calls while learning about an API, is fast becoming essential for any API. OpenFDA provides interactive documentation, making learning about the OpenFDA API a hands-on experience, but takes this ones step further by providing supporting data visualizations. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of interactive API documentation, and I don&rsquo;t believe I've ever seen real-time visualizations to go with documentation&mdash;something I will explore further in a separate story.</p>
<p><strong>Essential  Communication Channels</strong><br /> OpenFDA doesn't miss a beat in establishing the required communication channels for the API, providing updates on the platform in a blog format, available directly from the home page. Additionally OpenFDA employs Twitter, providing a real-time conversation around the valuable API resource, between the FDA and 3rd party consumers. Open, active communication channels, providing two-way communication between a platform and its consumers, is one of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/06/remembering-why-this-whole-api-thing-is-working--apidays-berlin/">essential ingredients that make this whole API thing work</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://open.fda.gov/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/fda/introducing-open-fda.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Essential Support Framework</strong><br /> Building on top of OpenFDA platform updates, and Twitter communication channels, OpenFDA provides a multi-tiered support framework, allowing API consumers to ask questions on StackExchange, report bugs via Github, and send feedback via email. The OpenFDA support framework plus the open communication channels, establishes a robust feedback loop for the FDA around drug event report data.</p>
<p><strong>Active Github Presence</strong><br /> Github is an essential building block for all government APIs in my opinion, and OpenFDA agrees. You can find code samples for OpenFDA in a Github repository, submit bug reports via the Github issue management, and even the developer portal for the OpenFDA API runs using Github Pages, and underlying repository--nice start for your <a href="https://github.com/fda">Github account OpenFDA</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Realizing This Is More Than Just Tech</strong><br /> Showcasing the idea that APIs are way more than just the underlying tech is what API Evangelist is all about, and in my opinion OpenFDA gets this 100% with their API implementation. The OpenFDA technical implementation is built using existing technology, on top of valuable open government data, providing the necessary technical building blocks to be considered a modern web API. However, OpenFDA is so much more, delivering the best first impression possible, fritctionless on-boarding, and the required education you will need to put OpenFDA to work. OpenFDA also provides the necessary feedback loop to ensure an APIs success, with updates, Twitter, StackExchange, Github, and good ol email, there will be the necessary discussion around OpenFDA that is required move things forward.</p>
<p>The OpenFDA API is in beta, but already posses many of the essential building blocks for a successful API. I&rsquo;m sure with some hacking I could find room for improvement in the API, and supporting operations. Something I will do as I have time, adding to the existing feedback I've been seeing from other beta users.  For now, I&rsquo;m impressed with the release, and when you bundle alongside other API initiatives like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/08/18f-shows-what-is-possible-in-government-with-fbopen-api/">FBOpen</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/03/significance-of-the-we-the-people-api-being-first-modern-read--write-web-api-in-government/">We The People</a>, it makes me very optimistic about what APIs are going to be able to accomplish in federal government.</p>

        <p><a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/we-the-people/we_the_people.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I finished up <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/02/my-response-to-how-can-the-department-of-education-increase-innovation-transparency-and-access-to-data/">my response to the Department of Education RFI focused around the use of APIs</a> at the government agency, a place where I&rsquo;m not just advocating for APIs, but pushing very hard for read / write APIs. I finished up my response to the RFI while waiting for my flight out of Barcelona where I spoke at <a href="http://mediterranea.apidays.io/">API Days Mediterranea</a>, where I the heard echoes of the importance role that write APIs will play in government, during a talk from Xavier Badosa (<a href="https://twitter.com/badosa">@badosa</a>).</p>
<p>All of this primed the pump for me thinking about write APIs in government, while on my flight back to Los Angeles. This will be one of the biggest challenges API evangelists in government will face in coming years, something that scares the shit out of government leaders and their legal advisors, but will also be essential to government assuming its role in the API economy.</p>
<p>A read and write strategy for some government APIs, will evolve government resources from being just a download, to being a conversation with private sector interests that are putting those resources to use. As I highlighted in my Department of Education RFI response, allowing reading and writing to government resources, combined with development of sensible service composition around these resources, and establishment of trusted access tiers, will be the connector between the public and private sector, in the API economy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not API delusional enough to believe that deploying of APIs, or even read / write APIs will automatically be a good thing in all scenarios. However the opportunity to increase access to government resources by the private sector, in a secure and controlled way, should be considered by all government agencies. When appropriate, the design and deployment of read / write APIs is bundled with all the essential <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/tools.html">building blocks for API management</a>, it has the potential to allow for a new, real-time, two way partnership to emerge between the public and private sector.</p>
<p>With this vision in mind, I can&rsquo;t help but think about the significance of the first, modern read / write web API in the United States federal government, being the We The People API. While there are other write API resources in government like the<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/irs-modernized-efile-blueprint"> IRS modernized e-file system</a>, the <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers">We The People API</a> is the first read / write API with al the hallmark characteristics of a modern web API.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy into all the bullshit rhetoric Silicon Valley and the API industry (sometimes me) spouts about APIs democratizing everything, I think they can just as easily be used in dictatorships, and efforts to lock up resources&mdash;APIs just reflect their owners objectives. Even with this, I couldn&rsquo;t think of a better read / write API initiative than the We The People platform, which provides a way for citizens to petition the White House, potentially &ldquo;giving all Americans a way to engage their government on the issues that matter to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While APIs does not automaticaly equal democracy, I think APIs will play a central role in the future of government. I will be closely watching, and hopefully even participating in the<a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/write-api-beta-testing"> We The People Write API beta initiative</a>. I&rsquo;m not sure what the outcome will be, but I think the effort is worth supporting, and if we can pull off, will be a shining example of read / write APIs in government, providing a precedent that other agencies can follow in their own efforts, hopefully opening up the floodgates for read / write APIs in government.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkKEZMjFLSQ"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/romain-apistrat-ams.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working my way through the collection of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat">talks from API Strategy &amp; Practice Amsterdam that are available on Youtube</a>, and I'm reminded of what an amazing lineup of speakers we've managed to assemble at not just #APIStrat Amsterdam, but also in San Francisco and New York.</p>
<p>Today I re-watched three videos which I think reflect not just #APIStrat, but also where we are at in the industry:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOjESChb0sU">Mike Amundsen</a> </strong>- In an effort to understand where we are going with the API economy , Mike looks back at the history of computing, trying to understand how we got here, uncovering some interesting patterns, while weaving it all together into a compelling story worthy of a Ken Burns PBS documentary.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkKEZMjFLSQ">Romain Huet</a></strong> - When selecting talks for #APIStrat we don't just select big brands, we look for the most compelling speakers, and the #APIStrat audience got both with a walk through the Twittersphere and bonus look at the convergence of Internet of Things and APIs, by taking an audience selfie, and flying a drone on stage, from Romain Huett of Twitter.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXk1dvLKl-U">Eva Sjokvist</a></strong> - Eva from Absolut Vodka wowed the #APIStrat audience with the story of their cocktail database API, which went beyond tech, and internally changed culture at the leading vodka manufacturer, teaching them how to look outside the company walls and realize the benefits of external partnerships.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working my way through other talks, but these three stand out as examples of what we look for from presenters at #APIStrat. Our speakers tell stories, wow the audience with entertaining demonstrations of the power of APIs, while showcasing how APIs have made an impact at companies, and within industries around the globe.</p>
<p>If you have an idea for a talk that you would like to share at #APIStrat in Chicago, something that you think will not just benefit the 700+ attendees, but will also push the API space forward, we want to hear from you. The only thing is you have 48 hours left to submit, before the call for papers closes. Don't miss out on being part of the conversation at #APIStrat, as well as making your mark on moving things forward&mdash;<a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/contact-call-for-papers.php">submit your talk before Thursday 5PM PDT to get in on the action</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/images/logos/ed.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spent considerable time going through the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/blog/2014/04/how-can-the-department-of-education-increase-innovation-transparency-and-access-to-data/">Department of Education RFI</a>, answering each question in as much detail as I possibly could. You can find my full response below. In the end I felt I could provide more value by summarizing my response, eliminating much of the redundancy across different sections of the RFI, and just cut through the bureaucracy as I (and APIs) prefer to do.</p>
<p><strong>Open Data By Default</strong><br /> All publicly available data at the Department of Education needs to be open by default. This is not just a mandate, this is a way of life. There is no data that is available on any Department of Education websites that should not be available for data download. Open data downloads are not separate from existing website efforts at Department of Education, they are the other side of the coin, making the same content and data available in machine readable formats, rather than available via HTML&mdash;allowing valuable resources to be used in systems and applications outside of the department&rsquo;s control.</p>
<p><strong>Open API When There Are Resources</strong><br /> The answer to whether or not the Department of Education should provide APIs is the same as whether or not the agency should deploy websites&mdash;YES! Not all individuals and companies will have the resources to download, process, and put downloadable resources to use. In these situations APIs can provide much easier access to open data resources, and when open data resources are exposed as APIs it opens up access to a much wider audience, even non-developers. Lightweight, simple, API access to open data inventory should be default along with data downloads when resources are available. This approach to APIs by default, will act as the training ground for not just 3rd party developers, but also internally, allowing Department of Education staff to learn how to manage APIs in a safe, read-only environment.</p>
<p><strong>Using A Modern API Design, Deployment, and Management Approach</strong><br /> As the usage of the Internet matured in 2000, many leading technology providers like SalesForce and Amazon began using web APIs to make digital assets available to 3rd party partners, and 14 years later there are some very proven approaches to designing, deploying and management APIs. API management is not a new and bleeding edge approach to making assets available in the private sector, there are numerous API tools and services available, and this has begun to extend to the government sector with tools like API Umbrella from NREL, being employed by api.data.gov and other agencies, as well as other tools and services being delivered by 18F from GSA. There are many proven blueprints for the Department of Education to follow when embarking on a complete API strategy across the agency, allowing innovation to occur around specific open data, and other program initiatives, in a safe, proven way.</p>
<p><strong>Use API Service Composition For Maximum Access &amp; Control</strong><br /> One benefit of 14 years of evolution around API design, deployment, and management is the establishment of sophisticated service composition of API resources. Service composition refers to the granular, modular design and deployment of APIs, while being able to manage who has access to these resources. Modern API access is not just direct, public access to a database. API service composition allows for designing exactly the access to resources that is necessary, one that is in alignment with business objectives, while protecting the privacy and security of everyone involved. Additionally service composition allows for real-time awareness of how all data, content, and other resources at the Department of Education are accessed and put to use, allowing new APIs to be designed to support specific needs, and existing APIs to evolved based upon actual demand, not just speculation.</p>
<p><strong>Deeper Understanding Of How Resources Are Used</strong><br /> A modern API service composition layer opens up possibility for a new analytics layer that is not just about measuring and reporting of access to APIs, it is about understanding precisely how resources are accessed in real-time, allowing API design, deployment and management processes to be adjusted in a more rapid and iterative way, that contributes to the roadmap, while providing the maximum enforcement of security and privacy of everyone involved.  When the Department of Education internalizes a healthy, agency-wide API approach, a new real-time understanding will replace this very RFI centered process that we are participating in, allowing for a new agility, with more control and flexibility than current approaches. A RFI cycle takes months, and will contain a great deal of speculation about what would be, where API access, coupled with healthy analytics and feedback loops, answers all the questions being addressed in this RFI, in real-time, reducing resource costs, and wasted cycles.</p>
<p><strong>APIs Open Up Synchronous and Asynchronous Communication Channels</strong><br /> Open data downloads represents a broadcast approach to making Department of Education content, data and other resources available, representing a one way street. APIs provide a two-way communication, bringing external partners and vendors closer to Department of Education, while opening up feedback loops with the Department of Education, reducing the distance between the agency and its private sector partners&mdash;potentially bringing valuable services closer to students, parents and the companies or institutions that serve them.  Feedback loops are much wider currently at the Department of Education occur on annual, monthly and at the speed of email or phone calls , with the closest being in person at events, something that can be a very expensive endeavor. Web APIs provide a real-time, synchronous and asynchronous communication layer that will improve the quality of service between Department of Education and the public, for a much lower cost than traditional approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Building External Ecosystem of Partners</strong><br />The availability of high value API resources, coupled with a modern approach to API design, deployment and management, an ecosystem of trusted partners can be established, allowing the Department of Education to share the workload with an external partner ecosystem. API service composition allows the agency to open up access to resources to only the partners who have proven they will respect the privacy and security of resources, and be dedicated to augmenting and helping extend the mission of the Department of Education. As referenced in the RFI, think about the ecosystem established by the IRS modernized e-file system, and how the H&amp;R Blocks, and Jackson Hewitt&rsquo;s of the world help the IRS share the burden of the country's tax system. Where is the trusted ecosystem for the Department of Education? The IRS ecosystem has been in development for over 25 years, something the Department of Education has to get to work on theirs now.</p>
<p><strong>Security Fits In With Existing Website Security Practices</strong><br /> One of the greatest benefits of web APIs is that they utilize existing web technologies that are employed to deploy and manage websites. You don&rsquo;t need additional security approaches to manage APIs beyond existing websites. Modern web APIs are built on HTTP, just like websites, and security can be addressed right alongside current website security practices&mdash;instead of delivering HTML, APIs are delivering JSON and XML. APIs even go further, and by using modern API service composition practices, the Department of Education gains an added layer of security and control, which introduces granular levels of access to all resource, something that does not exist for website. With a sensible analytics layer, API security isn&rsquo;t just about locking down, it is about understanding who is access resources, how they are using them, striking a balance between the security and access of resources, which is the hallmark of APIs.</p>
<p><strong>oAuth Gives Identity and Access Control To The Student</strong><br /> Beyond basic web security, and the heightened level of control modern API management deliver, there is a 3rd layer to the security and privacy layer of APis that does not exist anywhere else&mdash;oAuth. Open Authentication or oAuth provides and  identity and access layer on top of API that gives end-users, and owner of personal data control over who access their data. Technology leaders in the private sector are all using oAuth to give platform users control over how their data is used in applications and systems. oAuth is the heartbeat of API security, giving API platforms a way to manage security, and how 3rd party developers access and put resources to use, in a way that gives control to end users. In the case of the Department of Education APIs, this means putting the parent and student at the center of who accesses, and uses their personal data, something that is essential to the future of the Department of Education.</p>
<p><strong>How Will Policy Be Changed?</strong><br />I'm not a policy wonk, nor will I ever be one. One thing I do know is you will never understand the policy implications in one RFI, nor will you change policy to allow for API innovation in one broad stroke--you will fail. Policy will have to be changed incrementally, a process that fits nicely with the iterative, evolutionary life cyce of API managment. The cultural change at Department of Education, as well as evolutionary policy change at the federal level will be the biggest benefits of APIs at the Department of Education.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>An Active API Platform At Department of Education Would Deliver What This RFI Is Looking For</strong><br /> I know it is hard for the Department of Education to see APIs as something more than a technical implementation, and you want to know, understand and plan everything ahead of time&mdash;this is baked into the risk averse DNA of government. &nbsp;Even with this understanding, as I go through the RFI, I can&rsquo;t help but be frustrated by the redundancy, bureaucracy, over planning, and waste that is present in this process. An active API platform would answer every one of your questions you pose, with much more precision than any RFI can ever deliver.</p>
<p>If the Department of Education had already begun evolving an API platform for all open data sets currently available on data.gov, the agency would have the experience in API design, deployment and management to address 60% of the concerns posed by this RFI. Additionally the agency would be receiving feedback from existing integrators about what they need, who they are, and what they are building to better serve students and institutions. Because this does not exist there will be much speculation about who will use Department of Education APIs, and how they will use them and better serve students. While much of this feedback will be well meaning, it will not be rooted in actual use cases, applications and existing implementations. An active API ecosystem answers these questions, while keeping answers rooted in actual integrations, centered around specific resources, and actual next steps for real world applications.</p>
<p>The learning that occurs from managing read-only API access, to low-level data, content and resources would provide the education and iteration necessary for the key staff at Department of Education to reach the next level, which would be read / write APIs, complete with oAuth level security, which would be the holy grail in serving students and achieving the mission of the Department of Education. I know I&rsquo;m biased, because of my focus on APIs, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">read / write access to all Department of Education resources over the web and via mobile devices, that gives full control to students, is the future of the agency</span>. There is no "should we do APIs", there is only the how, and I&rsquo;m afraid we are wasting time, and we need to just do it, and learn to ask these questions along the way.</p>
<p>There is proven technology and processes available to make all Department of Education data, content and resources available, allowing both read and write access in a secure way, that is centered around the student. The private sector is 14 years ahead of the government in delivering private sector resources in this way, and other government agencies are ahead of the Department of Education in doing this as well, but there is an opportunity for the agency to still lead and take action, by committing the resources necessary to not just deploy a single API, but internalize APIs in a way that will change the way learning occurs in the coming decades across all US institutions.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>A. Information Gaps and Needs in Accessing Current Data and Aid Programs</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. How could data sets that are already publicly available be made more accessible using APIs?  Are there specific data sets that are already available that would be most likely to inform consumer choice about college affordability and performance?</strong></p>
<p>Not everyone has the resources download, process and put open datasets to use. APIs can make all of the publicly available datasets more available to the public, allowing for easy URL access, deployment of widgets, visualizations as well as integration with existing tools like Microsoft Excel. All datasets should have option of being published in this way, but ultimately the Dept. of Ed API ecosystem should speak to which datasets would be most high value, and warrant API access.</p>
<p><strong>2. How could APIs help people with successfully and accurately completing forms associated with any of the following processes: FAFSA; Master Promissory Note; Loan Consolidation; entrance and exit counseling; Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) programs,ï¿¼ 15 such as Pay As You Earn; and the Public Student Loan Forgiveness program?</strong></p>
<p>APIs will help decouple each data point on a form. Introductory information, each questions, and other supporting resources can be broken up and delivered via any website, and mobile applications. Evolving a form into a linear, 2-dimensional form into an interactive application that people can engage with, providing the assistance needed to properly achieve the goals surrounding a form.</p>
<p>Each form initiative will have its own needs, and a consistent API platform and strategy from the department of Education will help identify each forms unique requirements, and the custom delivery of just the resources that are needed for a forms target audience.</p>
<p><strong>3. What gaps are there with loan counseling and financial literacy and awareness that could be addressed through the use of APIs to provide access to government resources and content?</strong></p>
<p>First, APIs can provide access to the content that educates students about the path they are about to embark on, before they do, via web and mobile apps they frequent already, not being required to visit the source site and learn. Putting the information students need into their hands, via their mobile devices will increase the reach of content and increase the chances that students will consume.</p>
<p>Second, APIs plus oAuth will give students access over their own educational finances, forcing them to better consider how they will manage all the relationships they enter into, the details of loans, grants and with the schools they attend. With more control over data and content, will come a forced responsibility in understanding and managing their finances.</p>
<p>Third, this process will open up students eyes to the wider world of online data and information, and that APIs are driving all aspects of their financial life from their banking and credit cards to managing their online credit score.</p>
<p>APIs are at the heart of all of the API driven digital economy, the gift that would be given to students when they first leave home, in the form of API literacy would carry with them throughout their lives, allowing them to better manage all aspects of their online and financial lives&mdash;and the Department of Education gave them that start.</p>
<p><strong>4. What services that are currently provided by title IV student loan servicers could be enhanced through APIs (e.g., deferment, forbearance, forgiveness,  cancellation, discharge, payments)?</strong></p>
<p>A consistent API platform and strategy from the department of Education would provide the evolution of a suite of verified partners, such as title IV student loan services. A well planned partner layer within an ecosystem would allow student loan services to access data from students in real-time, with students having a say in who and how they have access to the data. These dynamics introduced by, and unique to API platforms that employ oAuth, provide new opportunities for partnerships to be established, evolve and even be terminated when not going well.</p>
<p>API platform using oAuth provide a unique 3-legged relationship between the data platform, 3rd party service providers and students (users), that can be adopted to bring in existing industry partners, but more importantly provide a rich environment for new types of partners to evolve, that can improve the overall process and workflow a student experiences.</p>
<p><strong>5. What current forms or programs that already reach prospective students or borrowers in distress could be expanded to include broader affordability or financial literacy information?</strong></p>
<p>All government forms and programs should be evaluated for the pros / cons of an API program. My argument within this RFI response will be focused on a consistent API platform and strategy from the department of Education. APIs should be be part of every existing program change, and new initiatives in the future.</p>
<p><strong>B. Potential Needs to be Filled by APIs</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. If APIs were available, what types of individuals, organizations, and companies would build tools to help increase access to programs to make college more affordable?</strong></p>
<p>A consistent API platform and strategy from the department of Education will have two essential components, partner framework, and service composition. A partner framework defines which external, 3rd party groups can work with Department of Education API resources. The service composition defines how these 3rd party groups can can access and ultimately use Department of Education API resources.</p>
<p>All existing groups that the Department of Education interacts with currently should be evaluated for where in the API partner framework they exists, defining levels of access for general public, student up to certified and trusted developer and business partnerships.</p>
<p>The partner framework and service composition for the Department of Education API platform should be applied to all existing individuals, organizations and companies, while also allow for new actors to enter the game, and potentially redefining the partner framework and add new formulas for API service composition, opening up the possibilities for innovation around Department of Education API resources.</p>
<p><strong>2. What applications and features might developers, schools, organizations, and companies take interest in building using APIs in higher education data and services?</strong></p>
<p>As with which Department of Education forms and programs might have APIs apply, which individuals, organizations and companies will use APIs, the only way to truly understand what applications might developers, schools, organizations and companies put APIs cannot be know, until it is place. These are the questions an API centric company or institution asks of its API platform in real-time. You can&rsquo;t define who will use an API and how they will use it, it takes iteration and exploration before successful applications will emerge.</p>
<p><strong>3. What specific ways could APIs be used in financial aid processes (e.g., translation of financial aid forms into other languages, integration of data collection into school or State forms)?</strong></p>
<p>When a resource is available via an API, it is broken down into the smallest possible parts and pieces possible, allowing them to be re-used, and re-purposed into every possible configuration management. When you make form questions independently available via an API, it allows you to possible reorder, translate, and ask in new ways.</p>
<p>This approach works well with forms, allowing each entry of a form to be accessible, transferable, and open up for access, with the proper permissions and access level that is owned by the person who owns the format data. This opens up not just the financial aid process, but all form processes to interoperate with other systems, forms, agencies and companies.</p>
<p>With the newfound modularity and interoperability introduced by APIs, the financial aid process could be broken down, allowing parents to take part for their role, schools for theirs, and allow multiple agencies to be engaged such as IRS or Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). All of this allows any involved entity or system to do its part for the financial aid process, minimizing the friction throughout the entire form process, even year over year.</p>
<p><strong>4. How can third-party organizations use APIs to better target services and information to low-income students, first-generation students, non-English speakers, and students with disabilities?</strong></p>
<p>Again, this is a questions that should be asked in real-time of a Department of Education platform. Examples of how 3rd party organizations can better target services and information to students, is the reason for an API platform. There is no way to no this ahead of time, I will leave to domain experts to attempt at answering.</p>
<p><strong>5. Would APIs for higher education data, processes, programs or services be useful in enhancing wraparound support service models? What other types of services could be integrated with higher education APIs?</strong></p>
<p>A sensibly design,deployed, managed and evangelized API platform would establish a rich environment for existing educational services to be augmented, but also allow for entirely new types of services to be defined.  Again I will leave to domain experts to speak of specific service implantations based upon their goals, and understanding of the space.</p>
<p><strong>C. Existing Federal and Non-Federal Tools Utilizing APIs</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. What private-sector or non-Federal entities currently offer assistance with higher education data and student aid programs and processes by using APIs?  How could these be enhanced by the Department&rsquo;s enabling of additional APIs?</strong></p>
<p>There are almost 10K public APIs available in the private sector. This should be viewed as a pallet for developers, and something that developers use as they are developing (painting) their apps (painting). It is difficult for developers to know what they will be painting with, without knowing what resources are available.  The open API innovation process rarely is able to articulate what is needed, then make that request for resources&mdash;API innovations occurs when valuable, granular resources are available fro multiple sources, ad developers assemble them, and innovate in new ways.</p>
<p><strong>2. What private-sector or non-Federal entities currently work with government programs and services to help people fill out government forms? Has that outreach served the public and advanced public interests?</strong></p>
<p>Another question that should be answered by the Department of of Education, and providing us with the answers. How would you know this without a properly definitely partner framework? Stand up an API platform, and you will have the answer.</p>
<p><strong>3. What instances or examples are there of companies charging fees to assist consumers in completing otherwise freely available government forms from other agencies? What are the advantages and risks to consider when deciding to allow third parties to charge fees to provide assistance with otherwise freely available forms and processes? How can any risks be mitigated?</strong></p>
<p>I can't speak to what is already going on in the space, regarding companies charging feeds to consumers, I am not expert on the education space at this level. This is just such a new paradigm made possible via APIs and open data, there just aren&rsquo;t that many examples in the space, built around open government data.</p>
<p>First, the partner tiers of API platforms help verify and validate individuals and organizations who are building applications and charging for services in the space. A properly design, managed and policed partner tier can assist in mitigating risk in the evolution of such business ecosystems.</p>
<p>Second API driven security layers using oAuth give access to end-users, allowing students to take control over which applications and ultimately service providers have access to their data, revoking when services are done or a provider is undesirable. With proper reporting and rating systems, policing of the API platform can be something that is done within the community, and the last mile of policing being done by the Department of Education.</p>
<p>Proper API management practices provide the necessary identity, access and control layers necessary to keep resources and end-users safe. Ultimately who has access to data, can charge fees, and play a role in the ecosystem is up to Department of education and end-users when applications are built on top of APIs.</p>
<p><strong>4. Beyond the IRS e-filing example, what other similar examples exist where Federal, State, or local government entities have used APIs to share government data or facilitate participation in government services or processes - particularly at a scale as large as that of the Federal Student Aid programs?</strong></p>
<p>This is a new, fast growing sector, and there are not a lot of existing examples, but there area few:</p>
<p>Open311<br /> An API driven system that allows citizens to report and interact with municipalities around issues within communities. While Open311 is deployed in specific cities such as Chicago and Baltimore, it is an open source platform and API that can be deployed to serve any size market.</p>
<p>Census Bureau<br /> The US Census provides open data and APIs, allowing for innovation around government census survey data, used across the private sector in journalism, healthcare, and many other ways. The availability of government census data is continually spawning new applications, visualizations and other expressions, that wouldn&rsquo;t be realized or known, if the platform wasn&rsquo;t available.</p>
<p>We The People<br /> The We The People API allows for 3rd-Party integration with the White House Petition process. Currently only allowing for read only access to the information, and the petition process, but is possibly one way that write APIs will emerge in federal government.</p>
<p>There are numerous examples of open APIs and data being deployed in government, even from the Department of Education. All of them are works in progress, and will realize their full potential over time, maturation and much iteration and engagement with the public.</p>
<p><strong>D. Technical Specifications</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. What elements would a read-write API need to include for successful use at the Department?</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous building blocks can be employed in managing read-write APIs, but there are a couple that will be essential to successful read-write APIs in government:</p>
<p>Partner Framework<br /> Defined access tiers for consumers of API data, with appropriate public, partner and private (internal) levels of access. All write methods are only accessible by partner and internal levels of access, requiring verification and certification of companies and individuals who will be building on top of API resources.</p>
<p>Service Management<br /> The ability to compose many different types of API resource access, create service bundles that are made accessible to different levels of partners. Service management allows for identity and access management, but also billing, reporting, and other granular level control over how services are composed, accessed and managed.</p>
<p>Open Authentication (oAuth 2.0)<br /> All data made available via Department of Education API platforms and involves personally identifiable information will require the implementation of an open authentication or oAuth security layer. oAuth 2.0 provides an identity layer for the platform, requiring developers to use token that throttle access to resources for applications, a process that is initiated, managed and revoked by end-users&mdash;providing the highest level of control over who has access to data, and what they can do with it, by the people who personal data is involved.</p>
<p>Federated API Deployments<br /> Not all APIs should be deployed and managed within the Department of Education firewall. API platforms can be made open source so that 3rd party partners can deploy within their own environments. Then via a sensible partner framework, the Department of Education can decide which partners they should not just allow to write to APIs, but also pull data from their trusted systems and open API deployments.</p>
<p>APIs provide the necessary access to all of federal government API resources, and a sensible partner framework, service management layer in conjunction with oAuth will provide the necessary controls for a read / write API in government. If agencies are looking to further push risk outside the firewall, federated API deployments with trusted partners will have to be employed.</p>
<p><strong>2. What data, methods, and other features must an API contain in order to develop apps accessing Department data or enhancing Department processes, programs, or services?</strong></p>
<p>There are about 75 common building blocks for API deployments (http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html), aggregated after looking at almost 10K public API deployments. Each government API will have different needs when it comes to other supporting building blocks.</p>
<p><strong>3. How would read-only and/or read-write APIs interact with or modify the performance of the Department&rsquo;s existing systems (e.g., FAFSA on the Web)?  Could these APIs negatively or positively affect the current operating capability of such systems?  Would  these APIs allow for the flexibility to evolve seamlessly with the Department&rsquo;s technological developments?</strong></p>
<p>There are always risks with API access to resources, but a partner framework, service management, oAuth, and other common web security practices these risks can be drastically reduce, and mitigated in real-time</p>
<p>Isolated API Deployments<br /> New APIs should rarely be deployed and directly connected to existing systems. APIs can be deployed as an isolated interface, with an isolated data store. Existing systems can use the same API interface to read / write data into the system and keep in sync with existing internal systems. API developers will never have access to existing system and data stores, just isolated, defined API interfaces as part of a secure partner tier, only accessing the services they have permission to, and the end-user data that has been given access to by end-users themselves.</p>
<p>Federated Deployments<br /> As described above, if government agencies are looking to further reduce risk, API deployments can be designed and deployed as open source software, allowing partners with the ecosystem to download and deploy. A platform partner framework can provide a verification and certification process for federal API deployments, allowing the Department of Education to decide who they will pull data from, reducing the risk to internal systems, providing a layer of trust for integration.</p>
<p>Beyond these approaches to deploying APIs, one of the biggest benefits of web API deployments is they use the same security as other government websites, just possessing an additional layer of securing determining who has access, and to what.</p>
<p>It should be the rare instance when an existing system will have an API deployed with direct integration. API automation will provide the ability to sync API deployments with existing systems and data stores.</p>
<p><strong>4. What vulnerabilities might read-write APIs introduce for the security of the underlying databases the Department currently uses?</strong></p>
<p>As stated above, there should be no compromise in how data is imported into existing databases at the Department of Education. It is up to the agency to decide which APIs they pull data from, and how it is updated as part of existing systems.</p>
<p><strong>5. What are the potential adverse effects on successful operation of the Department&rsquo;s underlying databases that read-write APIs might cause? How could APIs be developed to avoid these adverse effects?</strong></p>
<p>As stated above, isolated and external, federated API deployments will decouple the risk from existing systems. This is the benefit of APIs, is they can deployed as isolated resources, then integration and interoperability, internally and externally is up to the consumer to decide what is imported and what isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><strong>6. How should APIs address application-to-API security?</strong></p>
<p>Modern API partner framework, service management and oath provide the necessary layer to identify who has access, and what resources can be used by not just a company and user, but by each application they have developed.</p>
<p>Routing all API access through the partner framework plus associated service level, will secure access to Department of Education resources  by applications, with user and app level logging of what was accessed and used within an application.</p>
<p>OAuth provides a balance to this application to API security layer, allowing the Department of Education to manage security of API access, developers to request access for their applications, but ultimately control is in the hand of end users to define which applications have access to their data.</p>
<p><strong>7. How should the APIs address API-to-backend security issues?  Examples include but are not limited to authentication, authorization, policy enforcement, traffic management, logging and auditing, TLS (Transport Layer Security), DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) prevention, rate limiting, quotas, payload protection, Virtual Private Networks, firewalls, and analytics.</strong></p>
<p>Web APIs use the exact same infrastructure as websites, allowing for the re-use of existing security practices employed for websites. However APIs provide the added layer of security, logging, auditing and analytics provided through the lens of the partner framework, service composition and only limited by the service management tooling available.</p>
<p><strong>8. How do private or non-governmental organizations optimize the presentation layer for completion and accuracy of forms?</strong></p>
<p>Business rules. As demonstrated as part of a FAFSA API prototype, business rules for each form field, along with rejection codes can also be made available via an API resources, allowing for developers to build in a form validation layer into all digital forms.</p>
<p>After submission, and the first line of defense provide red by API developers building next generation forms, platform providers can provide further validation, review and ultimately a status workflow that allows forms to be rejected or accepted based upon business logic.</p>
<p><strong>9. What security parameters are essential in ensuring there is no misuse, data mining, fraud, or misrepresentation propagated through use of read- only or read-write APIs?</strong></p>
<p>A modern API service management layer allows the platform provider to see all API resources that are being access, by whom, and easily establish patterns for healthy usage, as well as patterns for misuse. When misuse is identified, service management allows providers to revoke access, and take action against companies and individuals.</p>
<p>Beyond the platform provider, APIs allow for management by end-users through common oAuth flows and management tools. Sometimes end-users can identify an app is misusing their data, even before a platform provider might. oAuth gives them the control to revoke access to their data, via the API platform.</p>
<p>oauth, combined with API service management tooling has allowed for a unique security environment in which the platform can easily keep operations healthy, but end-users and developers can help police the ecosystem as well. If platform providers give users the proper rating and reporting tools, they can help keep API and data consumers in check.</p>
<p><strong>10. With advantages already built into the Department&rsquo;s own products and services (e.g., IRS data retrieval using FAFSA on the Web), how would new, third-party API-driven products present advantages over existing Department resources?</strong></p>
<p>While existing products and services developed within the department do provide great value, the Department of Education cannot do everything on their own. Because of the access the Department has, some features will be better by default, but this won&rsquo;t be the case in all situations.</p>
<p>The Department of Education and our government does not have unlimited resources, and with access to ALL resources available via the department the private sector can innovate, helping share the load of delivering vital services. Its not whether or not public sector products and services are better than private sector or vice vera, it is about the public sector and private sector partnering wherever and whenever it make sense.</p>
<p><strong>11. What would an app, service or tool built with read-write API access to student aid forms look like?</strong></p>
<p>Applications will look like turbotax and tax act developed within the IRS ecosystem, and look like the tools developed by the Sunlight Foundation on top of government open data and APIs.</p>
<p>We will never understand what applications are possible until the necessary government resources are available. All digital assets should be open by default, with consistent API platform and strategy from the department of Education, and the platform will answer this question.</p>
<p><strong>E. Privacy Issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. How could the Department use APIs that involve the use of student records while ensuring compliance with potentially applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. &sect; 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) and the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. &sect; 552a and 34 CFR Part 5b)?</strong></p>
<p>As described above the partner framework, service management and oAuth layer provides the control and logging necessary to execute and audit as part of any application statutory and regulatory requirement.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t articulate enough how this layer provides a tremendous amount of control over how these resources are access, giving control to the involved parties who matter the most&mdash;end-users. All API traffic is throttled, measured and reviewed as part of service management, enforcing privacy that in a partnership between the Department of Education, API consumers and end-users.</p>
<p><strong>2. How could APIs ensure that the appropriate individual has provided proper consent to permit the release of privacy-protected data to a third party? How can student data be properly safeguarded to prevent its release and use by third parties without the written consent often required?</strong></p>
<p>As articulated above the partner framework, service management and oAuth address this. This is a benefit of API deployment, breaking down existing digital access, providing access and granular control, combined with oAuth and logging of all access&mdash;APIs take control to a new level.</p>
<p>oAuth has come to represent this new balance in security and control of digital resources, allowing the platform, developers and end-users to execute within their defined role on the platform. This balance introduced by APIs and oAuth, allow data to be safeguarded, while also opening up for the widest possible use in the next generation applications and other implementations.</p>
<p><strong>3. How might read-only or read-write APIs collect, document, and track individuals&rsquo; consent to have their information shared with specific third parties?</strong></p>
<p>oAuth. Period.</p>
<p><strong>4. How can personally identifiable information (PII) and other financial information (of students and parents) be safeguarded through the use of APIs?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Access of personally identifiable information (PII) via Department of Education APIs will be controlled by students and their parents. The most important thing you can do to protect PII is to give the owner of that data, education about how to allow developer access to it in responsible ways that will benefit them.</strong></p>
<p>APIs open up access, while oAuth will give the students and parents the control they need to integrate with apps, and existing system to achieve their goals, while retaining the greatest amount of over safeguarding their own data.</p>
<p><strong>5. What specific terms of service should be enabled using API keys, which would limit use of APIs to approved users, to ensure that information is not transmitted to or accessed by unauthorized parties?</strong></p>
<p>A well designed partner layer would define multiple level of access, combined with sensible service packages, will establish the terms of service levels that will be bundled with API keys and oAuth level identity and access to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Common approaches to deploying partner layers with appropriate service tiers, using oAuth have been well established over the last 10 years in the private sector.  Controlling access to API resources at a granular level, providing the greatest amount of access that makes sense, while knowing who is access data and how they are using is what APIs are designed for.</p>
<p><strong>6. What are the relative privacy-related advantages and disadvantages of using read-only versus read-write APIs for student aid data?</strong></p>
<p>You will face many of the similar privacy concerns whether an API is read or write. If it is personably identifiable information, read or write access to the wrong parties violates a student's privacy. Just ensure that data is updated via trusted application providers is essential.</p>
<p>A properly defined partner layer will separate who has read and who has write access. Proper logging and versioning of data is essential to ensure data integrity, allowing end-users to manage their data via an application or system with confidence.</p>
<p><strong>F. Compliance Issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. What are the relative compliance-related advantages and disadvantages of using read-only versus read-write APIs for student aid data?</strong></p>
<p>APIs provide a single point of access to student aid data. With the implementation of proper partner framework, service management and oAuth every single action via this doorway is controlled and logged. When it comes to auditing ALL operations whether it is from the public, partners or internal, APIs excel in satisfying compliance concerns.</p>
<p><strong>2. How can the Department prevent unauthorized use and the development of unauthorized products from occurring through the potential development of APIs? How might the Department enforce terms of service for API key holders, and prevent abuse and fraud by non-API key holders, if APIs were to be developed and made available?</strong></p>
<p>As described above the partner framework, service management and oAuth will provide the security layer needed to manage 99% of potential abuse, but overall enforcement via the API platform is a partnership between the Department of Education, API consumers as well as end-users.  The last mile of enforcement will be executed by the Department of Education, but it will be up to the entire ecosystem and platform to police and enforce in real-time.</p>
<p><strong>3. What kind of burden on the Department is associated with enforcing terms and conditions related to APIs?</strong></p>
<p>The Department of Education will handle the first line of defense, in defining partner tiers and service composition that wraps all access to APis. The Department will also be the last mile of decision making and enforcement when violations occur. The platform should provide the data needed by the department to make decision as well as the enforcement necessary in the form of API key and access revocation, and banning apps, individuals and business from the ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>4. How can the Department best ensure that API key holders follow all statutory and regulatory provisions of accessing federal student aid funds and data through use of third-party products?</strong></p>
<p>First line of define to ensure that API key holders follow all statutory and regulatory provision will be verification and validation of partners upon registration, applications going into production and availability in application galleries and other directories in which students discover apps.</p>
<p>Second line of defense will be reporting requirements and usage patterns of API consumers and their apps. If applications regular meet self-reporting requirements and real-time patterns establishing healthy or unhealthy behavior, they can retain their certification. If partners fail to comply they will be restricted from the API ecosystem.</p>
<p>Last line of defense is the end-users, the students and parents. All end-users need to be educated regarding the control they have, given reporting and ranking tools that allow them file complaints and rank the applications that are providing quality services.</p>
<p>As stated several times, enforcement will be a community effort, something the Department of Education has ultimate control of, but requires giving the community agency as well.</p>
<p><strong>5. How could prior consent from the student whom the data is about be provided for release of privacy- protected data to third party entities?</strong></p>
<p>An API with oAuth layer is this vehicle. Providing the access, logging all transactions, and holding all partners to a quality of service. All the mechanism are there, in a modern API implementation, the access just needs to be defined.</p>
<p><strong>6. How should a legal relationship between the Department and an API developer or any other interested party be structured?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a lawyer. I&rsquo;m not a policy person. Just can&rsquo;t contribute to this one.</p>
<p><strong>7. How would a legal relationship between the Department and an API developer or any other interested party affect the Department&rsquo;s current agreements with third-party vendors that operate and maintain the Department&rsquo;s existing systems?</strong></p>
<p>All of this will be defined in each partner tier, combined with appropriate service levels. With isolated API deployments, this should not affect currently implementations.</p>
<p>However a benefit of consistent API strategy is that existing vendors can access resources via APis, increasing the agility and flexibility of existing contracts. APIs are a single point of access, not just for the public, but 3rd party partners as well as internal access.  Everyone involved can participate and receive benefits of API consumption.</p>
<p><strong>8. What disclosures should be made available to students about what services are freely available in government domains versus those that could be offered at a cost by a third party?</strong></p>
<p>A partner tier for the API platform will define the different levels of partners. Trusted, verified and certified partners will get different recommendation levels and access than lesser known services, and applications from 3rd party with lesser trusted levels of access.</p>
<p><strong>9. If the Department were to use a third-party application to engage with the public on its behalf, how could the Department ensure that the Department follows the protocols of OMB Memorandum 10-23?</strong></p>
<p>Again, the partner tier determines the level of access to the partner and the protocols of all OMB memorandum call be built in. Requiring all data, APIs and code is open sourced, and uses appropriate API access tiers showing how data and resources are accessed and put to use.</p>
<p>API service management provides the reporting necessary to support government audits and regulations. Without this level of control on top of an API, this just isn&rsquo;t possible in a scalable way, that APIs plus web and mobile applications offer.</p>
<p><strong>G. Policy Issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. What benefits to consumers or the Department would be realized by opening what is currently a free and single-point service (e.g., the FAFSA) to other entities, including those who may charge fees for freely-available services and processes?  What are the potential unintended consequences?</strong></p>
<p>Providing API access to government resources is an efficient and sensible use of taxpayers money, and reflect the mission of all agencies, not just the Department of Education. APIs introduce the agility and flexibility needed to deliver the next generation government application and services.</p>
<p>The economy in a digital age will require a real-time partnership between the public sector and the private sector, and APIs are the vehicle for this. Much like it has done for private sector companies like Amazon and Google, APIs will allow the government to create new services and products that serve constituents with the help of the private sector, while also stimulating job growth and other aspects of the economy.</p>
<p>APIs will not all be an up-side, each program and initiative will have its own policy problems and unintended consequences. One problem that plagues API initiatives is enough resources in the form of money and skilled works to make sure efforts are successful. Without the proper management, poorly executed APIs can open up huge security holes, introduce privacy concerns at a scale never imagined.</p>
<p>APIs need to be managed properly, with sensible real-time controls for keeping operations in check.</p>
<p><strong>2. How could the Department ensure that access to title IV, HEA student aid programs truly remains free, even amidst the potential development of third-party apps that may charge a fee for assistance in participating in free government programs, products, and services with or without providing legitimate value-added services?</strong></p>
<p>Partner Framework + Service Management = Quality of Service Across Platform</p>
<p><strong>3. What other policy concerns should the Department consider with regard to the potential development of APIs for higher education data and student aid processes at the Department?</strong></p>
<p>Not a policy or education expert, I will leave this to others to determine. Also something that should be built into API operations, and discovered on a program by program basis.</p>
<p><strong>4. How would APIs best interact with other systems already in use in student aid processes (e.g., within States)?</strong></p>
<p>The only way you will know is if you do it. How is the IRS-efile system helping with this, but it isn&rsquo;t even a perfect model to follow. We will never know the potential here until a platform is stood up, and resources are made available. All signs point to APIs opening up a huge amount of interoperability between not just states and the federal government, but also with cities and counties.</p>
<p><strong>5. How would Department APIs benefit or burden institutions participating in title IV, HEA programs?</strong></p>
<p>If APIs aren&rsquo;t given the proper resources to operate it can introduce security, privacy and support concerns that would not have been there before. A properly run API initiative will provide support, while an underfunded, undermanned initiative will just further burden institutions.</p>
<p><strong>6. While the Department continues to enhance and refine its own processes and products (e.g., through improvements to FAFSA or the IDR application process), how would third-party efforts using APIs complement or present challenges to these processes?</strong></p>
<p>These two things should not be separate. The internal efforts should be seen as just another partner layer within the API ecosystem. All future service and products developed internally within the Department of Education should use the same API infrastructure developed for partners and the public.</p>
<p>If APIs are not used internally, API efforts will always fail. APIs are not just about providing access to external resources, it is about opening up the Department to think about its resources in an external way that benefits the public, partners as well as within the government.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/05/29/the-swagger-specification/">The Swagger Specification</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 May 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/Swagger-Logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><em>This post is an exact copy from the<a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec"> Swagger specification page</a>, on the Swagger Github project. As I was reviewing the latest Swagger 2.0 release, I read this descripton, and I really felt it caputred not ust the mission of Swagger, but spoke to the essence of API design. With this in mind I wanted to re-post, as part of my ongoing coverage of the API design space.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The goal of Swagger&trade; is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swager removes the guesswork in calling the service.</p>
<p>Use cases for machine-readable API interfaces include interactive documentation, code generation for documentation, client, and server, as well as automated test cases. Swagger-enabled APIs expose JSON files that correctly ahere to the Swagger Specification, documented in this repository. These files can either be produced and served statically, or be generated dynamically from your application.</p>
<p>Without going into a long history of interfaces to Web Services, this is not the first attempt to do so. We can learn from CORBA, WSDL and WADL. These specifications had good intentions but were limited by proprietary vendor-specific implementations, being bound to a specific programming language, and goals which were too open-ended. In the end, they failed to gain traction.</p>
<p>Swagger does not require you to rewrite your existing API. It does not require binding any software to a service--the service being described may not even be yours. It does, however, require the capabilities of the service be described in the structure of the Swagger Specification. Not all services can be described by Swagger--this specification is not intended to cover every possible use-case of a REST-ful API. Swagger does not define a specific development process such as design-first or code-first. It does facilitate either technique by establishing clear interactions with a REST API.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec">GitHub project is the starting point for Swagger</a>. Here you will find the information you need about the Swagger Specification, a simple static sample of what it looks like, and some general information regarding the project.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/05/23/why-apis-should-be-designed-by-linguists/">Why APIs Should Be Designed By Linguists</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">23 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/linguistics/why-apis-should-be-designed-by-linguists.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly evangelizing how APIs bring individuals and companyies out of their silos and stimulate conversations internally amongst distributed groups,co and externally with partners and the public.</p>
<p>During a federal government panel this Monday in Maryland, I was facilitating a discussion between NASA, GSA, the White House, with participation from Energy, FEMA and other agencies. It was mentioned several times that APIs were facilitating conversation beyond what just a data download does, in a way that changed culture, making APIs more about people than technology&mdash;something that is core to my mission as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>A well crafted API, with essential building blocks like interactive documentation, blogs, forums, active social media accounts, create valuable feedback loops that stimulate conversation around valuable API resources, and the applications and sites that put them use.</p>
<p>Then later this week, at Gluecon in Colorado, I saw a talk from Rebecca Standig (<a href="https://twitter.com/understandig">@understandig</a>), linguist and software engineer at <a href="https://keen.io/">Keen.io,</a> that blew my mind, taking the concept of APIs and communication to a whole new level. Rebecca connected the dots between linguistics, the need for linguists to have programming skills, and the potential when they design APIs. I&rsquo;m still processing everything she said, and told her I&rsquo;d like to work together more to tell stories about lingistics and APIs, so there will be more stories on this subject, but I had to share my initial thoughts while I was processing my Evernote from the talk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always working to craft meaningful stories in the API space, that will help people understand the potential of APIs. Throughout my evangelism I&rsquo;m encouraging companies, organizations and government agencies to employ APIs that will help stimulate conversation with employees, partners and the public. What Rebecca is proposing takes this to a whole new level for me, and opening up new possibilities for how we configure applications to communicate, in a way that is rooted in, and derived from our own understanding of how humans communicate.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">Restaurant Menus As Analogy For API Copyright</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">23 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-restaurant-menu.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of the interesting conversations that came out of the <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Gluecon/">APIStrat Un-Workshops at Gluecon</a> this week, was the exploration of the analogy of applying copyright to restaurant menus, and applying copyright to APIs. This type of conversations is why 3Scale and API Evangelist support these types of events.</p>
<p>When you Google the topic of restaurant menu API copyright, you get a wealth of contradictory answers that show the difficulty of applying copyright to menus. In practice you can put a copyright on your menu, and you could probably spend a lot of energy enforcing this if someone copies your menu. In reality, it will probably be pretty hard to win, unless your menu is exactly copied, and a fair use claim couldn&rsquo;t be enforced.</p>
<p>One interesting layer in this discussion, is the ubiquity of restaurant menus, and even the order, naming and organization of these menus. A phase I don&rsquo;t think APIs have reached, but will at some point. It is pretty difficult to argue that menus are essential to interoperability, meaning you can sit down at any restaurant and the menu contributes to you on boarding with the restaurant experience. Imagine if you had to know to ask for food via a chalkboard, or pick up some phone to call in what you wanted, without knowing any orderly way of understanding what a restaurant provided? Each restaurant would be different, and screw up the whole thing.</p>
<p>I would argue that bookmarks, images, video and other common API designs are just like hamburgers, steaks, and salads, when I explore this analogy. I think a lot of the confusion in the API copyright discussion is around the separation between an API and the API definition. The order and layout of restaurant menu is not the restaurant, just like the API design is not the API.</p>
<p>Could you imagine enforcing copyright on a american restaurant or diner menu layout? Maybe with fast food, which is not about delivering value, but maximizing profit. I think things are just newer in the API space vs the restaurant industry, but the analogy holds up. As a restaurant, your menu is not your restaurant. If someone copies your menu exactly, and opens up across the street, you may have a copyright case where fair use may be hard to defend, but in the end is their steak dinner the same as your steak dinner? Ultimately it comes down to your service, ingredients, presentation, price, ambiance and the other building blocks of a restaurant.</p>
<p>This same thought process can be applied to APIs. If you offer an image API, and someone copies your image API design exactly, the APIs are not exact copies. What you have behind the API design is the value, and represents your company&rsquo;s intellectual property, not the API design. Allowing your API definition to be copied will increase interoperability, and increase the chance developers will build clients, and other tooling that encourages interoperability&mdash;think about Amazon EC2 and S3. Does every copy of the API design deliver the exact same value as Amazon API? I think not.</p>
<p>In the end, if you don&rsquo;t see the separation between an API and its design, the benefits that an open API design delivers to not just an individual API ecosystem, but the overall API sector, you probably don&rsquo;t understand APIs well enough, and /or you are just concerned too much with monetization and control, and you really don&rsquo;t belong in the API space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm guessing that we will end up with the fast food of APIs who really don't offer much value, but actively enforce their brand, which is tightly coupled with their API design. Even with this shit in the market, the rest of us can work hard to offer high quality APIs, which employ open API designs.</p>

<p>When I run into enterprise folks at events, one of the common characteristics I notice, is they always tell me how much they read my blog. Yay! Many of these people have Twitter accounts, which follow me and I follow them, and they can usually reference specific topics or posts I've written&mdash;demonstrating they do indeed read.</p>
<p>Most of these people I'm aware of online, and I usually consider them fence sitters. They rarely retweet posts, or engage in conversations online, they just consume. I think this is fine, because not all everyone is suited for actively engaging in the social media world. What I do think is interesting is how interested they are in my work, and they let me know how my work reaches them, and reference specific topics and stories, but don&rsquo;t actually contribute to the conversation.</p>
<p>In my opinion this isn't individuals faults, this is enterprise culture. Businesses of this scale are not equipped to deliver value unless it is sanctioned and specifically part of the larger brand. The enterprise generates value, but only when in service of their business objectives. Generating open value for a community, even as small as a retweet, comment, or a response in blog post, is not in the DNA.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that businesses should generate just as much value as they consume. I&rsquo;m not stupid. I understand that capitalism is about extracting value and monetizing for shareholders, but can&rsquo;t help but think about what this existence is like for these individuals.</p>
<p>Personally, I find it very rewarding to contributing to communities, and the overall health of the API community, by contributing ideas, engaging in conversations, without the expectation that it will all result in revenue for <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>. Ultimately all of this effort comes back to me, and ensures I will be able to sustain my evangelism efforts, while also nourishing my own individual needs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/steve-apistrat-gluecon.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still gathering my thoughts from the deep technical conversations that occurred on Tuesday at the <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Gluecon/">Gluecon APIStrat Un-Workshops</a>&nbsp;in Colorado. Before the official <a href="http://gluecon.com/">Gluecon festivities</a> kicked off, 3Scale and API Evangelist held a 5 hour un-workshop where approximately 70 API professionals gathered to discuss some of the most pressing topics in the API space.</p>
<p><strong>Internet of Things</strong><br /> One of the fastest growing areas of the API design and deployment, is in support of the Internet of things (IoT). During the IoT portion we had some interesting conversation around how APIs enable communication in Iot world, including some heated discussion about whether or not HTTP will scale and handle the fast growing Iot space.</p>
<p><strong>API Versioning</strong><br /> One of the hot topics proposed within the API design un-workshop was API versioning, which I thought would be a technical dive into versioning, but ended up being more of the human side of versioning, and communicating with your API consumers&mdash;clearly setting expectations around the how and why of API versioning.</p>
<p><strong>Real-Time</strong><br /> Dovetailing nicely with the Iot discussion, there was a very enlightening discussion around real-time, which covered one of the most fundamental issues of real-time&mdash;what is it? As with the API versioning discussion, the conversation took gave a nod to the human side of tech, acknowledging real-time was more about expectations of end-users and providers, than about technology.</p>
<p><strong>API Copyright</strong><br /> As expected the topic of API copyright was a major part of the discussion, not just at the APIStart Un-workshops, but also the wider Gluecon. A group of us walked through the legal case, where everything stands with API Commons, and how we can best take the offensive attack on the issue as a community, which includes educating more API providers, consumers and business owners.</p>
<p><strong>API Design &amp; Discovery</strong><br /> Emphasizing the importance of the release of <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> and <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a>, and the conversations around <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>, a portion of the API design workshop walked through the available API definition formats, and ultimately how APIs are discovered. The conversation went beyond classic API directories, and the newer approaches to search introduced by APIs.io, and discussed IDE integration for API discovery, as well as in the Internet of Things&mdash;again showing the overlap of all the areas of discussion at APIStrat&nbsp;Un-workshops.</p>
<p>The APIStrat Un-workshops were broken into two main groups, API design and Internet of things, while each of the un-workshops started with lightning talks from relative providers, the rest of the un-workshops were just open conversations around a table between all participants&mdash;making them very organic discussions.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t get a chance to participate at Gluecon, the conversations will continue online with blot posts from each of the group leaders in the discussions on API Evangelist, as well as at A<a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">PI Strategy &amp; Practice</a>, where we will be structuring sessions, panels and more workshops to keep the dialogue going.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 May 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-design.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In 2014 <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">API design</a> is exploding, proving to be one of the fastest growing areas of the API industry. For many years we&rsquo;ve talked purely about API management, but after consolidation in the space, and serious growth, the conversation has shifted.</p>
<p>The API conversation is moving upstream in the API lifecycle, focusing on designing, mocking, and collaborating around designing the best quality APIs possible, that will meet the needs of consumers--before any code is written and deployed.</p>
<p>A new wave of API design companies have zeroed in on supporting healthy API design practices by providing tools like <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary.io</a> which allow you to mock, design and collaborate early on in API design process. This new wave of tools and service is meant to foster the healthiest possible design practices, and is cultivating an expanding army of knowledgeable API designers, who demonstrate that API design can be more art than science and technology.</p>
<p>Amid this rapid expansion we are witnessing the potentially damaging effects of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/05/10/where-will-your-api-stand-in-the-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-debate/">Oracle v Google legal battle</a>, which is looking to inject unnecessary concerns around copyright into this blossoming API design sector. What will the copyright of APIs do to the API design process?</p>
<p>Will API design be as creative when you have to be concerned with designing unique interfaces vs creating with the best of breed API design patterns that are already available in the space? Will you design for quality of interfaces, the needs of your consumers and interoperability, the lifeblood of APIs, when you are focused on copyright and your API definitions become about legal protection and not access and innovation as they were intended?</p>
<p>If the precedent is set that copyright indeed applies to web APIs, I think that one of the chilling waves that will ripple through the industry will be extremely visible in the API design layer. API definitions are not one of the layers where control and monetization should be applied, allowing for more creative energy to exist,  rather than being all business&mdash;monetization should occur in the API or front-end applications. Period.</p>

<p>API discovery has not changed much since 2005, when <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/30/history-of-apis--programmableweb/">John Musser launched ProgrammableWeb</a>, the API directory we've all come to know and love. In 2014 (9 years later), we have <a href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a> and a handful of other API directory and discovery tools, but we have not made progress on truly being able to discover the best APIs possible, in a distributed, machine-readable way.</p>
<p>Steve Willmott of <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, and Kin Lane of <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, are at it again, looking to provide a possible solution, that we are calling APIs.json&mdash;a machine readable listing of your APIs and supporting building blocks that lives in the root of your domain.</p>
<p>The objective of APIs.json is to help fix this problem by making it easy for people to signpost where the APIs on a given domain are and provide information on how they work. The format is simple and extensible and can be put into any web root domain for discovery.</p>
<p>We are just getting started, so make sure and get involved via the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json">Github repository </a>or via the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apisjson">Google Group</a> we've setup to facilitate discussion.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-windows.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m torn on a matter that I face when reviewing APIs for companies. I get emails from people who want me to review their API implementation, and they state they want public developers to get excited about an API, but the program isn't fully available out in the open. Most often these APIs just have some sort of landing page, which is really just a press release, and email address of someone to contact to gain access.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for people being able to have any grade of privacy for their APIs ranging from internal to completely public, but I just it difficult when API providers express interest in public developers learning about and potentially using an API, but don't provide any of the common building blocks developers are used to with a modern API. In my mind, if you are courting public developers, you should provide as much information as you possibly can, and manage access at the registration and API access levels.</p>
<p>In the end I guess I'm just exploring the best way to educate companies about the benefits of opening up, provide more information about their developer program, helping them understand that this how it is done with modern web APIs. With the right on-boarding, and API management strategy you can control who actually gets access to your API, and I can't think of why you would want to hide documentation, forums, code libraries, app showcases and other things for an API that is generally available to the public.</p>
<p>In 2014, if you are going to provide API resources to the public, you should expose as much of the developers area and as man of the supporting building block to the public as you can. At least talk through each one, and discuss the pros and cons of this being public. In a world where there are over 10K APIs available, it can be difficult to stand out, and the more public you are, the more chance developers will understand what you are offering.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m working to add yet another API example to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/what-are-some-good-examples-of-hypermedia-apis/">my growing list of hypermedia APIs in the wild</a>, I can't help but think about the long evolution of hypermedia, and how it will eventually become part of the mainstream API consciousness.</p>
<p>I first started following the often heated discussions around hypermedia a couple years ago as leading API technologists began discussing this significant evolution in API design. Hypermedia has numerous benefits and features, but one you often hear in discussions is that if we use hypermedia we can stop designing custom clients that consume APIs.</p>
<p>The logic is that if every API call comes bundled with URLs for discovering and navigating the resources that are made available via an API, clients can just use this as a blueprint for any app to API interactions. This became a fairly large argument between hypermedia architects and hypermedia haters, something that I think turned a lot of people off to the concept, forcing us to stick with many of the bad habits we already knew.</p>
<p>As I review these new hypermedia APIs, few of them are perfect by any hypermedia measurement, but they use the sensible portions of hypermedia discovery and navigation to deliver a better API experience for developers. I don't think API providers are doing it because of the perfect hypermedia vision we've heard articulated in the past, they are borrowing the pieces that make sense to them and that meet their goals.</p>
<p>Someday we may achieve a world where API clients aren't custom, with every application automatically knowing how to discover, interact, and navigate any API resource it will need. However I think in the currently reality, we will see hypermedia being adopted because it just makes sense as a next step for sensible API design, and this is how we should communicate it to curious API designers, looking to understand exactly what is this concept called hypermedia.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen a significant growth in the number of APIs in government, but to date most of these APIs are read-only, meaning you can just retrieve content or data from these APIs, not actually add, update or delete any of the resources made available via these APis.</p>
<p>I've written about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/25/a-rare-beast-in-government-the-write-api/">lack of write APIs in government before</a>, trying to kickstart the conversation amongst existing API advocates at various agencies, and <a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/write_apis-notes.html">now 18F, the elite tech group at the GSA is doing the same</a>. 18F has a page dedicated to the conversation around write APIs in government, with eight active examples of write APIs, nine potential examples, and two that are "under consideration".</p>
<p>What 18F is doing, is a key part of the process that will demonstrate to existing API owners at government agencies, that write APIs are possible, by showcasing the existing implementations, as well as others that are under development. Agencies need clear examples to follow, reassuring them that this is possible in government, giving them potential mentors, and in some cases incentivize agencies by making them feel they are behind the curve, and missing out on opportunities to lead when serving their constituents.</p>
<p>The importance thate government agencies have read / write APIs goes beyond the obvious benefits around content and data being more complete and up to date--a two way street, when it comes to API operations requires a more dedicated approach, bringing agencies closer to both private and public sector partners who will be consuming and contributing to the API(s). This process reduces the chance an API will be launched and forgotten about, which really does nobody any good, and contributes to giving APIs in government a bad name.</p>
<p>If you work at a federal agency, or are a contractor working on APIs within government, make sure and <a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/write_apis-notes.html">reach out to 18F</a> and see how you can be part of this significant change in how federal government operates. For all of this API stuff to work, APIs in government must be a two way street.</p>

<p>API <a href="https://zapier.com">interoperability and reciprocity provider Zapier</a> is looking to get everyone up to speed on the world of APIs, by providing an <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/apis/">introduction to APIs</a> that is meant for both developers who are new to APIs, and easy enough for non-developers to follow.</p>
<p>To help get people up to speed on APIs, Zapier&rsquo;s introduction has eight chapters covering the big picture:</p>

<li>Chapter 6: API Design</li>
<li>Chapter 7: Real-Time Communication</li>

<p>It is good to see providers like Zapier develop an introductory course for people to learn about APIs. It is in Zapier&rsquo;s interest to help get people up to speed&mdash;the more folks who understand that APIs exist, the more chance they will use Zapier as the platform they depend on to orchestrate their lives in the cloud.</p>
<p>Zapier&rsquo;s move reflects my original vision behind API Evangelist, and my belief that everyone should understand APIs, and I mean everyone! <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/17/api-and-oauth-literacy-is-as-important-as-financial-literacy-in-the-api-economy/">Much like personal finance, not everyone needs to understand the inner workings of APIs, but every individual should understand they exist</a>, and how they can use services like Zapier to take control of our digital self.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/oauth-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I attended a two day API specification session between major California utilities, <a href="https://www.sce.com">Southern California Edison</a> (SCE), <a href="http://www.sdge.com/">San Diego Gas &amp; Electric</a> (SDG&amp;E), and <a href="http://www.pge.com/">Pacific Gas and Electric</a> (PG&amp;E), that was organized by Hypertek Inc. for <a href="http://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST), that is looking to push forward the <a href="http://www.greenbuttondata.org/">Green Button data</a> and API agenda of the White House and Department of Energy.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://energyos.github.io/OpenESPI-GreenButton-API-Documentation/">Green Button API and open data model already exists</a>, but the current hurdle for the initiative is to get leading utilities to agree to specific implementation definitions that serve their customers, so it can be ratified as a standard. This entire two day session was dedicated to walking through line by line, and establish the oAuth scope that each of the three utility companies would implementing when providing Green Button data via the API to 3rd party developers, who are building solutions for utility customers.</p>
<p>An example of this in the wild, would be if a utility customer wanted to get a quote for a rooftop solar installation, the installer could use a software solution that was developed by a 3rd party vendor, that pulls that customers energy usage via the Green Button API, and generate a precise quote for the number of solar panels they&rsquo;d need to cover their energy usage. Now this is just one example of how energy data could be used, but a very powerful and relevant one in 2014, that give customers access and control over their data.</p>
<p>Before we even get there, the Green Button API definition, data model, and oAuth scope has to be finalized with utility providers, before it can be submitted as a standard&mdash;with the final oAuth scope being what will be agreed to by each 3rd party developer that integrates with each utility's Green Button API. This oAuth scope sets the tone for the conversation that 3rd party software providers, and vendors can ultimately have with utility customers around their private utility data.</p>
<p>In my opinion this is one potential model for how industry operations will be negotiated in the future. While not all API definitions, data models and oAuth scopes will be defined by the government then negotiated with industries, but oAuth will be where this scope is negotiated between industry leaders and governments, no matter which side leads the conversation. Governments and industries working together to define API standards is nothing new, but what is new, is the presence of the oAuth layer which gives end-users, and citizens an active role. 3rd party developers and end-users do not get a place in the negotiations, but they do when it comes to putting valuable industry data to use in new ways--or not, which will flow back upstream and influence future iterations of APIs, data models and oAuth scope.</p>
<p>This introduction of the oAuth layer in how industries operate, potentially coupled with the access and innovation that can occur via API platforms when they are executed in alignment with modern API implementations, will change how industries grow and ultimately how power flows (pun intended). This evolution in how the public and private sector partner will not always positive by default, I&rsquo;m not an API solutionist in that I believe APIs bless everything as good, but with the right players at the table, a little sunlight and transparency in the process, and a feedback loop that includes 3rd party developers and end-users, we might be able to implement meaningful change across many different industries around the globe.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-handshake.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>There is a laundry list of problems with the current state of terms of service, affectionality called TOS--those legal documents we all agree to as part of our usage of online services, and are defining relationships between API providers and their consumers. API Voice is dedicated to exploring this, and other building blocks that make up the politics of APIs, an area you will see increased coverage of in 2014.</p>
<p>As I continue to develop a better understanding of how API terms of service influence the API economy, I can't help but think one of the fundamental flaws of API terms of use is that there is no room for negotiation. Earlier this month I <a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/01/would-you-pay-for-alternate-options-for-an-api-terms-of-service/">explored the concept of being able to pay for alternate options within a terms of service</a>, as part of my ongoing journey towards a machine readable TOS.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that to fully realize the API economy as many of us technologists see it, the terms of service have to be machine readable, allowing for seamless integration into the other political building blocks like privacy policies, service level agreements, partner access tiers, and pricing. If you think about it, current API terms of service reflect the command and control governance style of SOA, not the flexible, agile and innovative approach that APIs are often known for.</p>
<p>Why aren't API terms of service negotiable? Well they are, it just isn't built into the existing API platform. Many API ecosystem allow for circumventing and negotiating at the terms of service level behind closed doors, with partners, and API consumers who share the same investors, it just isn't a conversation that occurs out in the open. This approach reflects legacy ways of doing business, where if you are in the know, have the right connections, you can negotiate, and not the new API driven approach that will allow the API economy to scale as required.</p>
<p>The ability for API consumers to negotiate the terms of service isn't something that we can just roll out overnight, it is something we have to evolve towards over time. I&rsquo;m hoping to help facilitate this evolution, through brainstorming, stories and conversations around the potential of machine readable terms of service, here on API Voice over the next couple of years.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 May 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Gluecon/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-gluecon/gluecon.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The time has come for one of my favorite events in the tech space&mdash;<a href="http://www.gluecon.com/2014/">Gluecon</a>. If you have never been to Gluecon or Defrag, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/11/how-to-defrag-your-brain-and-tech-career-in-november/">read some of my previous posts about just how different the event is</a>. Gluecon has brought together tech leaders, who have helped define the API space for the last six years, to a small resort in Colorado, creating an environment for conversation I have not experienced anywhere else.</p>
<p>This year Gluecon is exceptionally special for me, because 3Scale and API Evangelist are doing a special first day of un-workshop discussions on API design and the Internet of Things and Realtime, continuing the <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> conversation. You can find all the <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Gluecon/">details over at the APIStrat site,</a> and even register and be part of the conversation.</p>
<p>The topic of API design has dominated my blog traffic, with every story I do on the subject filling the top 10 most visited posts for the last 3 months. The conversation of how to design APIs has exploded, with the introduction of languages and tooling from Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML, and as we realize that API design is more art than science&mdash;something that developers and business leaders should all be part of. The first Gluecon / APIStrat un-workshop is dedicated to this fast growing area of the API sector.</p>
<p>In 2014 you can&rsquo;t have a conversation about APIs without discussing the next wave of Internet enabled devices&mdash;dubbed Internet of Things (Iot). We are seeing a new breed of APIs, and frameworks emerge that don&rsquo;t just connect devices to the Internet, but also facilitate realtime communications between devices and the cloud&mdash;merging realtime and Iot.  The second Gluecon / APIStrat un-workshop is bringing together a wide range of practitioners to discuss what is next for APIs in the context of realtime IoT.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t too late to get your tickets to Gluecon and <a href="http://apistrategyconference.com/2014Gluecon/">register for the APIStrat un-workshops</a>. Tickets to Denver are pretty inexpensive from most places in the country, even at this late date. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the conversations that I&rsquo;ll have at Gluecon, both in the sessions, the hallway in-between, and the taproom late into the night--I will see you there!</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 May 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/moc-2014/2014-moc-management-of-change.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was invited to <a href="https://actiac.org/MOC2014">moderate a workshop panel in Maryland next week at the The American Council for Technology (ACT) - Industry Advisory Council (IAC) Management of Change 2014 event</a>. If you arenat familiar with ACT-IAC, they are a non-profit, public-private partnership dedicated to improving government through the application of information technology--with the event bringing government leaders together, and discussing open data, open source, and APIs.</p>
<p>The workshop is described as:</p>
<blockquote><em>Open Data isn&rsquo;t just data sets. It&rsquo;s APIs, it&rsquo;s open source and, most importantly &mdash; it&rsquo;s people. Working within these new concepts and methods requires a change in culture by our programs, executives, and contracting offices. In order to execute on providing open source to the public, we need new skills for the workforce that let us contract appropriately, and learn how to design our systems from the ground up with APIs and open source in mind.</em></blockquote>
<p>I will be leading the discussion between a panel of  X subject matter experts:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Kevin Youel-Page</strong> - Assistant Commissioner, Integrated Award Environment, General Services Administration</li>
<li><strong>Dan Gahafer</strong> - Forge.mil Program Manager, Defense Information Systems Agency</li>
<li><strong>Leigh Heyman</strong> - Director of New Media Technologies, the White House</li>
<li><strong>Dan Lockney</strong> &ndash; Technology Transfer Program Executive, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration</li>
<li><strong>Pamela Wise-Martinez</strong> - Senior Strategic Enterprise Architect, Office of the Director of National Intelligence</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m honored to have been invited to help lead the discussion, which is in alignment with my mission to bring awareness of the power of APIs amongst government leaders. I&rsquo;m looking forward to what I, and the rest of the event, can learn from these government leaders regarding how they are using open data, open source software, and APIs to effect change within their agencies.</p>
<p>The fact that we are having conversations like this at the highest levels of government in 2014, after four years of API evangelism, makes me hopeful that we are making progress, in not just changing how we do business, or how the government operates, but also how the private and public sector both work together in the emerging API economy.</p>
