In my [Google Reader][1] I curate hundreds of articles pulled from 600 blogs and 25 real-time Google Alerts, on a daily basis. Everything I star in my Google Reader or Tweet about daily ends up in my [Pinboard][2] account. In addition to this curation, I bookmark every relevant site and post I come across in my daily surfing using the Pinboard bookmarklet.

Using the [Pinboard API][3] I setup a news curation system at [API Evangelist][4] which pulls my latest pinboards every 15 minutes and adds them to a curation queue which I monitor every couple hours. My API Evangelist curation system allows me to add comments and tags, further adding meaning to what I’ve already read throughout the day. Then using a combinations of tags, I route relevant news to  [API Evangelist][5] and [Hack Weekends][6].

These curated links represent the daily reading and research that goes into my writing and industry reports. I thought it would be good to share with you some of what I read on a daily basis, my random comments and insights, rather than just the final results.
