        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/11/29/government-services-schemas-with-jsonld/">Government Services Schemas With JSON-LD</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15p;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p><span>This fall while working in Washington D.C. I was introduced to the concept of</span><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/government-services/RepresentingGovernmentServiceswithJSON-LD.pdf">representing government services with JSON-LD</a><span>. Using the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/CivicServices">civic services schema.org</a><span>&nbsp;proposal you can represent common government services that target indvidiuals and businesses, providing a standard that developers can use when presenting government services in websites and mobile applications.</span></p>
<p>I was working on a project to help publish services from the Department of Veterans Affairs, and I wanted to enable people who work at the VA, as well as other agencies to be able to generate and manage JSON-LD representations of their services in the easiest way possible. So I thought to myself, what is the number one way for people in government to manage data? Spreadsheets of course!</p>
<p>I decided to start with Google Docs, and generate a simple JavaScript tool to take a Google Spreadsheet template that was setup with the required fields for a government services schema. Next I wrote an import script using Tabletop.js that would grab the contents of the Google Spreadsheet template and using JavaScript to generate the JSON-LD.</p>
<p>This thanksgiving holiday I decided to add one more tool to my work with government services and JSON-LD, and build a form that anyone could fill out and generate their own government services JSON-LD. The result is a Bootstrap, JQuery form that you can fill out, then hit publish JSON and using JavaScript it generates the JSON-LD representation for you.</p>
<p>I started a <a href="http://government.services.publicprivatesector.org/index.html">project to organize my work around government services</a> and published the <a title="Google Spreadsheet to JSON-LD" href="http://government.services.publicprivatesector.org/google-doc.html">Google Spreadsheet to JSON-LD</a> and the <a title="form to JSON-LD generators" href="http://government.services.publicprivatesector.org/form.html">form to JSON-LD generators</a>. Next I will be adding the ability to save generated files to the Github master repository, making the whole thing a formable, government JSON-LD generator and storage repo.</p>
<p>I'm enjoying developing forms that generate JSON lately. I built an <a href="http://apicommons.org/manifest-generator.html">API Commons manifest generator</a> the other night, and using the same momentum I developed the government services JSON-LD generator. I couldn't think of a more worthy project to spend my time on over Thanksgiving. Hopefully government agencies of all shapes and sizes can more easily generate and publish machine readable lists of the valuable services they offer, so that Google, Yahoo, Bing and other web or mobile app developer can more easily and accurately represent these services in their apps.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/11/25/early-thoughts-on-robotsjson/">Early Thoughts on Robots.json</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">25 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-robot-json.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>My friend <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>, Director of Platform for the <a href="http://developer.klout.com/">Klout API</a>, wrote up a great piece before <a title="#APIStrat" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">#APIStrat</a>, called <a href="https://medium.com/p/4d36eab870c9">A Short Proposal for Robots.json</a>.</p>
<p>This is a topic that I've been meaning to make time to discuss, but only now finding time. I love exchanging ideas with <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>, because we tend to disagree on some important API related topics, however he is extremely knowledgeable on the space, and like me he possesses some strong opinions and is very open to lively discussion via blogs, twitter and on stage at events.</p>
<p>On the topics of web scraping, API rate limits, and API access that exist in the realm of what I call the politics of APIs, <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> and I couldn't disagree more on what is acceptable use in the API economy. What is interesting though, within this disagreement we find affinity in the topic of the robots.json.</p>
<p><a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a>&nbsp;has a very succinct description of what a robots.json file would be:</p>
<blockquote><em>A Robots.json file, or something like it, would contain all desired rules for retention, caching, access control, license rights, chain of custody, business models and other use cases allowed and encouraged for developers.</em></blockquote>
<p>I think a machine readable file that provides access to all aspects of an APIs terms of use is a great idea. Beyond the obvious benefits of publishing a robots.json file for API providers and consumers, I think the practice would help standardize industry best practices for API terms and conditions. In my experience most API providers just emulate what they see in the space and if top players lead on this subject, others will follow.</p>
<p><a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> and I both agree that there should be a robots.json, however we come at it from two opposing viewpoints. <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> is coming at from an API vendor  position, and I'm coming at from the stance of an API consumer. <a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> wants to establish a definition of where the provider stands, setting the "rules of the road" as Twitter would say--where I want a single location to find the same definition, so that as an API consumer I can understand the "rules of engagement", and decide if I want to even waste my time, based upon their stance.</p>
<p>With a standardized robots.json, as a developer I could very easily set the bar for which API providers I integrate into my applications. If a company's views on "retention, caching, access control, license rights, chain of custody and business models" are not in alignment with my businesses, I can easily determine this without spending any time learning about their API--something that can be very costly and time consuming.</p>
<p><a title="@harmophone" href="https://twitter.com/harmophone">@harmophone</a> uses Craigslists as the lead in for what a possible robots.json file could be used for, and the tone that it could set. While the tone of Craiglist's robots.json file might be very stern, setting what I would consider to be a very uninformed, "get off my lawn" vibe, I don't think all robots.json would reflect this tone.</p>
<p>Forward thinking companies could use a robots.json to easily differentiate themselves from outdated viewpoints on what "retention, caching, access control, license rights, chain of custody and business models" means, allowing developers to quickly identify leading players, and through "markets" set what is the prevailing definition is for the current times.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://asuc.org/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/universities/uc-berkeley/associated-student-university-california-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>On November 6th, 2013 the <a title="ASUC" href="http://asuc.org/">Associated Students, University of California(ASUC) Senate</a> submitted SB 48: <a href="http://asuc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Week-10-Agenda-Packet-11.6.131.pdf">A Bill in Support of Student Information Systems Application Developers</a>, stating that "open data and API compatibility is a necessary feature in the new Student Information System".</p>
<p>UC Berkeley has embarked on a "Student Information System Replacement Project" that is looking to "replace its constellation of aging, unique, disparate home-grown student systems with a modern, nimble and effective vendor-supported system".  Systems including financial aid, registration, enrollment, admissions and records are being targeted for replacement.</p>
<p>The existing Student Information Systems(SIS) has been in place for over two decades, and facing the same for future systems, the students led organization that represents over 35K students, is taking a stance to ensure that all future systems have APIs. That is some serious forethought and leadership on behalf on the ASUC Senate!</p>
<p>SB 48 puts forth that:</p>
<blockquote><em>an API, or Application Programming Interface, is a foundation put in place on top of a system to securely make specific information and data public to developers for those developers to create third-party extensions and applications pertaining to their specific uses for the data and program</em></blockquote>
<p>API and Integration Architect of UC Berkeley, George Atala(<a href="https://twitter.com/gmatala">@gmatala</a>) adds:</p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;An SIS API would be critical for supporting the many user applications and other campus systems that serve students. These systems change and evolve continuously, and a real time read/write API is necessary to enable this. The API must cover the full range of core functionality in the SIS, and should support appropriate levels of security for private and public data.&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>The bill authored by Sahil A Pandya and Quinn Z Shen nails some of the critical areas around APIs being a vital aspect of university operations, and that much of the SIS overhaul will not happen all at once, when in reality the evolution of all campus systems should happen in smaller, bite-size chunks. APIs would help evolve campus information systems from a 20-30 years technology procurement cycle, to a real-time, ongoing, agile systems lifecycle.</p>
<p>Current SIS are operating without APIs, limiting which applications can be integrated and deployed on top of university systems. Even with this current closed approach, there are a handful of student-made applications such as <a title="BerkelyTime" href="/admin/blog/berkeleytime.com">BerkeleyTime</a> and <a href="/admin/blog/ninjacourses.com">NinjaCourses</a>&nbsp;that have emerged showing the demand for better quality SIS applications and tools.</p>
<p>These existing, student-developed applications often obtain their information by scraping publicly available information on the Internet. APIs would provide direct access to information, eliminate scraping load on public websites, and provide analytics and insight into what applications exist, and how they use university and student information.  APIs provide higher level of control and security for UC IT operations, than even the currently closed systems offer. UC Berkeley uses <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API infrastructure</a> to manage acess, analytics and other vital aspects of their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/25/get-a-list-of-all-classes-at-uc-berkeley-with-api-call/">recently launch API operations</a>, but unfortunately is not fullly taken advantage of across all university systems..</p>
<p>In addition to current student-developed applications, there are also other faculty-developed extensions to SIS that apply to specific departments, but are not covered by central information systems. All of these student, faculty and third party applications have proven to be so beneficial to students in serving purposes, that many of them have been officially adopted and endorsed by the University.</p>
<p>Imagine a university where each entering student experiences the financial aid, enrollment and registration process, then one of their first opportunities to learn involves actually contributed to building applications and tools that make that process better. In a world where university resources are increasingly strained, the institutions that remain relevant will allow for student, faculty and third party access to all campus resources via APIs.</p>
<p>I think SB 48 nails it again with?</p>
<blockquote><em>"the university with the top computer science department should also have the top student information system in place and harness the talent in its students by allowing them to create applications that enhance and extend features in the information system (i.e. the mantra 'Created by students, for students')"</em></blockquote>
<p>Wait! Information systems created by students for students? What if businesses students could help with data analysis and reporting? What if marketing students could help build interactive campaigns? Sounds like the recipe for some interesting education and work experience for students, and a huge opportunity for the university system to maximize the valuable intellectual exhaust generated by its faculty and students eacUh day.</p>
<p>I have to go out with the last section of SB 48, I think it speaks for itself:</p>
<blockquote><em>"THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Associated Students of the University of California stand in solidarity with student, faculty, and administrative developers under the unified opinion that open data and API compatibility is a necessary feature in the new Student Information System to ensure its longevity and holistic usefulness to students, not only in its core features, but in the potential add-ons from third-party applications and extensions"</em></blockquote>

        <span class="post-date">21 Nov 2013</span>

<p>I'm working on an <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/index.html">API for Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form</a>. I'm working my way through a document from Department of Education called the <a href="http://www.ifap.ed.gov/appprocspecsswd/1314AppProcSysSoftwareDevSpecsAugust2013Update.html">2013-2014 Application Processing System Specifications for Software Developers</a>.</p>
<p>I'm isolating various datasets, and data models, trying to get a feel for all the API resources I will need for the FAFSA API. The specifications provides several tables of data and data models for me to use, including the actual fields for the FAFSA form.</p>
<p>One dataset that is provided in the PDF is a list of states. It makes sense that a list of states is included for any developer who is building a federal student aid application. And I have a states API available elsewhere, that I've used in several other applications, so building this API will for the project will be easy.</p>
<p>Next I'm thinking..how do I replicate this utility API easily for an external API project like this? One of the architectural considerations for the FAFSA API is to make an API that anyone could fork and easily setup for their own use. That includes the state API resource.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about APIs in general. When it comes to APIs, they are ften attached to brands, like the Twilio API or Twitter API. We do not think of single API definitions as ubiquitous, as utilities or as commodities yet. However there are a lot of common API resources like states, IP addresses, counties, cities and many more, that are essential to many web and mobile applications.</p>
<p>Sure these datasets are widely available, but you need to actually design and deploy the actual API. How do we make utility APIs like this deployable anywhere? Anytime? I should be able to select from a library of common API definitions and easily fork, then deploy to my AWS EC2, AWS Cloud Formation or OpenShift platform. I shouldn't have to rely on 3rd party services for all of these resources.</p>
<p>Of course, not all APIs should be this portable, but there are a number of very common APIs that could. I should be able to launch a new API portal for a public audience or even a private development group, and easily publish the unique, as well as the utility APIs they will need to be successful, in a single, easy to navigate API area.</p>

<p>I was asked to help put some thought into an API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid iniative. First, what is FAFSA:</p>
<blockquote>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the form the U.S. Department of Education (ED) requires to determine your Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The government conducts a &ldquo;need analysis&rdquo; based on financial information, such as income, assets, and other family information, which you (and your parents if you are a dependent student) will be asked to provide.</blockquote>
<p>I'm just getting started with this project, and as I do with all my Public / Private Sector work, I created <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/index.html">this umbrella site for my Department of Education open data and API work</a>, and created an individual project site just for the <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/index.html">Free Application for Federal Student Aid API</a>.</p>
<p>You can participate in the design and development process via the <a href="https://github.com/ed-data">Gitihub repositories</a>, and feel free to ping me @kinlane if you want to get involved. I will post stories here, and on the individual site to chronical its progress, and reference on API Evangelist when applicable.</p>
<p>Next up, understanding what the details of the FAFSA form are, and start considering what some possible architectural designs might work for FAFSA...</p>

        <p><a href="http://gitspatial.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/gitspatial/git-spatial-2.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I've been pushing the boundaries of open data and API deployment using Github. I have a project I've been evolving since August called <a title="Simple API" href="http://simple-api.github.io/central/">Simple API</a> and its sister implementation <a title="api.ongithub.com" href="http://api.ongithub.com">api.ongithub.com</a>, which allows you to launch an API by forking common API definitions that are hosted on Github.</p>
<p>I was recently introduced to similar approach to geospatial API deployment using GeoJSON stored on Github called <a href="http://gitspatial.com/" target="_blank">GitSpatial</a>. Using the same approach, GitSpatial lets allows you to oAuth into the API deployment platform using your Github login, then spiders your repositories and let's you sync the repositories that contain GeoJSON.</p>
<p>Then using three URL parameters:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>user_name</strong> - Your GitHub user name</li>
<li><strong>repo_name</strong> - A GitHub repo name</li>
<li><strong>feature_set_name</strong> - A file in your repo that contains GeoJSON</li>
</ul>
<p>GitSpatial allows you to construct a geo spatial API resource URI: <strong><em>http://gitspatial.com/:user_name/:repo_name/:feature_set_name</em></strong></p>
<p>Pretty cool stuff! I might be a little biased here, but I think this type of API deployment via Github blueprints, plus JSON data stores is going to be big. I've been experimenting with <a title="API deployments from Github blueprints via Amazon Cloud Formations and Redhat OpenShift" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/20/server-side-api-templates-on-aws-cloud-formation-and-openshift/">API deployments from Github blueprints via Amazon Cloud Formations and Redhat OpenShift</a>, and it seems like the next evolution in cloud driven API deployment to me.</p>
<p>The best part to this approach is that your data, configurations and core elements are maintained within your world as simple, open formats like JSON--then you get to externally connect, using Github, to premium API services that augment and enhance your existing resources.</p>
<p>Lookout for an increase in the number of Github + API solutions in the coming months...</p>

<p>I created <a href="http://apicommons.org/apis.html">11 very simple API designs</a> for the launch of <a href="http://apicommons.org/">API Commons</a>. We needed some API definitions to show the potential of the commons, so I wanted to design a handful of common API patterns to seed the launch.</p>
<p>For all 11 API designs I started with a <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki">Swagger definition</a>, then using PHP and the Slim framework I quickly generated server side code for each API. I generate this code programmatically from the Swagger spec, but I also prefer going through the generated code and giving it a human touch.</p>
<p>This approach isn't just for these 11 API design templates, I'm using it for all my projects right now. I'm designing the API definition, generating and modifying the server side code, publishing Swagger UI documentation, then any client side code libraries I will need.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openshift.com/"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/openshift/openshift-logo.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm publishing the API definition and Swagger UI, plus a project overview completely on Github. Currently I'm generating PHP / Slim framework driven code on AWS EC2 instance. I'm will expand this to include server side frameworks in Ruby, Python, Node.JS.</p>
<p>Next I will take each API definition + server-side code in PHP, Ruby, Python and Node.js and running on Amazon EC2 and port to run in <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS Cloud Formation</a> and <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift</a> from RedHat--providing an open API blueprint that others can deploy in the cloud.</p>
<p>This will be my basic process for any standard API design I'm evolving for <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, APIs I develop internally, as well any API that I design, develop and build for external projects.  As with my stories and open data, I want any API I design to be open and reusable by anyone who is in need of the same API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/appstream/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/appstream/amazon-appstream-main.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>With the growing number of hypermedia API deployments, hypermedia haters&copy; are going to lose a major argument, that hypermedia is just an academic exercise and will never work in the wild. ;-)</p>
<p>The latest hypermedia API I was told about&nbsp;in the wild(thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>), is from Amazon Web Services with the recent <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream/latest/developerguide/rest-api.html#rest-api-hal">AppStream API</a>--"a flexible, low-latency service that lets you stream resource intensive applications and games from the cloud".</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream/latest/developerguide/rest-api.html#rest-api-hal">The AWS AppStream API</a> is an API that uses <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">Hypertext Application Language</a> (HAL),  a consistent and easy way to hyperlink between API resources, created by Mike Kelly(<a href="https://twitter.com/mikekelly85">@mikekelly85</a>) of <a href="http://stateless.co/">Stateless.co</a>. When HAL is used, with each API request, you get a  wealth of links that allow you to programmatically explore the functionality of an API.</p>
<p>For example, you can explore the JSON returned in each response from the application API endpoint, about a specific app you are streaming including using the services, you will find links to determine application status, show information on current session and many more.</p>
<p>Normally with APIs, developers have to explore each API endpoint, and read through documentation to understand the different actions that can be taken against an API. With HAL, API owners can craft links that provide meaningful actions that can be discovered and implemented by developers along the way, teaching them about what is possible with each API call.</p>
<p>Hypermedia goes a long way in extending business rules to developers, not just directing them to what next steps may be taken at each API request, but really save them a lot of homework on how your API business model works, and how to best build an application around an API.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">other hypermedia APIs</a> in the wild, including the very important <a href="http://publicmediaplatform.org/">Public Media Platform (PMP)</a>, but the numbers are still low. I will keep finding quality hypermedia solutions in the wild and sharing them with you as I find.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apache-solr/apache-solr-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was going through the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/#search-endpoint">Free Law Project Court Opinion API</a> today, playing with the API and data, while developing some server and client side tooling.  All the API endpoints are pretty consistence because they used their Django model and the <a href="http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Tastypie framework</a> to generate most of the API.</p>
<p>There is one endpoint that is radically different from the rest of the opinion API: the /search endpoint. The Free Law Project used <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a> to generate the /search endpoint results and instead of directly hitting just the database for information it utilized Solr index to do the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>Using Solr opens up a whole world of search by introducing common concepts like AND, OR, NOT, fielded queries, wildcards, fuzzy searches and much more when it comes to searching for court opinions.</p>
<p>While the on-boarding of Solr newbies to an endpoint like this takes some education, and the opinion API /search endpoint docs could use a little more polishing to  make it easier to start using, but the concept of a Solr driven endpoint is still very interesting.</p>
<p>Using Solr like this might not work for all API providers, but for some who are heavily using data stores that include document repositories as well, it might be a good idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While <a title="Have A Bunch Of Documents? Launch An API With Apache Solr" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/08/13/have-a-bunch-of-documents-launch-an-api-with-apache-solr/">I have advocated for using Solr to generate an API before</a>, this is the first time I've seen it bundled alongside another API offering so seamlessly, just to drive the search endoint.  I'll be keeping an eye out for others during my regular monitoring.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/">Court Listener Opinions API</a> is a well designed, dead simple REST API with 7 endpoints to search opinions, citations across jurisdictions, using Basic Auth to secure the API.</p>
<p>Along with the simple API and docs, the Court Listener provides a blog and forum to support developers, and <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk-info/">bulk downloads of all data</a> in addition to the REST API.</p>
<p>The court opinions API implementation is a model to follow for other public sector open data and API projects. The API and supporting developer area is simple and very well done, providing all the essential building blocks needed to grow an ecosystem around the API and data.</p>
<p>The entire API and data is released in the  public domain, and relies on donations to do the work and keep the lights on--something that should be the bar set for all public data projects.</p>
<p>This external, open approach to liberating, aggregating and improving on vital public sector data, is a model we need to replicate across all areas of city, county, state and federal government in all sectors.</p>

The piece that I'm tracking on specifically right now is around the <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/policy-memo">OMB Memorandum M-13-13</a> Open Data Policy-Managing Information as an Asset, in which one of the items require agencies to publish a data.json file that provides a machine readable inventory of each agencies public data assets.</p>

A handful of agencies already have their data.json file up, others show a green check, but in reality their HTTP status codes are incorrect, as <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/11/06/knowing-your-http-status-codes-in-federal-government/">I've talked about before</a>.</p>
<p>I'll re-run this script nightly and keep an eye on which agencies publish their data.json and highlight what types of data sets they've made available. I think in reality, the challenges faced in taking inventory of open data, getting them published will prevent many agencies from making the deadline. Something that was just made worse by the government shutdown in October.</p>
<p>Even with these challenges, I'm hopeful that agencies will surprise us and publish some amazing stuff.</p>

<p>Dyn has 500 managed DNS users and partners using their APIs, growing from 7.3 million monthly API requests in January 2012 to 38.1 million API requests in September 2013, that is a 420% growth over 20 months.</p>

<p>I'm totally thankful for the experiences I've had over the last 90 days in Washington D.C. as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, and even more thankful I'm able to keep doing much of the work I was doing during my fellowship. In reality, I'm actually doing more work now, than I was in DC.</p>
<p>While there were several challenges during my time as a PIF, the one that I regret the most, and is taking the longest to recover from, is losing my storytelling voice. This is my ability to capture everyday thoughts in real-time via my Evernote, sit down and form these thoughts into stories, and then share these stories publicly as the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>During my time in DC, I was steadily losing my voice. It wasn't some sort of government conspiracy. It is something that seems to happen to me in many institutional or corporate settings, amidst the busy schedule, back to back meetings and through a more hectic project schedule--eventually my voice&nbsp;begins to fade.</p>
<p>In July I wrote 61 blog posts, August 41 and September 21. A very scary trend for me. My blog is more than just just stories for my audience and page views generated. My blog(s) are about me working through ideas and preparing them for public consumption.</p>
<p>Without storytelling via my blog(s) I don't fully process ideas, think them through, flush them out and think about the API space with a critical eye. Without this lifecycle I don't evolve in my career, and maintain my perspective on the space.</p>
<p>In October I've written 28 posts and so far in November I've already written 27 posts, so I'm on the mend. In the future, I'm using my voice as a canary in the coal mine. If a project I'm working on is beginning to diminish my voice, I need to stop and take a look at things, and make sure I'm not heading in a negative direction.</p>

<p>Sometimes no matter how hard you try, you can't get the buy in for APIs within a company or organization. There are many reasons why API efforts will fail within entrenched companies, organizations or government agencies, but in the end you may have to look for alternatives.</p>
<p>If you want to fullfill your API vision, many times you will need to go outside normal operations to get things done. I have multiple projects on my plate right now that have been started as internal projects, but after hitting roadblock after roadblock, key players have approached me to consider doing as an outside project.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to get people interested in APIs, is to get everyone around them talking about APIs or even getting key partners to adopt an API driven approach to a problem. If you can get traction for an API design externally, you may be able to change attitudes.</p>
<p>APIs are about opening up resources for access and use. If you can't get an API designed, developed and deployed internally, consider maybe doing it from the outside-in.</p>

<p>While API Commons is about providing a place to house these very technical design specifications, the largest benefit of API commons will be the process  , community and culture that will form around it. Bringing API design across government and industries out into the open, focusing on sharing, collaboration, reuse and operability will be the true end product--not just the tangible API definition.</p>
<p>As I work on a handful of new API designs for various projects, that I plan on putting in the commons when ready, the importance of API Commons becomes ever clearer. While the end goal appears to be populating the commons with API designs, the real work is about bringing everyone out of the shadows, working on their API designs in a collaborative, re-usable way.</p>

<p>I'm doing a lot more API deployments from dead simple data sources since I started working in the federal government. As part of these efforts I'm working to put together a simple toolkit that newbies to the API world can use to rapidly deploy APIs as well.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I worked through the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/api-deployment-from-mysql-json-github-and-google-spreadsheets/">simple, open API implementations</a>, and this week <span>I want to show how to secure access to the API by requiring an AppID and AppKey which will allow you to track on who has access to the API.</span></p>
<p>I'm using <a href="http://bit.ly/1cHBhd5">3Scale API Management</a> infrastructure to secure the demos. 3Scale has a free base offering that allows anyone to get up and running requiring API keys, analytics and other essentials with very little investment.</p>
<p>Currently I have four separate deployment blueprints done:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/deploy-secure-api-mysql-to-api/">MySQL to API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/deploy-secure-api-json-to-api/">Local JSON to API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/deploy-secure-api-public-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">Public Google Spreadsheet to API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/deploy-secure-api-private-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">Private Google Spreadsheet to API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these samples are in PHP and uses the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim PHP REST framework</a>. They are meant to be working examples that you can use to seed your own API deployment.</p>
<p>You can find the entire <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-deploy-toolkit">working repository</a>, including Slim framework at Github.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.openshift.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/openshift/openshift-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm working on a variety of ways that anyone can easily deploy API on common cloud platforms. I'm working through a series of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/api-deployment-from-mysql-json-github-and-google-spreadsheets/">open</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/secure-api-deployment-from-mysql-json-github-and-google-spreadsheets/">secure</a>, modular API demos written in PHP, using the Slim framework.</p>
<p>All of these demos are pretty basic, but currently I'm deploying them on Amazon EC2, because it is where most of my infrastructure runs and a top platform with wide user base. Ultimately my goal is to make them as simple to deploy as I possibly can, and while EC2 is definitely the leader, I know there are even simpler ways to launch simple APIs in the clouds.</p>
<p>I was doing a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/us-government-apis/1zVJwxQfyBw">survey of which PaaS platforms government agencies allow their workers to deploy projects on</a>, via the US government API group and was reminded of <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift</a>, from Redhat. If you aren't familiar with OpenShift, it is a PaaS platform that allows you to define applications in a variety of languages, then deploy, automate, manage and scale in a very modular way.</p>
<p>With OpenShift I can define a very modular application, such as an API running PHP, using Slim framework and even apply what is known as a database cartridge, providing MySQL or Postgres storage for the API--all with a single command line.  I can instruct each application to derive its code from a Git location, allowing me to manage a central library of applications, then deploy specific instances as needed.</p>
<p>While I'm heavily using Github as the primary place to deploy <a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/">single page applications</a>, that are completely written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON, I still need server side locations to rapidly deploy API driven resources in PHP, Python, Ruby and Node.  OpenShift is a much more modular approach that AWS, and while I'll still be using Amazon for many of my deployments I'm going to play around more with what is possible on OpenShift.</p>
<p>What I really like about this approach, in addition to the modular design is that I can maintain blueprints for common APIs on Github and reference these designs when deploying APIs via OpenShift. This matches up well with what I'm doing with <a title="api.ongithub.com " href="http://api.ongithub.com">api.ongithub.com</a> and <a title="data.ongithub.com" href="http://data.ongithub.com">data.ongithub.com</a> where I working to define simple Git driven approaches to open data and APIs.</p>
<p>Good stuff, I look forward to playing around more.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/introducing-data-ongithub/">Introducing Data Ongithub</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://data.ongithub.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/github/github-matrix.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am a big fan of opening up data in city, county, state and federal government and across companies of all shapes and sizes. One thing I've learned in my 20+ years of working with data is that when it comes to data management, the spreadsheet is king. While there are always centralized database systems at companies and government organizations, the spreadsheet is actually how data is generally managed, shared and distributed by the average person.</p>
<p><a href="http://data.ongithub.com">Data Ongithub</a> is a project that is focused on tapping the wealth of data available in spreadsheet form and provide a simple platform for converting and managing open data, that anyone can use. While working on open data initiatives I consistently see two major hurdles for individuals who are opening up data:</p>
<blockquote><strong>How Do I Convert My Data To JSON?</strong> JSON is the reigning open data format. It is a light-weight, portable, machine readable format and is the preferred format of programmers over CSV or XML. Even with this popularity there is no common way for individuals to easily convert common data formats like Excel, CSV or XML to JSON without being a programmer.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Where Do I Put My Converted JSON Data Files?</strong> Once users are able to convert their data in JSON, they quickly struggle with where they should put these files to make publicly available.  Even though website hosting is widely available and inexpensive, users have not associated open data with online website storage. Especially within government organizations, individuals struggle with easy storage of their open data files.</blockquote>
<p>Data Ongithub looks to address both these concerns by delivering a lightweight application for conversion of Excel and CSV files to JSON formats, that is developed completely in client-side JavaScript, which means it can run anywhere in any browser. Since it is JavaScript, Data Ongithub lends itself to running completely on the social coding platform Github, which in this scenario acts as the backend storage for the application.</p>
<p>Data Ongithub can be forked and deployed to run under any Github account as a Github page. Every Github repository starts as a master branch, then once you add a Github Page, it adds a gh-pages branch to the repository. Data Ongithub uses the gh-pages branch as the user interface of the application and then employs the master branch as the backend JSON file storage.</p>
<p>Using <a title="oauth.io" href="http://oauth.io">oAuth.io</a>, Data OnGithub enables completely client-side authentication using Github oAuth, and if a user is a member of the repository, they are allowed to not just upload and convert common open data file formats, but also save them as JSON files to the master repository.  This approach creates a self-contained data conversion, management and storage platform that if you keep open source, is completely free to operate.  Think of it as a "pod" for your open data.</p>

<p>I'm working on a series of simple scripts that help people deploy APIs from some of the most common data sources. I'm starting with a series of PHP scripts, and a couple weeks ago I did a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/deploy-api-public-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">public Google Spreadsheet to API demo</a>, and this week I want to show how to secure access to the API by requiring an AppID and AppKey which will allow you to track on who has access to the API.</p>
<p>For this PHP implementation, I'm using the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">SLIM framework</a>, which provides a dead simple REST framework you can use to deploy an API from a variety of data sources.   To begin deploying an API from your Google Spreadsheet datastore, download the REST library and upload to your server that runs PHP.</p>
<p>Slim is pretty straightforward to work with, to add each API endpoint you just add a single PHP file under methods. For this how-to guide we are going to add a simple endpoint from our spreadsheet products data store.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7104824.js"></script>
<p>Next you just add an include reference in the index page for your slim implementation. Everything up until now was the same as the open public Google Spreadsheet to API solution, but not on the index page we will wrap the entry point to the API, with a <a href="http://bit.ly/1cHBhd5">3Scale API Management</a> layer. 3Scale is free to sign up and you pay as you scale, so all it takes to get going is register for a 3Scale account and choose the base account, and under your account settings you will find your key to link this code to your account.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7510004.js"></script>
<p>This API just uses ID, Name, Price and Description of the product, and queries by a simple query parameter. You can use this as a template for your own product database, adding and removing fields as you need, or completely retrofitting for any database table.  That is it, now you have a simple product API that pulls a list of products from a Google Spreadsheet data store.</p>
<p>There are any number of reasons you would want to secure an API driven from a Google Spreadsheet file, to offer advanced search, filtering or just to track on who is accessing resources. This solution just uses 3Scale to secure the API interface, requiring an AppID and Appkey to use the API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully that demonstrates a simple approach to securing an API that is driven from a Google Spreadsheet file.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439653.js"></script>
<p>Before all of this works you need to have an oAuth token, which I created a simple script to handle:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439681.js"></script>
<p>I leave it to you to figure out where you want to store your oAuth tokens, and other goods. I use a config.php file, but can easily be done from database or other:</p>

<p>This week I got a sneak peak of the Smithsonian EDAN API which provides access to meta data of collections housed at the Smithsonian Institute, along with the ability to tag items and build collections.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian is <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/luce-foundation-center-hackathon-tickets-7945919459">holding a hackathon this weekend</a> and I wanted to contribute what I could, so I pulled together a PHP code library as I explored and hacked not the Smithsonian EDAN API. The library isn't a beautiful product ready SDK, but should help the average PHP developer get up to speed on the API and save some time building their app.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/si-data/smithsonian-edan">Smithsonian EDAN API PHP library on Github</a>, learn more <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/luce-foundation-center-hackathon-tickets-7945919459">about the hackathon this weekend on Eventbrite</a>, and follow any other work I'm doing for the Smithsonian around open data and APIs on my <a href="http://si-data.github.io/developer/">Smithsonian Data project on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Overall the FDA Recall API design was perfectly suitable for launch, even though the interface isn't perfect and some of the data is pretty messy, but I'm a big fan of just getting things out there, letting developers hack on it and gather feedback for the next iteration.</p>
<p>The existing FDA Recall API allows you to pull weekly recalls for 5 separate product types including Food, Drugs, Veterinarian, Devices and Biologics. Using the API you can pull each week listing of recalls as well as pull detail on individual recalls.</p>
<p>To get a handle on where they should take the interface I needed to hack on it like I was a developer, so I setup a proxy that runs on AWS EC2 and started coding against each endpoint, then adjusting a Swagger definition until I had something that was acceptable for a v.01.</p>
<p>You can find the result of this work over at the <a href="http://fda-data.github.io/fda-recalls/">FDA Recall API working project I stood up on Github</a>, it should work until they make any adjustments to the pre-production API. You can follow any work I do on <a href="http://fda-data.github.io/developer/index.html">FDA open data and APIs at the main project site</a> I setup.</p>

<p>I was asked to help put some thought into an API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid iniative. First, what is FAFSA:</p>
<blockquote>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the form the U.S. Department of Education (ED) requires to determine your Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The government conducts a &ldquo;need analysis&rdquo; based on financial information, such as income, assets, and other family information, which you (and your parents if you are a dependent student) will be asked to provide.</blockquote>
<p>I'm just getting started with this project, and as I do with all my Public / Private Sector work, I created <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/index.html">an umbrella site for my Department of Education open data and API work</a>, and created an individual project site just for the <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/developer/index.html">Free Application for Federal Student Aid API</a>.</p>
<p>You can participate in the design and development process via the <a href="https://github.com/ed-data">Gitihub repositories</a>, and feel free to ping me @kinlane if you want to get involved. I will post stories here, and on the individual site to chronical its progress, and reference on API Evangelist when applicable.</p>
<p>Next up, understanding what the details of the FAFSA form are, and start considering what some possible architectural designs might work for FAFSA...</p>

<p>I am a programmer with a full understanding of how to deploy, consume and put APIs to use. Even with this knowledge and ability I'm continually blown away by the opportunities APIs afford, even without possessing any programming skills whatsoever.</p>
<p>One API I depend on for my daily monitoring of the API space is the <a title="Pinboard API" href="https://pinboard.in/api/">Pinboard API</a>. As I browse the web, using the Pinboard bookmarklet I can pin any web page for use later, then using the Pinboard API I pull these curated pages into my monitoring, reporting and story development platform. To take this feature one step further, when I star a Tweet on Twitter, Pinboard watches this and automatically bookmarks the Tweet, adding it to my curation as well.</p>
<p>This approach to using APIs has allowed me to define how I use bookmarking as well as what a favorited Tweet means in my personal world of online curation. Using APIs I'm able to wield this power, and drive my story curation and development lifecycle. Of course I wrote the code that interfaces with Pinboard API, but it still shows the ability to define and execute actions in my world using APIs.</p>
<p>As I was pondering this self-defined action that I use on a daily basis, I was trying to think of any new actions that I could define and add to my toolbox. I was looking through the <a title="Youtube Videos from APIStrat Conference" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat?feature=watch">Youtube videos from my recent #APIStrat conference</a>, and I thought how nice it would be to turn these into audio segments available as podcasts through SoundCloud. After a quick search I found an IFTTT recipe that does this automatically when I flag any Youtube video for watching later and automatically uploads as an audio file to SoundCloud. Sweet!</p>
<p>This type of action again shows the power of being able to define and execute your own actions that you can take in your everyday worlds, but in this case you don't have to be a programmer to make it work. Using APIs I was able to define further meaning beyond just watching a video for later, something that ultimately increases the chance I will be able to consume a topic via my SoundCloud iPhone player as I'm walking somewhere, waiting for a plane or who knows where. Also #APIStrat gets the added benefit of syndication to SoundCloud as part of the action.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to educate the masses that these potential recipes for taking action exist out there in the world, but it definitely makes me optimistic for the future of APIs and how they can benefit anyone, even if you aren't a developer.</p>

<p>I just found an interesting brainstorm going on via Github, about how to make government more efficient and interoperable using APIs, that was created by government consultant Leah Bannon (<a href="https://twitter.com/leahbannon">@leahbannon</a>), called <a title="If Gov Then That" href="https://github.com/leahbannon/if-gov-then-that/">If Gov Then That</a>.</p>
<p>The idea?  <strong>Promote gov APIs by making them dead simple and suggesting clever recipes (like IFTTT and Zapier)</strong></p>
<p>Leah has started a rough list of some possible recipes, but needs your help to brainstorm what you'd like to see for developing interoperability and automation recipes in our government.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-google-docs.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm working on a series of simple scripts that help people deploy APIs from some of the most common data sources. I'm starting with a series of PHP scripts, and next up is a private Google Spreadsheet to API, using JSON stored in Github.</p>
<p>For this PHP implementation, I'm using the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">SLIM framework</a>, which provides a dead simple REST framework you can use to deploy an API from a variety of data sources.   To begin deploying an API from your Google Spreadsheet datastore, download the REST library and upload to your server that runs PHP.</p>
<p>Slim is pretty straightforward to work with, to add each API endpoint you just add a single PHP file under methods. For this how-to guide we are going to add a simple endpoint from our JSON products data store.</p>
<p>This project also depends on the <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/">Google Drive API</a> and I use the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-api-php-client/">Google API PHP Client</a> to connect to Google and provide necessary oAuth connectivity.&nbsp;</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439653.js"></script>
<p>Before all of this works you need to have an oAuth token, which I created a simple script to handle:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439681.js"></script>
<p>I leave it to you to figure out where you want to store your oAuth tokens, and other goods. I use a config.php file, but can easily be done from database or other:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439703.js"></script>
<p>Next you just add an include reference in the index page for your slim implementation:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7439726.js"></script>
<p>This API just uses ID, Name, Price and Description of the product, and queries by a simple query parameter. You can use this as a template for your own product database, adding and removing fields as you need, or completely retrofitting for any database table.  That is it, now you have a simple product API that pulls a list of products from a private Google Spreadsheet data store.</p>
<p>This project is more excercise than anything else. I don't recommend deploying a public API driectly off a private Google Spreadsheet. Next up, will be to secure it using an <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">API infrastructure provider like 3Scale</a>, and possibly build in some caching.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've been working through several demos of how to go from common data sources like MySQL and Google Spreadsheet to API over the last couple of weeks.  So far I have five basic working demos:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/21/deploy-api-mysql-to-api">MySQL to API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/21/deploy-api-json-to-api">Local JSON to API</a></li>

<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/deploy-api-public-google-spreadsheet-to-api">Public Google Spreadsheet to API</a></li>
<li><a title="Private Google Spreadsheet to API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/12/deploy-api-private-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">Private Google Spreadsheet to API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These demos are meant to show how easy it is to deploy a simple API from common places you already have data stored. Right now I'm building them in PHP, but will also be building Python, Ruby and Node.JS versions.</p>
<p>These exercises are meant for my newbie readers but are also helping me see API deployment in different ways. I realize how difficult it is to write code that will work for all scenarios. There is a lot of custom work on the data store side, as well as possible the API side, making me feel like it is best to use an API definition in the middle.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the next phase of my API deployment tools will be about generating API definitions, which currently will be <a href="http://bit.ly/1j2KERU">Swagger</a>, but will also develop <a href="http://bit.ly/16ZTZYt">RAML</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1cl8tCc">API Blueprint</a> versions of the same code eventually.</p>
<p>Once I have some data store to Swagger tooling I will evolve some of the code I have for generating APIs from Swagger definitions.</p>
<p>Then I will have the different custom parts decoupled from each other, all centered around an API definition and data model which I can publish in <a href="http://bit.ly/1e27KIc">API Commons</a> and evolve in an open, collaborative environment where everyone can benefit, and contribute to my API work.</p>

<p>I was working with Google APIs over the last couple days while building <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/12/deploy-api-private-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">Google Spreadsheet to API tools</a>. It gave me a chance to look around the <a href="https://developers.google.com">Google Developers Area</a> and rediscover some of the positive approaches the API pioneer brings to the table.</p>
<p>In this post I wanted to highlight the <a title="Google Drive Code Libraries" href="https://developers.google.com/drive/downloads">Google Drive Code Libraries</a>. While the Google approach isn't perfect, I think it sets a good bar for what can be achieved by API providers when delivering their own API code libraries.</p>
<p><a title="Google Drive Code Libraries" href="https://developers.google.com/drive/downloads"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google-drive/google-drive-code-samples-2.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I think the languages represented are the baseline for any modern API, and all API providers should consider providing the following languages:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>.NET</li>
<li>Go</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>Objective-C</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
</ul>
<p>Languages like Go and Node.js are definitely forward leaning, but represent very fast growing areas of the API integration space.</p>
<p>Java and Objective-C represent the mobile space, something API providers can't be ignoring in 2013.</p>
<p>If your target audience is the enterprise, you have to have .NET and Java as part of your API library.</p>
<p>PHP, Python and Ruby are the web staples, that are default for any API that is catering to general web developers.</p>
<p>It should get easier to generate code libraries automatically for API providers who have developed some sort of API definition for their APIs, but for others you will still have eto hand-roll your own code lbiraries.</p>

<p>I've created a new playground for some of my work. Pretty much everything at <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> runs on Github, and each new project I produce starts its life as a Github repository.  To support this work I established a new domain called ongithub.</p>
<p>My first series in the ongithub realm is based upon an approach I'm using to deploy very simple APIs, while also introducing and educating people about APIs. I have a handful of simple API designs from working in the government, so I married them with data models derived from <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a>, and publish over 10 very simple API design patterns.</p>
<p>Every one of these demo APIs began as a simple <a title="swagger" href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger specification</a>, which I quickly spun into a web API using the <a title="SLIM REST Framework" href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim REST Framework</a>, then generated a simple API microsite complete with interactive documentation.</p>
<p>These Swagger specifications were the seed of the recent <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/05/3scale-launches-api-commons-to-allow-developers-to-share-apis-under-creative-commons-licenses/">API Commons that 3Scale and API Evangelist just launched</a>. I have plenty of other API designs laying around, but this seemed like a good way to seed the <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> with some simple and common designs.</p>
<p>You can find the following 11 designs at <a title="api.ongithub.com" href="http://api.ongithub.com">api.ongithub.com</a>:</p>

<p>Steve Willmott(<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) from API infrastructure provider <a title="API infrastructure provider" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist launched a new partner project yesterday at <a href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag</a>, that we are calling <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>.  The mission with API commons is to provide a simple and transparent mechanism for the copyright free sharing and collaborative design of API specifications, interfaces and data models.</p>
<p>For a space that is about open access and interoperability the API industry has been very closed about their API designs, and after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/02/helping-eff-urge-the-courts-to-block-copyright-claims-in-oracle-v-google-api-fight/">helping the EFF urge the courts to block copyright claims in the Oracle v. Google API fight</a>, Steve and I thought it would be a good idea to introduce an API commons that would help put the "open" into API designs and data models, and back into the API space in gernal.</p>
<p>API Commons is build entirely on Github and is meant to act as a common index of API definitions and data models that <a href="http://apicommons.org/add-apis.html">anyone can add by generating what we are calling an API Commons Manifest</a> that points to your API definition(s). Using the existing layers of Github, anyone can fork, favorite or follow the best API design patterns and eventually help establish some clear best practices across any government or business sector.</p>
<p>Everything you need to get going is on the site at <a title="apicommons.org" href="http://apicommons.org">apicommons.org</a>. You can join the discussion on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/api-commons">Google Group</a> or by <a href="https://twitter.com/apicommons">following us on Twitter</a>. We are in early stages, but will be dedicating a great deal of time over the holidays to get more API definitions in the commons.</p>
<p>3Scale and I strongly believe that API Commons is what the API industry needs to help deal with some of the clutter in the number of API designs, incentivize the development of open and common tooling around the best API designs and bring reuse, collaboration and copyright concerns out into the open.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Nov 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/open-government-partnership.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/"> </a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/">On the second anniversary of the </a><a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/">Open Government Partnership (OGP)</a>, where we are celebrating a "<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/10/31/fact-sheet-marking-progress-second-anniversary-open-government-partnersh">global effort to encourage transparent, effective, and accountable governance</a>", and that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>OGP has grown to 60 countries that have made more than 1000 commitments to improve the governance of more than two billion people around the globe.  OGP is now a global community of government reformers, civil society leaders, and business innovators working together to develop and implement ambitious open government reforms and advance good governance.</em></p>
<p>That is some pretty significant platform growth! While reading this I'm reminded of how any amount of perceived growth and value delivered via an "open data or API platform" can be immediately muted by the omission of very fundamental building blocks like privacy.</p>
<p>Let's review the building blocks of the Open Government Alliance:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Expand Open Data -&nbsp;</strong>Open Data fuels innovation that grows the economy and advances government transparency and accountability.  Government data has been used by journalists to uncover variations in hospital billings, by citizens to learn more about the social services provided by charities in their communities, and by entrepreneurs building new software tools to help farmers plan and manage their crops.  Building upon the successful implementation of open data commitments in the first U.S. National Action Plan, the new Plan will include commitments to make government data more accessible and useful for the public, such as reforming how Federal agencies manage government data as a strategic asset, launching a new version of Data.gov, and expanding agriculture and nutrition data to help farmers and communities.</li>
<li><strong>Modernize the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) -&nbsp;</strong>The FOIA encourages accountability through transparency and represents a profound national commitment to open government principles.  Improving FOIA administration is one of the most effective ways to make the U.S. Government more open and accountable.  Today, the United States announced a series of commitments to further modernize FOIA processes, including launching a consolidated online FOIA service to improve customers&rsquo; experience and making training resources available to FOIA professionals and other Federal employees.</li>
<li><strong>Increase Fiscal Transparency -&nbsp;</strong>The Administration will further increase the transparency of where Federal tax dollars are spent by making federal spending data more easily available on USASpending.gov; facilitating the publication of currently unavailable procurement contract information; and enabling Americans to more easily identify who is receiving tax dollars, where those entities or individuals are located, and how much they receive.</li>
<li><strong>Increase Corporate Transparency -&nbsp;</strong>Preventing criminal organizations from concealing the true ownership and control of businesses they operate is a critical element in safeguarding U.S. and international financial markets, addressing tax avoidance, and combatting corruption in the United States and abroad.  Today we committed to take further steps to enhance transparency of legal entities formed in the United States.</li>
<li><strong>Advance Citizen Engagement and Empowerment -&nbsp;</strong>OGP was founded on the principle that an active and robust civil society is critical to open and accountable governance.  In the next year, the Administration will intensify its efforts to roll back and prevent new restrictions on civil society around the world in partnership with other governments, multilateral institutions, the philanthropy community, the private sector, and civil society.  This effort will focus on improving the legal and regulatory framework for civil society, promoting best practices for government-civil society collaboration, and conceiving of new and innovative ways to support civil society globally.</li>
<li><strong>More Effectively Manage Public Resources -&nbsp;</strong>Two years ago, the Administration committed to ensuring that American taxpayers receive every dollar due for the extraction of the nation&rsquo;s natural resources by committing to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).  We continue to work toward achieving full EITI compliance in 2016.  Additionally, the U.S. Government will disclose revenues on geothermal and renewable energy and discuss future disclosure of timber revenues.</li>
</ul>
<p>How can you argue with that? Its very sensible set of open government platform building blocks right? However, when you look at the bigger picture you realize there is a significant building block, that us in the tech sector have realized is essential to a healthy platform ecosystem missing:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Citizen Data Privacy -</strong> Ensuring that government respects the online privacy of each and every U.S. citizen, preventing unwanted harvesting of private data or meta data that exists in cloud environments, computer and mobile devices as well as transported across telecommunications infrastructure locally or abroad. When privacy is compromised in the name of law enforcement or national security, the laws, rules and procedures around these accepted situations are made publicly accessible.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is great that our government is committed to expanding open data, increasing transparency and efficiently engaging citizens, and sensibly manage public resources. However if our government wants to act as an open platform, just like any private sector platform, they must respect user privacy.</p>
<p>Without ensuring privacy for users, it doesn't matter how forward thinking your open data, information and API strategy is. Privacy and security are essential building blocks any private or public sector entity looking to build an open platform.</p>
<p>Nice work around the Open Government Partnership, but without addressing the privacy of citizens it is rendered pretty useless.</p>

<p>For this PHP implementation, I'm using the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">SLIM framework</a>, which provides a dead simple REST framework you can use to deploy an API from a variety of data sources.   To begin deploying an API from your Google Spreadsheet datastore, download the REST library and upload to your server that runs PHP.</p>
<p>Slim is pretty straightforward to work with, to add each API endpoint you just add a single PHP file under methods. For this how-to guide we are going to add a simple endpoint from our JSON products data store.</p>

<p>This API just uses ID, Name, Price and Description of the product, and queries by a simple query parameter. You can use this as a template for your own product database, adding and removing fields as you need, or completely retrofitting for any database table.

        <span class="post-date">19 Oct 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.bls.gov/developers/home.htm"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/bureau-of-labor-statistics/bureau-of-labor-statistics-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm working to expand my awareness of APIs in our federal government by spending time each week discovering, reviewing and trying to brainstorm ways to expand and evolve existing government API efforts.</p>
<p>Today I was reviewing the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/developers/home.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics API</a>, where I was pleased to find this valuable labor data available via single series, multiple series, one or more series specifying years.  The API is a pretty straightforward web API, which could use some polishing, but overall it provides machine readable access to this very important data as I would expect.</p>
<p>When I look at federal government APIs I'm trying to find at least one or two ways to help move the API forward, either as constructive criticism for the API providers or ways that the public (me included) can help evolve the community or the API itself from the outside.</p>
<p>My current contributions to the Bureau of Labor Statistics is to add support for the Series ID to the API stack. The Series ID is the single, central parameter you pass to each of the API endpoints, but nowhere does it link to or help the users understand the Series ID, which plays a central role in API operations.</p>
<p>This type of omission by API providers is common. You have the domain expertise in your area, you know the Series ID is the central character, but to people stumbling across or intentionally pulling up the Bureau of Labor Statistics API, this might not be common knowledge.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the roadmap of the Bureau of Labor Statics API should include an API for all of the building blocks and meta data for the Series ID. <a href="http://www.bls.gov/help/hlpforma.htm">There is a lot of rich data available on a Series ID</a>, and while it would take a significant amount of work to develop additional APIs around this data, I think it would significantly add value to the Bureau of Labor Statistics API and increase adoption.</p>
<p>I'm adding this to my list of potential future projects, which could be done external to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but also could be something they may consider doing internally as well.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Oct 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>During the recent federal government shutdown many sources of open data and APIs were suddenly rendered unavailable, including the flagship <a href="http://www.data.gov/">Data.gov</a>. As government workers went home and lights were turned off at federal agencies, so too were the servers that hosted much of the open data and APIs that have been opened up in the last couple years.</p>
<p>Across the web I've encountered discussions from many individuals who state this is how government services work. When government funding disappears, the government services go away, suck it up.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but this is unacceptable in the Internet age. If you see things this way, you are part of the machine that allows government services to be used as a political tool. I agree, that human powered government services go away when funding disappears, but in the age of open data, APIs and the cloud, services are designed and deployed to be self-service and highly available.</p>
<p>When you launch APIs in the cloud, you bundle your budget, service level agreement and the tech into a single package. My funding went away this month and couldn't afford my AWS bill on 10/1, but my server didn't shut down the minute the shutdown happened. I had until the end of the month. Ideally the federal government could go with reserved instances annually or at least quarterly, securing the funding needed to outlast any shutdown.</p>
<p>Even with my heavy usage of AWS for much of my infrastructure, the majority of my world runs on open repositories on Github. I have carefully crafted my public presence using open formats like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON and host these as openly licensed, public repositories that I can operate as no cost the social coding platform.</p>
<p>There is no excuse for government open data data and API services to go away during a shutdown like we just experienced. Open data and APIs represent a new, self-service future for government services. This model won't ever completely replace vital government services, but augment the physical services we depend on every day.</p>
<p>The fact that open data and API driven services are bundled with legacy web and physical government services represents a lack of vision, passion and drive to push government services into the digital age. If an agency is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> making assets available via open data or APIs, or is bundling them along with other legacy services, they are allowing these services to be used political tool in the current Washington D.C. game.</p>
<p>Let's make sure that open data and APIs are not federal government services business as usual in DC. C'mon it is 2013!</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Oct 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/att/universal-library-sign.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>The primary mission of API Evangelist is to spread awareness of APIs amongst the masses, expanding the audience beyond just the IT crowd, and developer community. Initially I wanted to make sure business leaders understood the potential of APis, so that they funded API initiatives within their companies. In 2012 I feel that APIs have hit a critical mass, and while I still evangelize APIs to business leaders I'm shifting a portion of my focus to the average Internet user.</p>
<p>APIs impact almost every aspect of our daily lives from logging into Facebook on our mobile phones to purchasing gasoline at the corner gas station. As API usage spreads across business, the government and the Internet of Things (IoT), the everyday citizen will be using APIs more and more each day. While many of these citizens will never hack on an API at the code level, I'm seeing a need emerge for everyone individual to be aware of APIs, much like they need a certain level of economic and financial awareness in every day life.</p>
<p>When it comes to our world of finances, every single adult must have a certain level of awareness of how our financial system operates. You don't need to understand the inner workings of banking and global markets, but you need to know how to setup a bank account, apply for credit or debit cards, balance your checkbook and pay your taxes. As our lives move online and the API economy grows, our data is fast becoming the online currency on Internet platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, the need for us to understand the mechanisms at play in this new digital economy increases.</p>
<p>Virtually every platform we use online employs APIs in some capacity. These platforms use APIs and often an open authentication standard called oAuth to allow us to give access to our data that resides on platforms to the applications and other systems we use daily. We login to news and media sites using our Facebook login, we give access to our Instagram photos to scrapbooking applications using oAuth and APIs and much more. If you use Facebook or Pinterest on your cell phone, you are using APIs daily.</p>
<p>Much like your bank accounts, you are giving access to your Facebook or Pinterest accounts to 3rd parties, and you don't want just any companies application to make deposits or withdrawals of information without your knowledge. This is where a certain level of awareness around APIs and oAuth comes into play. As an average user you may not need to actually handle an oAuth token or parse JSON, but you will initiate the oAuth flow regularly and potentially import and export JSON data between systems regularly.</p>
<p>In the API economy users will initiate potentially thousands of transactions daily, in contrast to the handful of transactions you may initiate via your credit cards and bank accounts. Yet we have less literacy around APIs than we do about these financial systems. We are giving financial management courses in high school and college, and are required to take them as part of debt management, divorce and bankruptcy cases. Similar awareness around APIs, security and privacy is needed for the average citizen in the Internet age.</p>
<p>When I tell developers or the technically savvy user that I'm educating the masses about APIs, they often state that there is no reason the average person will ever need to know about APIs. Consciously or subconsciously this is part of the current climate of Internet technology and the exploitative stance Silicon Valley investors have set into motion. The Facebooks and Twitters of the world do not want you understanding how your data is being accessed and transacted, because behind the curtain they are profiting from your information, which is the lifeblood, currency and value of the API economy.</p>
<p>I will continue to work for more API and oAuth literacy amongst the "normals", establishing at least a high level awareness of how the API economy works within in every online citizen, helping evolve toward a more web literate society, which will benefit everyone, even Silicon Valley--whether they like it or not.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Oct 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.mapbox.com"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mapbox/mapbox-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>On June 29th, 2006, Google launched Google Maps API allowing developers to put Google Maps on their own sites using JavaScript. The API launch was just shy of 6 months after the release of Google Maps as an application, and was in direct response to the number of rogue apps developed that were hacking the application--demonstrating the demand for a JavaScript based, API driven mapping solution for developers.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 7 years, and maps are a central fixture of virtually every web and mobile application we depend on daily. While Google Maps is still the heavyweight in the space, their now classic map interface, proprietary tooling and search centric mindset leaves a huge opportunity for disruption in the app economy, and the venture capital firm <a href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/wp/">Foundry Group</a> is betting that startup mapping provider <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a> is the solution that will de-throne Google, with a <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/10million-funding-foundry-group/">10M investment in MapBox</a>&nbsp;earlier today.</p>
<p>What makes MapBox such a good investment? At first look, it is clear that MapBox is winning over developers and existing players like Foursquare and Evernote by providing very clean, attractive mapping solutions that contain street, terrain and satellite layers, but when you take a closer look at the platform, you see the MapBox allure isn't just about maps. The value of MapBox is also about their approach to delivering a platform that begins with a heavy focus on open specifications, embracing of APIs, heavy investment in JavaScript, and a knowledge of modern cloud architecture, with strong support for mobile apps.</p>
<p><strong>Open Specifications</strong><br />In 2013, when you are looking to deploy a true platform, you have to shed your self-centered approach to technology, do your homework on what are the best practices and standards that exist across your industry, and don't re-invent the wheel or try to keep things closed and proprietary, making everything you do a two-way street that benefits the entire ecosystem. This is how you establish a true platform ecossytem, one that developers will believe in and embrace. This is what MapBox has done by building their platform around four very critical open mapping specifications:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://github.com/mapbox/tilejson-spec">TileJSON</a></strong> - TileJSON is a standard format for describing various aspects of a map and makes for an easy entry point for loading, showing, and describing maps, allowing developers to keep track of information about maps,where their tiles are stored, their centerpoints, bounds, supported zoom levels, markers data, attribution, and more.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://github.com/mapbox/simplestyle-spec">simplestyle-spec</a> </strong>- The simplestyle spec is a practical approach to describing visual markers on a map, for styling markers and maintaining a distinction between content and visual styling can be tricky when annotating maps.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec">mbtiles-spec</a></strong> - The mbtiles specification is an open approach to storing<span>&nbsp;tiled map data in&nbsp;</span><a href="http://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a><span>&nbsp;databases for immediate usage and for transfer, making invidual tiles portable and easily migrated between apps and systems.</span></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://github.com/mapbox/utfgrid-spec">utfgrid-spec</a></strong> - UTFGrid is a format for interactive data that uses JSON and can be transferred tile-by-tile to fit maps of any scale, allowing scalable interaction of maps within applications.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.mapbox.com"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/openstreetmaps/openstreetmap-logo.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Open standards help provide grounding anchors for any platform, and MapBox is going all in, by not just employing these four open specifications--MapBox is also entirely powered by <a title="OpenStreetMap" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/51.500/-0.100">OpenStreetMap</a>, an active community of tens of thousands of dedicated open source mappers who keep MapBox maps up to date and accurate in a real-time, crowdsourced way.</p>
<p>The approach MapBox is taking to building their platform on top of an existing open platform, and embracing the best of breed open standards, sends a signal to its fast evolving ecosystem, that MapBox is not just about building out their own intellectual property like Google, Bing, Apple and other providers are. MapBox is  about investing in an open ecosystem of maps, standards, tools and resources that benefit the entire world of mapping.</p>
<p><strong>API Driven Integration </strong><br />MapBox provides static and REST API access to all aspects of the mapping platform providing developers with programmatic interfaces for all aspects of the mapping ecosystem. Developers can work with maps, tiles, markers and geocoding services directly via API interface, and use SSL to secure integration, and JSONP to integrate with mapping services across any domain.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Layers</strong><br /> The ability to customize every layer of a map, making it as meaningful as possible to each application is the future of mapping. MapBox allows for the development of custom maps, markers and related data, allowing developers to define mapping layers as containers of rich context that will benefit the end-user experience and establish millions of virtual map tiles and layers as rich stores of geo and context relevant information.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mapbox/mapbox-streets.png" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p><strong>Next Generation Architecture</strong> <br />MapBox reflects the latest approaches to scalable, real-time platform development using Node.js, a JavaScript driven approach that delivers high input / output throughput which naturally scales on top of a redundant, distributed cloud infrastructure deployed using Amazon Web Services. The MapBox approach to architecture is fast becoming the standard for API driven, scalable platforms, something that developers and companies are recognizing provide the elastic base that web and mobile applications are demanding.</p>
<p><strong>Ubiquitous JavaScript </strong><br />The use of JavaScript is present across all aspects of MapBox, from the server-side Node.js platform to client-side MapBox.js JavaScript API. MapBox has developed MapBox.js as a plugin that leverages Leaflet, an existing, leading open-source JavaScript library that provides the basic ability to embed a map into a page, and handles the fundamental operation of map interaction. MapBox employs JavaScript to provide a resilient back-end, the embeddable and client side tools developers have grown used to, while also extending its embrace of existing open standards, by integrating with the existing mapping frameworks like Leaflet.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Focused </strong><br />MapBox identifies that mobile is a major driver of the growing role maps are playing in our daily lives, with a GPS in all of our pockets, and providing realtime location data to applications. MapBox has invested in providing iOS SDKs for developing rich mapping solutions for the iPhone, including native mapping based upon Apple's MapKit with their MapBox MBXMapkit. Beyond mobile specific SDKs, the MapBox API provides many mobile focused resources including the ability to optimize resolution of mapping images and overall access via modern, mobile friendly web APIs.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mapbox/mapbox-mobile.png" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p><strong>Simplicity Rules </strong><br />The simple, attractive approach to mapping that MapBox introduces goes being just the visual, with simplicity being a key aspect in the deployment and management of MapBox integrations. MapBox has expanded the opportunity within map layers for developers with many advanced features, but MapBox also provides a suite of ready-to-go HTML, CSS and JavaScript bundles for rapid copy / paste of maps by publishers and hackers who only know enough tech to be dangerous. MapBox also provides an add-on script for Google Docs Spreadsheets called Geo, that lets anyone geocode arbitrary addresses and export spreadsheets as GeoJSON that works fluently with MapBox maps.</p>
<p><strong>Priced to Scale&nbsp;</strong><br />The pricing of cloud platforms are always an immediate signal of the potential of an ecosystem, and developers have been trained to be weary and avoid deeply integrating with platforms who do not have a clear business model. MapBox has a four tier pricing framework starting at $5 a month, then stepping up to $49, $149 and up to $499 a month. MapBox base pricing is derived from map views and storage with an additional rate for any overage charges. MapBox pricing reflects modern cloud utility pricing that provide developers with an essential pay-as-you-go model, ensuring a healthy approach to monetization that is doable for developers, covers MapBox operating costs while also generating sensible revenue for the company.</p>
<p><strong>Serious Client Portfolio</strong><br /> MapBox isn't just a favorite for the usual alpha tech developer community. The existing portfolio of MapBox users includes tech heavyweights like Foursquare, Evernote, Github and Uber including leading news and media groups like NPR, US Today, Financial Times and National Geographic. This is just a sampling of some of the best known brands who have embraced MapBox, and understand the importance of custom, open attractive maps that compliment their brand, while also providing the best user experience possible.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mapbox/mapbox-foursquare.png" alt="" width="600" /></p>
<p><strong>A Platform Blueprint </strong><br />The MapBox approach to delivering their platform by building it on top of existing open standards, baking in APIs access to all resources, while embracing the latest architectural design patterns that focus on lightweight JavaScript and JSON, and having a mobile focus that operates in the cloud, is more than just a blueprint for a successful mapping platform. MapBox is a model that other cloud platforms can follow in their own operations, focusing on simplicity, customization and all the vital features that make a platform truly an open, vibrant ecosystem, while still employing a viable business model.</p>
<p>The opportunity for mapping solutions in the new app economy makes Foundry Group's investment in MapBox a wise one, but it is the embracing of open standards, APIs, JavaScript, the cloud and mobile that will make that investment return at a scale that I think will surprise even the Foundry Group, and deliver similiar to that of existing platforms like Github.</p>
<p>MapBox is a model of how successful technology ecosystems will deliver the resources developers will need to build the next generation of web and mobile applications.</p>

<p>I'm working through the schedule for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/index.php" target="_blank">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference (#APIStrat) in San Francisco</a>, preparing for the 3Scale / API Evangelist produced event October 23rd through 25th.</p>
<p>I'm pretty excited about the lineup we've managed to assemble including keynotes from Pamela Fox (<a href="https://twitter.com/pamelafox">@pamelafox</a>) from Khan Academy, Daniel Jacobson (<a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>) of Netflix, Wynn Netherland (<a href="https://twitter.com/pengwynn">@pengwynn</a>) from Github and Kristin Calhoun (<a href="https://twitter.com/KCalhoun">@KCalhoun</a>) the director of the Public Media Platform, just to name a few of them.</p>
<p>We've worked hard to put together <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/schedule.php">sessions that would speak to all aspects of the API spac</a>e including creation, design and documentation of APIs, API discovery, hypermedia APIs, API testing &amp; debugging, API marketing &amp; evangelism and business models. The goal was to cover topics from basic to advanced, while covering APIs from start to finish.</p>
<p>I'm particularly stoked about the location of the conference. It is right downtown at the <a href="http://www.parc55hotel.com/">Parc55 Hotel</a>, easy walking distance to and from anything.  I always hate conferences that are off the beaten path, and Parc55 will make it easy to hang out and eat, drink and network around the event before and after.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013NYC/">New York City edition of #APIStrat back in February</a> was sold out with over 350 people in attendance. San Francisco is also on track to be sold out, this time with over 600 people in attendance.  Steve Willmott(<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) of 3Scale and I have a blast MC'ing the entire event and facilitating the API conversations, both business and technology, and gearing up to make sure #APIStrat flows.</p>
<p>Make sure and <strong><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/register.php">GET REGISTERED</a></strong>. It was painful to turn away everyone last time, and I'd hate for you to not be able to get in. It is going to be an informative three days with the people who make the API space move forward. I look forward to seeing you there.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2013</span>

<p>I spend a lot of time finding valuable data sets and manually converting, processing and outputting into more usable formats, so that they can be used in APIs that drive mobile and web applications.</p>
<p>I am always on the lookout for new tools that will help me be more efficient in to my work. I'm currently test driving a new platform called <a href="http://delray.io/">Delray</a> that focuses on taking an older concept of extract, transform and load (ETL) and bringing it into the API age by allowing me to define common data resources as inputs, process them one time or on schedule and output data in a cleaner, more usable format.</p>
<p><a href="http://delray.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/seabourne/delray/DelRay-Inputs-Processors-Outputs.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>Using Delray I can define an input from CSV, JSON, MSSQL and other common formats, and save this as the input for my workflow.</p>

<p>Next I can setup a configure a cleansing stage to process the data, allowing me to trim whitespace, replace space, make lowercase and other common things I tend to do manually with my data sets.</p>

<p>Finally I can output the CSV inputed data as a JSON file for use in my APIs and other open data efforts.</p>

<p>Delray represents the next generation of tools that will turn anyone into a data steward, allowing non-developers to take control of critical data flows within your business, organization or government agency.</p>

<p>In 2010 when I started API Evangelist I saw the technological potential of APIs, but while the rest of the online space was focused on what APis could do for developers, I was focused on what APIs could do for the average person.  APIs don't just open up access for developers, they open up access for end-users, introducing interoperability, data portability and ultimately tools that give them control over their own data, content and other valuable resources.</p>
<p>This realization has been central to my mission at API Evangelist, which is about educating the masses about APIs. What is an API? Why are APIs important? I strongly feel that APIs empower end-users to make better decisions about which platforms they use, which applications they adopt, and gives them more ownership, control and agency in their own worlds. When you help an individual understand they can host their own Wordpress blog and migrate from the cloud hosted version of Wordpress, or migrate their blog from Blogger to Wordpress via APIs, you are giving the gift of web literacy.</p>
<p>Leading technology platforms like Amazon, Google, eBay and Flickr have long realized the potential of opening up APIs and empowering end-users. Since then, thousands of platform providers have also realized that opening up APIs enables developers and end-users to innovate around their platform and services, and that there is much more opportunity for growth, expansion and revenue when end-users are API literate. Users are much more likely to adopt a platform and deeply integrate it into their personal or business lives, if they are able to connect it with their other cloud services, taking control and optimizing their information and work flow.</p>
<p>Helping business owners, developers and end-users understand the potential that APIs introduce is essential to the future of education, and will be the heart of a healthy and thriving economy. There is a key piece of technology that reflects this new paradign and is currently operating and thriving across the web, called oAuth. This open authentication (oAuth) standard provides the ability for platforms to open up access to content and data that enables developers to build web and mobile applications, but in a way that gives the control to end-users, who are ulimately the owners of a platforms content and data, and are the target of the applications that developers are building.</p>
<p>oAuth has introduced a new online dance, that is widely known as three-legged authentication, and is being used across common platforms from Google to Facebook, allowing end-users, developers and platforms to interact in a way that makes the Internet go round.  If any of these three legs are out of balance and security or privacy is compromised, or one of the players is not educated and exploitation occurs, the cycle quickly breaks down. This delicate balance encourages all three legs to be educated, empowered and in control over their role in this critical supply chain of the Internet.</p>
<p>Online platforms, and the web and mobile applications that are built on them, are playing an ever increasing role in every aspect of our personal, professional and public lives, from turning in class assignments in high school to paying our taxes as adults.  APIs and oAuth are being used as the pipes and gatekeepers for everything from photos and location data to our vital healthcare records. These online platforms will play a central role in our education from infancy to retirement, and being educated, aware and literate in how these platforms operate is essential to it all working--for everyone involved.</p>

<p>The future of education depends on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all online platforms</span> providing access, interoperability and data portability, while also fully respecting end-users privacy and security and investing in their education about these features and the opportunities they open up.  Education will continue to exist within traditional institutions, but will persist throughout our lives in this new online environment. It is imperative that every citizen possesses a certain level of web literacy to be able to learn, grow and evolve as a human being in this increasingly digital society.</p>
<p>I will be speaking at <a href="http://openva.org/2013/10/09/minding-the-future-program-at-a-glance/">OpenVA, Virginia&rsquo;s First Annual Open and Digital Learning Resources Conference</a> on this topic and continue to work this message into my overall API Evangelist message. The link between APIs, the access they provide, and education is critical. It is something that I feel provides just as many opportunity for exploitation as it does for benefiting end-users, developers and platforms--requiring a great deal of transparency and scrutiny.</p>
<p>Lots to think about, and discuss. &nbsp;I look forward to seeing you at University of Mary Washington for OpenVA.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/10/11/how-to-defrag-your-brain-and-tech-career-in-november/">How To Defrag Your Brain and Tech Career In November</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">11 Oct 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/defrag-2013/DEFRAG-2013-2.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spend the year going from city to city, attending conferences, meet-ups and hackathons--speakng, networking and doing the things that makes my world go around. Every November I find myself a little spun out from the year and need to Defrag my brain, re-organize what I know and re-enforce the most meaningful relationships across my professional career.  This is is done in Broomfield Colorado each November at the <a href="http://defragcon.com/2013/">Defrag Conference</a>.</p>
<p>I arrive the evening before the conference at the Omni Interlocken Resort. It is late at night, the lobby is empty and I walk up to the counter and quickly get my room from the young lady running the desk. I turn around to head to the elevators and notice Brad Feld(<a href="https://twitter.com/bfeld">@bfeld</a>) sitting on the couch, lost in his phone. I spend some time engaging him about the latest trends in technology and investing and the current political climate in the country before I head off to bed.  Where else do you get casual focus time with folks like Brad, then at Defrag?</p>
<p>In the morning I wake up, grab some coffee and pastries and head for the main stage. As I walk in I feel like I've walked into a 1980's rock concert as I'm blasted a classic rock soundtrack from Tom Petty to AC/DC.  I grab a seat in the dark and as I'm waiting for keynotes to start I notice I've accidently joined a table of the cloud computing mafia ranging from Alex Williams(<a href="https://twitter.com/alexwilliams">@alexwilliams</a>)&nbsp;of TechCrunch to cloud pundit Ben Kepes (<a href="https://twitter.com/benkepes">@benkepes</a>) of <a href="http://diversity.net.nz/">Diversity.net.nz</a>.</p>
<p>The morning moves by fast with a engaging array of talks from Amber Case of Esri, to Paul Kedrosky of Bloomber and Kauffman Foundation. After they are done, I roll out of the main stage and get in line for some lunch, which is the only conference lunch I will actually eat, as the Omni Interlocken catering is not the normal fare.</p>
<p>As soon as I'm done I weave in and out of the session stages absorbing talks ranging from business and tech investing, to developer marketing as well as deep dives into data architecture, but I notice one growing trend this year--APIs. Defag's sister event GlueCon was the OG(Original Gangster) API event, but as APIs move from the future of technology into reality across all aspects of the business world, APIs become part of every session at Defrag as well.</p>
<p>After the sessions I go back to main stage for another mind blowing assortment of talks around identity, security, privacy and of course some more APIs, and a very important talk on imperative of women in technology.  Just at the point where I feel like my brain can't absorb any more, the doors open and Eric Norlin, our host, let's us go for the evening.</p>
<p>Before the official reception begins, I need to get some nourishment, so I run over to the Tap Room and devour an assortment of sliders and enjoy an IPA to wash down the enormous amount of API knowledge I had to absorb today. Alright, now I'm ready for some networking at the reception.</p>
<p>I quickly realize the Defrag reception is just an appetizer for a long evening of meaningful conversations with the who's who in the technology space. I spend the next 7 hours bouncing from table to table, toasting with the likes of Mike Maney(<a href="https://twitter.com/the_spinmd">@the_spinmd</a>) the Spin Dr himself, Andy Thurai of Intel and Uri Sarid of <a href="http://mulesoft.com">Mulesoft</a>, to name just a few. Drink after drink I re-enforce existing relationships and make numerous other new connections with faces I might know from their Twitter photos, but haven't actually had the chance to meet in person and take the connection to the next level.</p>
<p>Its 2 AM. With a head full of IPAs and APIs I head off to bed, knowing I have another full two days of this! When I'm done I know I can head home for the holidays, finish off the year properly with the one event I will never miss, because I know my year will not be complete and properly closed out if I miss it.</p>
<p>I hope to see you at <a href="http://defragcon.com/2013/">Defrag</a>, and have a chance to buy you a beer!</p>
