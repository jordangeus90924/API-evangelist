{% include JB/setup %}<p>At a recent presentation at the Business of API conference in San Francisco, Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson argued that two of the ways APIs can be successful in courting new developers are by being self-service and by having a freemium option.Both of these features empower developers to start using an API right away, without entering a credit card, talking to customer service, sales or having to wait for budget approval.They can just sign-up, get a key and start hacking!This shouldnt just be a model for APIs targeting the public developers; it can work with the enterprise as well.This model would allow enterprise developers to get up and running using an API quickly, building their own working prototypes, and in turn, using this prototype to make a case for why a company should use an API -- all without talking to their boss or getting approval.</p>
