While I was in Paris speaking at [API Days][1] last week, a drawing of me was circulated on Twitter.  I was a little speachless when I saw them on Twitter.  I am always looking for new graphics to use in API Evangelist.  I worked for hours to come up with the logo I have, so I was stoked to see someone create something so cool, in the moment.
