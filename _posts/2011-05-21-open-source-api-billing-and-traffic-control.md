{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was writing a story for ProgrammableWeb tonight on the enhancements Google made recently to its API console.I hadnt properly covered the API Console, API Explorer here on API Evangelist, so I took the time, played with more, and wrote up overviews for each.I noticed something while reviewing Googles recent efforts to organize their family of 88 APIs, and make it easier to discover, integrate, and manage for developers.Google is taking a similar approach to managing their APIs, as Apigee, Mashery, and 3Scale does for other API providers.Apigee, Mashery, and 3Scale provide a wealth of knowledge when it comes to API deployment that very few companies can touch.</p>
