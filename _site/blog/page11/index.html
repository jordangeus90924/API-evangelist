        <span class="post-date">25 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/zapier/zapier-embeddable-zaps.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’m regularly working to make APIs more accessible to non-developers, and <a href="https://zapier.com/app/explore">Zapier</a> is the #1 way I do this. Zapier provides ready-to-go API integration recipes for over 750 APIs, providing IFTTT-like functionality, but in a way that actual pays the whole API thing forward (Zapier has APIs, IFTTT does not). One of the benefits of having APIs is you can build embeddable tooling on top of them, and <a href="https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/shared-zaps/#embedding-your-zaps">Zapier has some basic embeddable tools available to anyone</a>, with some more advanced options for <a href="https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/zap-templates-partners-api/">partners via their partner API</a>.</p>

<p>Using the Zapier basic embeddable widget you can list one or many Zaps, providing recipes for any user to integrate with one or many APIs, that can be embedded into a web page, or within an application:</p>

<p>&#x3C;script type="text/javascript" src="https://zapier.com/zapbook/embed/widget.js?guided_zaps=2618,1035,977"&#x3E;&#x3C;/script&#x3E;</p>

<p>All you do is add the id for each of the Zaps you wish to list, under the “guided_zaps” variable, and it will list the icon, title, and “use this zap” functionality, all wrapped in the appropriate powered by Zapier branding. I’m developing lists of useful Zaps ranging from working with Google Sheets, to managing social media presence on Twitter and Facebook. Everyday, useful things that the average user might find valuable when it comes to automating, and taking control over their online presence. Anytime I reference possible API integration use cases in a story, I’m going to start embedding a widget of actual Zaps you can use to accomplish whatever I’m talking about below.</p>

<p>I’m also trying to carve out time to develop some of my own Zaps, and sign up to become a Zapier partner, so I can begin to develop some more advanced editions of embeddable tooling. I want to make my own JavaScript library that will spider any text in a story, and turn references to API integration into popup tooltips, with API literacy, training, and action links. I have a handful of API 101 style solutions I’d like to see exist, but at this point it is a matter of carving out the time to make happen. I’m working to invest more in my guidance for my power user, non-developer audience, continuing to put APIs within reach for everyone–not just the developer, IT, and startup community.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/old-yellow-house.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I know that catering to the enterprise is where the money is at. I know that playing with all the cool new containerized, event sourcing, continuously integrated and deployed solutions are where you can prove you know your stuff. However, in my world I come across so many companies, organizations, and government agencies that just need things to work. They don’t have the skills, resources, or time to play with everything cool, and really could just use some better access to their data and content across their business, with trusted partners, and maybe solicit the help of 3rd party developers to help carry the load.</p>

<p>Many of the conversation I am having within startup and tech circles often focus on scale, and the latest tech. I get that this is the way things work in alpha tech circles, and this is applicable in your worlds, always moving forward, pushing the scope of what we are doing, and making sure we are playing with the latest tools is how it’s done. However, not everyone has this luxury, and many companies can’t afford to hire the talent needed, or pay the cost associated with doing things the most modern approach, or even the right way. Remember, when you are talking about Kafka, Kuburnetes, Docker, GraphQL, and other leading edge solutions, you are talking from a place of privilege. Meaning you probably have the time, resources, and space to implement the most modern approach, and have the team to do it right.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to stop you from having fun, and doing what you do. I am just trying to share what I’m seeing on the ground at companies, organizations, and government agencies I’m talking to. I’m spending a lot of time trying to help get folks up to speed on everything I’m seeing, and many of them are intimidated by the pace at which things move, the scope of implementations they are reading about across tech blogs, and insecure about what they don’t know. I’m finding that I’m helping folks think through their basic usage of the cloud, over containerization, and helping them understand basic APIs and webhooks, over evented architecture and modern approaches to messaging. They just aren’t ready for much of what I’m reading and tracking on in my monitoring of the API space.</p>

<p>I guess I’m just asking for some help. If you are writing about tech, maybe reach out to small businesses and organizations outside the tech bubble and ask them what their challenges are, over writing about yet another startup, or cool new tech. Maybe take a portion of that investment you just got and establish some grants for nonprofits, students, or others to spend some time learning about new technology (not yours), and pay a contractor to help them solve a single, small problem–enjoying a little micro procurement assist, on your dime. Maybe rather than disrupting an industry, you could reach out to some smaller companies in the space and mentor them? IDK. I’m just spitballin here. I just feel like the gap is widening when it comes to technology on the ground in your average city, over what I see in the Bay Area, and other major tech hubs. If we don’t work to close this gap, it is going to bite us all in the ass at some point, if it already isn’t.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/methuselah-mountain.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>A regularly question I get from business folks out in the space, is regarding where they should start with APIs. My world is usually broke into two areas: 1) Providing APIs, and 2) Consuming APIs. I’d say that these business folk I keep coming across could easily span both of these areas, making it significantly more complicated to help them understand where they should be getting started with APIs. With the API landscape being so wide, and APIs becoming so ubiquitous across many industries, helping someone onboard to the concept can get pretty complex and confusing pretty quick.</p>

<p>I always try to prime the pump with <a href="http://101.apievangelist.com/">my API 101 material</a>, and encourage folks to learn about <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">the history of APIs</a>. I find that before you begin getting bombarded with the technical details of APIs it helps to get the lay of the land, and understand what is going on at the highest level, developing a better understanding of how we got here. Before you get working with any single API, you should try to understand why it has begun to be such a big part of everything we know of online today, and via our mobile phones. Most people don’t realize that they are using APIs everyday, as part of their regular business activity, and common things they do in their personal lives–things like buy products from Amazon, and sharing updates with friends on Facebook.</p>

<p>Next, I recommend looking at the software you use each day in your work. If you are an architect, look a the CAD software you are using. If you are in healthcare, look at the administrative systems you use, and the devices you put to work. If you are retail, look at the point of sale (POS), and payment systems you use. All of these companies have APIs in one form or another. They might not all be public APIs like Facebook, Twitter, and Google, but they have APIs that might make a lot more sense to you in your world. You should be learning about the companies behind this software, searching their websites, knowledge-bases, and other systems for APIs, and understanding what they do, and how you can possibly put them to use in your world, and help you do what you do better.</p>

<p>Take a look at your smart phone. All those icons for the applications you use have APIs behind them. Mobile phones are why APIs have become such a big thing. It is how information is sent and received by mobile applications. If you want to learn about APIs, you should start by learning in the context of the applications, services, and tooling you are already depending on and putting to use. A great example of this for business users can be found with the spreadsheet. Both Google and Microsoft have APIs, allowing you to get data into, and out of a spreadsheet. I often feel like the spreadsheet API is one of the most important, and underrated APIs out there, and spreadsheets are one of the most important API clients out there as well, but often gets overlooked by developers who don’t love the spreadsheet as much as business users.</p>

<p>As a professional in any industry, I recommend starting here. The chances you will discover and learn about APIs in a more meaningful and impactful way is greater, than if you just take some learn to code, or other technical approach. I’m going to begin building this into my API lessons and training work I’ve kicked off recently, and see if I can develop more material that is less API provider vs API consumer, and more about helping folks in specific industries, or who might be using specific software, platforms, services, and tools. Regardless, if you are looking to jumpstart your own API learning I recommend just looking around you, I think you’d be surprised how many APIs there are behind the solutions you are already putting to use.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/border-traffic.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7YUymQkZ_8&amp;feature=youtu.be">I was talking to my friends TC2027 Computer and Information Security class at Tec de Monterrey via a Google hangout today</a>, and one of the questions I got was around managing API sessions using JWT, which was spawned from a <a href="https://blog.websecurify.com/2017/02/hacking-json-web-tokens.html">story about security JWT</a>. A student was curious about managing session across API consumption, while addressing securing concerns, making sure tokens aren’t abused, and there isn’t API consumption from 3rd parties who shouldn’t have access going unnoticed.</p>

<p>I feel like there are two important, and often competing interests occurring here. We want to secure our API resources, making sure data isn’t leaked, and prevent breaches. We want to make sure we know who is accessing resources, and develop a heightened awareness regarding who is accessing what, and how they are putting them to use. However, the more we march down the road of managing session, logging, analyzing, tracking, and securing our APIs, we are also simultaneously ramping up the surveillance of our platforms, and the web, mobile, network, and device clients who are putting our resources to use. Sure, we want to secure things, but we also want to think about the opportunity for abuse, as we are working to manage abuse on our platforms.</p>

<p>To answer the question around how to track sessions across API operations I recommended thinking about that identification layer, which includes JWT and OAuth, depending on the situation. After that you should be looking other dimensions for identifying session like IP address, timestamps, user agent, and any other identifying characteristics. An app or user token is much more about identification, than it ever provides actual security, and to truly identify a valid session you should have more than one dimension beyond that key to acknowledge valid sessions, as well as just session in general. Identifying what healthy sessions look like, as well as unhealthy, or unique sessions that might be out of the realm of normal operations.</p>

<p>To accomplish all of this, I recommend implementing a modern API management solution, but also pulling in logging from all other layers including DNS, web server, database, and any other system in the stack. To be able to truly identify healthy and unhealthy sessions you need visibility, and synchronicity across all logging layers of the API stack. Does the API management logs reflect DNS, and web server, etc. This is where access tiers, rate limits, and overall consumption awareness  really comes in, and having the right tools to lock things down, freeze keys and tokens, as well as being able to identify what healthy API consumption looks like, providing a blueprint for what API sessions should, or shouldn’t be occurring.</p>

<p>At this point in the conversation I also like to point out that we should be stopping and considering at what point all of this API authentication, security, logging, analysis, and reporting and session management becomes surveillance. Are we seeking API security because it is what we need, or just because it is what we do. I know we are defensive about our resources, and we should be going the distance to keep data private and secure, but at some point by collecting more data, and establishing more logging streams, we actually begin to work against ourselves. I’m not saying it isn’t worth it in some cases, I am just saying that we should be questioning our own motivations, and the potential for introducing more abuse, as we police, surveil, and secure our APIs from abuse.</p>

<p>As technologists, we aren’t always the best at stepping back from our work, and making sure we aren’t introducing new problems alongside our solutions. This is why I have my <a href="http://surveillance.apievangelist.com/">API surveillance research</a>, alongside my API <a href="http://authentication.apievangelist.com/">authentication</a>, <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">security</a>, <a href="http://logging.apievangelist.com/">logging</a>, and other management research. We tend to get excited about, and hyper focused on the tech for tech’s sake. The irony of this situation is that we can also introduce exploitation and abuse around our practices for addressing exploitation and abuse around our APIs. Let’s definitely keep having conversations around how we authenticate, secure, and log to make sure things are locked down, but let’s also make sure we are having sensible discussions around how we are surveilling our API consumers, and end users along the way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/old-barn.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>API management was the first area of my research I started tracking on in 2010, and has been the seed for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/api-lifecycle/">the 85+ areas of the API lifecycle I’m tracking on in 2017</a>. It was a necessary vehicle for the API sector to move more mainstream, but in 2017 I’m feeling the concept is just too large, and the business of APIs has evolved enough that we should be focusing in on each aspect of API management on its own, and retire the concept entirely. I feel like at this point it will continue to confuse, and be abused, and that we can get more precise in what we are trying to accomplish, and better serve our customers along the way.</p>

<p>The main concepts of API management at play have historically been about authentication, service composition, logging, analytics, and billing. There are plenty of other elements that have often been lumped in there like portal, documentation, support, and other aspects, but securing, tracking, and generating revenue from a variety of APIs, and consumers has been center stage. I’d say that some of the positive aspects of the maturing and evolution of API manage include more of a focus on authentication, as well as the awareness introduced by logging and analytics. I’d say some areas that worry me is that security discussions often stop with API management, and we don’t seem to be having evolved conversations around service conversation, billing, and monetization of our API resources. You rarely see these things discussed when we talk about GraphQL, gRPC, evented architecture, data streaming, and other hot topics in the API sector.</p>

<p>I feel like the technology of APIs conversations have outpaced the business of APIs conversations as API management matured and moved forward. Advancements in logging, analytics, and reporting have definitely advanced, but understanding the value generated by providing different services to different consumers, seeing the cost associated with operations, and the value generated, then charging or even paying consumers involved in that value generation in real-time, seems to be being lost. We are getting better and the tech of making our digital bits more accessible, and moving them around, but we seemed to be losing the thread about quantifying the value, and associating revenue with it in real-time. I see this aspect of API management still occurring, I’m just not seeing the conversations around it move forward as fast as the other areas of API management.</p>

<p>API <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">monetization</a> and <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">plans</a> are two separate area of my research, and are something I’ll keep talking about. Alongside <a href="http://authentication.apievangelist.com/">authentication</a>, <a href="http://logging.apievangelist.com/">logging</a>, <a href="http://analysis.apievangelist.com/">analysis</a>, and <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">security</a>. I think the reason we don’t hear more stories about API service composition and monetization is that a) companies see this as their secret sauce, and b) there aren’t service providers delivering in these areas exclusively, adding to the conversation. How to rate limit, craft API plans, set pricing at the service and tier levels are some of the most common questions I get. Partly because there isn’t enough conversation and resources to help people navigate, but also because there is insecurity, and skewed views of intellectual property and secret sauce. People in the API sector suck at sharing anything they view is their secret sauce, and with no service providers dedicated to API monetization, nobody is pumping the story machine (beyond me).</p>

<p>I’m feeling like I might be winding down <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">my focus on API management</a>, and focus in on the specific aspects of API management. I’ve been working on my API management guide over the summer, but I’m thinking I’ll abandon it. I might just focus on the specific aspects of conducting API management. IDK. Maybe I’ll still provide a 100K view for people, while introducing separate, much deeper looks at the elements that make up API management. I still have to worry about onboarding the folks who haven’t been around in the sector for the last ten years, and help them learn everything we all have learned along the way. I’m just feeling like the concept is a little dated, and is something that can start working against us in some of the conversations we are having about our API operations, where some important elements like security, and monetization can fall through the cracks.</p>

<p>I am always surprised at the folks who I meet for the first time who automatically assume I’m all about the REST. It is always something that is more telling about the way they see the world (or don’t), than it ever is about me as THE API Evangelist. It is easy to think I’m going to get all RESTY, and start quoting Roy, but I’m no card carrying RESTafarian, like my buddy Darrel Miller (@darrel_miller) (not that is what Darrel does ;-). Really the only thing I get passionate about is making sure we are reusing the web, and I am pretty much be a sellout on almost everything else.</p>

<p>I am just looking to understand how folks are exposing interfaces for their digital resources using the web, making them available for use in other applications. I feel like RESTful approaches are always a good start for folks to begin considering, and learning from when beginning their journey, but I’m rarely going to get all dogmatic about REST. There are trade-offs with any approach you take to providing programmatic interfaces using the web, and you should understand what these are whether your are using REST, Hypermedia, (g)RPC, GraphQL, or any other number of protocols and technologies available out there. A RESTful approach using the web just tends to be the lowest common denominator, the cheapest, and widest reaching solution we have on the table. Rarely is it ever the perfect solution–there are no such things. #sorry</p>

<p>If you are entering into discussions with me thinking I’m 100% team REST, you are mistaken, and you have profiled yourself considerably for me. It shows me that you haven’t done a lot of (wide) reading on the subject of APIs, and while you may be an expert, you probably are a very siloed expert who doesn’t entertain a lot of outside opinions, and keep an eye on how the space is shifting and changing. When I encounter folks like you in the space you’ll often find me pretty quiet, submissive, and just nodding my head a lot. As you aren’t my target audience, and there isn’t much I can say that will shift your world view. Your opinions are pretty set, and I’m not going to be the one who moves them forward. My role is to reach folks are looking for answers, not those who already have them.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope/yellowtree/clean_view/file-00_00_50_85.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bizcoder.com/openapi-is-not-what-i-thought">Darrel Miller has a thought provoking post on OpenAPI not being what he thought</a>, shining a light on a very important dimension of what OpenAPI does, and doesn’t do in the API space. In my experience, OpenAPI is rarely what people think, and I want to revisit once slice of Darrel’s story, in regards to folks generally thinking OpenAPI (Swagger) as being all about API documentation. In 2017, the majority of folks I talk to think OpenAPI is about documenting your APIs–something that always makes me sad, but I get it, and is something I regularly work to combat this notion.</p>

<p>First, and foremost, OpenAPI is a bridge to understanding and being able to communicate around using HTTP as a transport, and our greatest hope for helping developers learn their HTTPs and 123s. I meet developers on a regular basis who are building web APIs, yet do not have a firm grasp on what HTTP is. Hell, I’ve had a career dedicated to web APIs for the last seven years, and I’m still developing my grasp on what it is, learning new things from folks like Erik Wilde (<a href="https://twitter.com/dret">@dret</a>), Darrel Miller (<a href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">@darrel_miller</a>), and Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>) on a regular basis. In the API game, you should always be learning, and the web is the center of your existence at the moment as a software engineer, and should be the focus of what you are learning about to push forward your knowledge.</p>

<p>Darrel has a great line in his post where he has “<em>a higher chance of convincing developers to stop drinking Mountain Dew than to pry a documentation generator from the hands of a dev with a deadline.”</em> Meaning, most developers don’t have the time or interest to learn about what OpenAPIs, or can do for them in their busy world, they just want the help delivering documentation–a very visual representation of the work they’ve done, and is something they can demonstrate to their boss, partners, and customers. Most developers aren’t spending the time trying to know and understand everything API, thinking deeply on the subject like Darrel and I are doing. Most don’t even have time to read our blog posts. A sad fact of doing business in the tech space, but is something us in charge of API standards and tooling, or even selling API services should be aware of.</p>

<p>You see an essence of this with API code generators, and API testing from OpenAPI. Although in much lesser quantities than API documentation enjoys. Developers just want the assist, they really don’t care whether it is the right way of doing things, or the wrong way, and how it fits into the bigger picture. API developers just want to get their work done, and move on. It is up to us analysts, standards shepherds, and API service providers to help educate, illuminate, and incentivize developers to get over their limiting views on what OpenAPI is and/or develop the next killer tooling that helps make their lives insanely easier like Swagger UI did for API documentation. We need to learn from the impact this tooling has made, and make sure the other lifecycle solutions we are delivering speak in similar tones.</p>

<p>If you are reading this piece, and are still in the camp of folks who still see OpenAPI as Swagger UI, don’t feel bad, it is a common misconception, and one that was exacerbated by the move from Swagger to OpenAPI. My recommendation is that you begin to look at OpenAPI independent of any tooling it enables. Think of it as a checklist for your HTTP learning, sharing, and communication across your API development team. It shouldn’t be just about delivering documentation, code, tests, or anything else. OpenAPI is about making sure you have the HTTP details of your API delivered in a consistent way, across not just a single APIs, but all the APIs you are delivering. OpenAPI is the bridge to where you are now with your API operations, to where you should be when it comes to the definition, design, deployment, management, and delivering sustainable contracts around the digital assets you are serving up internally, with partners, and 3rd party developers. It may see like extra work to think about it this way, but it is something that will save you time and money down the road.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/subway/hypermedia-siren-subway-stop.png" align="right" width="35%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I am picking up some of my past work, so that I can move forward in a new way. A while ago, I began working on <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/">my subway map API</a> to help me articulate aspects of the API lifecycle, and provide a “vehicle” for helping folks explore some often complex API concepts, in a way that would incrementally introduce them to new ideas. I used the subway map as an analogy because it has been historically used to help folks understand complex systems, and help them navigate it, even if they don’t fully understand everything about it. <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">I gave a talk at @APIStrat in Austin, TX on this subject</a>, but something I haven’t moved forward in over a year.</p>

<p>My new approach to using the subway map model is still using hypermedia (Siren), but I’m not wanting a single API to control the data for every client. I’m looking to develop a static, federated approach to delivering subway map experience. I want to be able to quickly publish a common map, but then be able evolve them independently, designed for specific implementations and use cases. Since I’m so Jekyll and Github centered in how I deliver projects, I’m looking for a way to do this in a static way, that can be forked. So, I got to work on publishing Siren YAML to Github, and seeing if it is possible to use Liquid and HTML as the client. Again, I want this to be static. All this could easily be building this in JavaScript, but I want things static and forkable.</p>

<p><a href="http://jekyll.hypermedia.client.apievangelist.com/design/requests/">For my proof of concept I published 15 “stops” along the request “line” for my API design “area”</a>. I don’t have the visual elements present for this functionality, as I just wanted to prove that I could use Liquid and HTML for a hypermedia client, using Siren YAML published to Github. I was forced to add a layout: property to my Siren schema, which is probably heresy to couple to the client in this way, but it is something I’m willing to take a hit for. Everything else is pure Siren. While there is still a lot more work to be done, I was able to expand the boundaries of how I use hypermedia and Jekyll, in a single proof of concept–telling me the idea is worth moving forward with.</p>

<p>To make things work I published a set of Siren hypermedia YAML documents (I know Kevin, I’m making you cringe, but bear with me) to <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/jekyll-hypermedia-client/tree/master/_design">a Jekyll collection called _design</a>. Then I have <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/jekyll-hypermedia-client/tree/master/_layouts">three Jekyll client templates in the _layouts folder, called area, lines, and stops</a>. My client isn’t that sophisticated for this proof of concept, but I am able to easily work with the entities, properties, and links in Liquid effectively. I’m just wanting to show that I can take my YAML to the next level, and expand my link relations beyond just next and previous that is often associated with Jekyll _posts, opening up <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml">the entire IANA link relations catalog of options</a>, plus anything custom I will need (ie. area, line, stop). It doesn’t look like much, but it provides a pretty compelling example of using Jekyll and Github to deliver complex content that will be changing regularly in a static way.</p>

<p><a href="http://jekyll.hypermedia.client.apievangelist.com/design/requests/">The viewable side of my hypermedia Jekyll subway map API client doesn’t look that attractive yet</a>, but it provides the basic next/previous functionality, as well links back to the area, or line of coverage. This is just the first two types of experience I’m looking to provide as people explore. I will be introducing transfers, help, and other supporting link relations between the content being made available. Eventually the home page of these projects will be a subway map with accompanying key, and then you choose the area, explore lines, and get off on any stop you desire. It’s just a start, but I feel my Jekyll hypermedia client proof of concept is a success, and I’ll get to work on publishing more content, and adding the visual elements that make it truly a subway map experience.</p>

<p><em>I am spending two days this week with the <a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/">Capital One DevExchange</a> team outside of Washington DC, and they’ve provided me with a list of questions for one of our sessions, which they will be recording for internal use. To prepare, I wanted to work through my thoughts, and make sure each of these answers were on the tip of my tongue–here is one of those questions, along with my thoughts.</em></p>

<p>I’m not a big fan of predictions. It is a game that analysts and investors play to try and shape the world they want to see. I’m usually focused on shaping the world I want to see by understanding where we are, how we got here, and making incremental shifts in our behavior today. I tend to think that technology futurists are more about ignoring the past, and being in denial about today, than they are ever about what is happening in the future. However, with that said, let me share some thoughts about what I think the future will hold when it comes to doing APIs.</p>

<p>Mostly, by 2024 things will look much like they do today. Nothing moves as fast we think they will in the tech sector. I’ve done a lot of studying the history of predictions by technology blogs, and analysts firms over the last decade about what they thought 2017 would be like, and it is 98% bullshit. It was more about getting what they wanted in the year they made the prediction, than it was ever about the future. Technology always feels like it is moving faster than ever before but honestly, what has happened in the last decade that is really seismic? I’d say iPhone is the biggest, with mostly everything else being pretty incremental, and slow moving.</p>

<p>By 2024, we will still be struggling with technical debt. However, the debt limit ceiling will have been raised significantly. We won’t have decoupled the monolith, all while adding to it. The web will still be preferred approach to delivering APIs, although there will be numerous add-ons, and proprietary bastardizations surgically attached to it. REST APIs will be relic of the past, but web APIs will still be the preferred approach because it is simple, however there will be multiple speed API approaches reflecting what we are seeing from gRPC. Think about how different the web APIs are today, from the web APIs in 2010–there really isn’t that many changes. They still suck as bad as they did back then, with a few well designed ones available–just like there was in 2010.</p>

<p>There will be significant movements in the world of API definitions and schema. OpenAPI will have opened up a flood of competing specifications, as well as industry specific implementations using those formats. With the mainstream adoption of web APis, the need for common schema, dictionaries, and design patterns will increase. A significant portion of these API definitions will follow the web, reusing existing patterns, and evolving them in meaningful ways. The rest will be proprietary, complex, and not actually do many API providers much good, yet they will be used by popular APIs, so they will end up being baked into systems and applications. There will never be a single definition to rule them all, although we will see some strong media types emerge that encourage doing APIs in a powerful way at scale.</p>

<p>Much of the API sector will be deployed on the backs of cloud giants. The web landscape will be so volatile and un-secure, small business will not be able to operate without the assistance of platforms with the security expertise to defend our APIs. Cyberwarfare will be normalized, and corporations and state actors will routinely disrupt, infiltrate, and make doing business online near impossible. If you want to stay in business as an API provider you will have to pay a security tax to a cloud enforcer to ensure your services stay up. This will continue to give a unhealthy amount of power to large companies to dictate which types of APIs should be available, which new ideas get created, and shaping the overall notion of what is APIs–kind of the gilded age, after the wild west.</p>

<p>In 2024, algorithmic APIs will outpace strictly data or content APIs, with artificial intelligence, and machine learning dominating the landscape. This shift will mostly cause noise, disturbances, and fuel cyber(in)security, but there will be incremental evolution in these disciplines that actually deliver real business value. There will be enough value created from AI, ML, and algorithmic APIs to keep investment going, but most of it will be hype, over promised, and just confusing to users, continuing to give APIs a bad time. Luckily APIs will also be used to help make these black box algorithms more observable, accountable, and regulated, although may will still remain out of sight due to intellectual property, complexity, and other forms of technological theater.</p>

<p>Another aspect the API space that will continue to move front and center is event-driven architecture. As API move into the mainstream, much of the design thinking that goes into them will be heavily centered around business activities, and the events that matter to humans (and companies). We will see event sourcing, webhooks, and real-time technologies continue to evolve and grow, and become baked into our API approaches, much like REST design patterns are today. While it will continue to grow and evolve, the event landscape will be littered with technologies that confuse, complex, and go against much of what we’ve built over the years with simple API design approaches, but this won’t stop folks from thinking it is a good idea.</p>

<p>APIs in 2024 won’t be the shiny, API saved world we envision. It will still be pretty messy, and many will question whether we should be doing APIs in the first place, but doing business on the web will require moving data, and content around at scale, leveraging open and commercial algorithms to get things done. So APIs will persist, but not necessary thrive. They will be ubiquitous, and rarely exciting. Kind of like a gas station or convenience store. You will use them daily, they will be everywhere, but rarely will they bring inspiration as they have in the early days. One side effect of this will be that all government will be doing APis, but sadly it won’t bring the agility, and nimbleness we’ve all promised. It will usually just make things harder, and open public resources up for exploitation by commercial vendors who are offering the true solution for a fee in the parking lot.</p>

<p><em>I am spending two days this week with the <a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/">Capital One DevExchange</a> team outside of Washington DC, and they’ve provided me with a list of questions for one of our sessions, which they will be recording for internal use. To prepare, I wanted to work through my thoughts, and make sure each of these answers were on the tip of my tongue–here is one of those questions, along with my thoughts.</em></p>

<p>The main API development in 2017 has been the continued shift towards mainstream API adoption. The concept has been moving outside of the tech sector for a couple years now, but in 2017 it is very clear that it’s not just something startups are doing. This is having a profound shift in how we talk about APIs, and how we approach the API lifecycle. APIs have historically been something new and smaller companies are doing, but often will deliver at scale (AWS, SalesForce, eBay, etc.). The mainstream shift in the API sector brings a whole new set of challenges, and opportunities as existing companies, with existing technology in place, work to shift towards an API way of doing things.</p>

<p>This shift impacts the technology of doing APIs, but really isn’t the main event–things will be business as usual when it comes to the technology of APIs for many years to come. I’d say the main event has been in the business of doing APIs. How these APIs get funded will be entirely different from how startup focused APIs get funded. This shift in financial incentives behind why APIs are developed, operated, and ultimately deprecated, will have profound effects on what is an API. They will have less of the startup shine, and become more robust, providing commercial, and industrial grade digital resources that are more mature than the newer, younger APIs we’ve seen in recent years.</p>

<p>Alongside this shift, another development in the business of APIs has occurred. The funding landscape for startups has shifted substantially. In the last couple years the majority of startup funding has dried up, making it a much more competitive environment for the API providers and service providers startups to get the money they need to grow and evolve. This vacuum has allowed for a new, more volatile, and API driven way of funding to emerge, based upon the blockchain, in the form of Initial Coin Offering, or simply ICO. This approach to raising money is quickly becoming a preferred, albeit a more volatile approach to funding startups. It is something that will work against the reliability and stability of depending on APIs, even more so than we saw with startup and investment culture over the last 7 years.</p>

<p>These two shifts in the business of APIs will be at odds with each other. There will still be startups doing APIs, but they will often be more volatile, ephemeral, and unreliable, but they will still continue to define what is next. While the mainstream adoption of APIs will become a more mature, stable, sustainable approach to doing business with APIs. Providing the services, tooling, and resources that are needed to make the economy work in the Internet age. This shift in the business of APIs landscape will have positive and negative effects on the API sector, but ultimately working together to move things forward in a more sensible way than we have in the wild west of the API sector. We will als begin to see more standards emerge, and more industry leaders who dominate their sector because they’ve found a sustainable way of doing APIs, that transcends much of the hype we’ve seen, and will continue to see in the startup community.</p>

To prepare, I wanted to work through my thoughts, and make sure each of these answers were on the tip of my tongue–here is one of those questions, along with my thoughts.</em></p>

<p>There are always endless numbers of fabricated unsolved problems in the API space. These are unsolved problems that are usually unsolved because they were just made up to get someone to buy a new service or product. They aren’t real problems. Technology is good at being applied to make believe problems, vendor fabricated problems, and solving real problems created by the last couple of waves of technology. I’d say that biggest unsolved problem is how APIs can actually solve the legacy technical debt challenges large companies, institutions, and government agencies face. There is a lot of rhetoric regarding how APis can unwind all of this, but honestly there are few examples of it in practice. With many API efforts in 2017, bogged down in cultural friction, and a web (pun intended) of technical complexity.</p>

<p>One aspect of this problem of legacy technical debt is the problem of delivering technology in an Internet age, without actually embracing the web. People doing APIs don’t always have the knowledge of the web, and what makes it work before they get to work doing APIs. Vendors are offering up tools and services that provide web API solutions, but don’t always embrace the web, and the existing standards and protocols that make the web work. APIs are the next evolution of the web, and rely on many of the same concepts for it to work. When you ignore the web when doing APIs, you will always face challenges in interoperability, and reuse, and often end up building siloed solutions that do not achieve deliver the solutions that doing APIs have promised.</p>

<p>I regularly see API providers, and service providers delivering their solutions to problems using APIs, with no awareness of the web they are relying on, and the building blocks that make it work. We often see technological solutions that can potentially deliver value, but are done so in a proprietary way, with all roads leading towards a commercial solution, extracting any value from open source implementations, and the web, while not giving anything back. All of this behavior is just leading to the next generation of technical debt, that is being sold as the solution for the last couple of generations of technical debt. When in reality, everyone wants to just operate efficiently, securely, and effectively using the web, but rarely do they ever fully invest in learning what that means, and working with vendors who support this vision.</p>

<p>It is easy to say the biggest unsolved problems are the new ones, but in my opinion, this is lazy. New technology will always become yesterday’s old technology. in the race to adopt each new wave of technological solution it is easy to pass the biggest existing problems off to other folks, and pay attention to the new and shiney technology. This is easy. Yes it just contributes to the problem, and rarely actually provides comprehensive, equitable solutions that will make a difference unwinding the technical debt we’ve already built up. So I tend not to get distracted with the endless waves of made up problems you read about daily. I think the biggest unsolved problem in the space is technical debt, and how we unwind it as we move forward. This isn’t just about adopting new acronyms, phrases, terms, and technology. It is often about deeply considering the why and how we are doing this, and having open conversations about what technology we should be doing, and shouldn’t be doing. Then doing it in small enough chunks that it can be eliminated as soon as it shifts from asset to a liability, and either eliminated or replaced with something that works.</p>

To prepare, I wanted to work through my thoughts, and make sure each of these answers were on the tip of my tongue–here is one of those questions, along with my thoughts.</em></p>

<p>The number API that gets me out of bed each day, with an opportunity to apply what I’ve learned in the API sector is with the Human Services Data API (HSDA). Which is an open API standard I am the technical lead for which helps municipalities, and human service organizations better share information that helps people find services in their communities. This begins with the basics like food, housing, and healthcare, but in recent months I’m seeing the standard get applied in disaster scenarios like Hurricane Irma to help organize shelter information. This is why I do APIs. The project is always struggling for funding, and is something I do mostly for free, with small paychecks whenever we receive grants, or find projects where we can deliver an actual API on the ground.</p>

<p>Next, I’d say it is government APIs at the municipal, state, but mostly at the federal levels. I was a Presidential Innovation Fellow in the Obama administration, helping federal agencies publish their open data assets, take inventory of their web services. I don’t work for the government anymore, but it doesn’t mean the work hasn’t stopped. I’m regularly working on projects to ensure RFPs, and RFIs have appropriate API language in them, and talking with agencies about their API strategy, helping educate them what is going on in the private sector, and often times even across other government agencies. APIs like the new FOIA API, Recreational Information Database API, Regulations.gov, IRS APis, and others will have the biggest impact on our economy and our lives in my opinion, so I make sure to invest a considerable amount of time here whenever I can.</p>

<p>After that, working with API education and awareness at higher educational institutions is one my passions and interest. My partner in crime Audrey Watters has a site called Hack Education, where she covers how technology is applied in education, so I find my work often overlapping with her efforts. A portion of these conversations involve APIs at the institutional level, and working with campus IT, but mostly it about how the Facebook, Twitter, WordPress, Dropbox, Google, and other public APIs can be used in the classroom. My partner and I are dedicated to understanding the privacy implications of technology, and how APIs can be leveraged to give students and faculty more control over their data and content. We work regularly to tell stories, give talks, and conduct workshops that help folks understand what is possible at the intersection of APIs and education.</p>

<p>After that, I’d say the main stream API sector keeps me interested. I’m not that interested in the whole startup game, but I do find a significant amount of inspiration from studying the API pioneers like SalesForce and Amazon, and social platforms like Twitter and Facebook. As well as the cool kids like Twilio, Stripe, and Slack. I enjoy learning from these API leaders, studying their approaches, but where I find the most value is sharing these stories with folks in SMB, SME, and the enterprise. These are the real-world stories I thrive on, and enjoy retelling as part of my work on API Evangelist. I’m a technologist, so the technology of doing APIs can be compelling, and the business of doing this has some interesting aspects, but it’s mostly the politics of doing APIs that intrigues me. This primarily involves the politics of the humans involved within a company, or industry, providing what I always find to be the biggest challenges of doing APIs.</p>

<p>In all of these areas, what actually gets me up each day, is being able to tell stories. I’ve written about 3,000 blog posts on API Evangelist in seven years. I work to publish 3-5 posts each weekday, with some gaps in there due to life getting in the way. I enjoy writing about what I’m learning each day, showcasing the healthy practices I find in my research, and calling out the unhealthy practices I regularly come across. This is one of the reasons I find it so hard to take a regular job in the space, as most companies are looking to impose restrictions, or editorial control over my storytelling. This is something that would lead to me not really wanting to get up each day, and is the number one reason I don’t work in government, resulting in me pushing to make change from the outside-in. Storytelling is the most important tool in my toolbox, and it should be in every API providers as well.</p>

<p>When it comes to the most influential people and companies in the API space that I am keeping an eye on, it always starts with the API pioneers. This begins with SalesForce, eBay, and Amazon. Then it moves into the social realm with Twitter and Facebook. All of these providers are still moving and shaking the space when it comes to APIs, and operating viable API platforms that dominate in their sector. While I do not always agree with the direction these platforms are taking, they continue to provide a wealth of healthy, and bad practices we should all be considering as part of our own API operations, even if we aren’t doing it at a similar scale.</p>

<p>Secondarily, I always recommend studying the cloud giants. Amazon is definitely the leader in this space, with their pioneering, first mover status, but Google is in a close second, and enjoys some API pioneering credentials with Google Maps, and other services in their stack. Even though Microsoft waiting so long to jump into the game I wouldn’t discount them from being an API mover and shaker with their Azure platform making all the right moves in the last couple of years as they played catch up. These three API providers are dictating much of what we know as being APIs in 2017, and will continue to do so in coming years. They will be leading the conversation, as well as sucking the oxygen out of other conversations they do not think are worthy. If you aren’t paying attention to the cloud APIs, you won’t remain competitive, no matter how well you do APIs.</p>

<p>Next, I always recommend you study the cool kids of APIs. Learning about how Twilio, Stripe, SendGrid, Keen, and the other API-first movers and shakers are doing what they do. These platforms are the gold standard when it comes to how you handle the technical, business, and politics of API operations. You can spend weeks in their platforms learning from how they craft their APIs, and operate their communities. These companies are all offering viable resources using web APIs, that developers need. They are offering these resources up in a way that is useful, inviting, and supportive of their consumers. They are actively investing in their API community, keeping in sync with what they are needing to be successful. It doesn’t matter which industry you are operating in, you should be paying attention to these companies, and learning from them on a regular basis.</p>

<p><em>I am spending two days this week with the <a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/">Capital One DevExchange</a> team outside of Washington DC, and they’ve provided me with a list of questions for one of our sessions, which they will be recording for internal use. To prepare, I wanted to work through my thoughts, and make sure each of these answers were on the tip of my tongue–here is one of those questions, along with my thoughts.</em></p>

<p>The biggest challenge for big companies doing APIs is always about people and culture. Change is hard. Decoupling things at large companies is difficult. While APIs can operate at scale, they excel when they do one thing well, and aren’t burdened with the scope, and complexity of much of the software systems we see already operating within large companies. These large systems take large teams of people to operate, and shifting this culture, and displacing these people isn’t going to happen easily. People are naturally skeptical of new approaches, and get very defensive when it comes to their data, content, and other digital assets, as it can be seen as a threat to their livelihood–opening up and sharing these resources outside their sphere of influence.</p>

<p>The culture that has been established at large companies won’t be easily undone. It is a culture that historically has had a pretty large gulf between business groups, and the IT groups who delivered the last generation of APIs (web services), that weren’t meant to be accessible, and understandable by business users. Web APIs have become simpler, more intuitive, and have the potential to be owned, consumed, and even in some cases deployed by business users. Even with this potential, many of the legacy rifts still exist, and business users feel this isn’t their domain, and IT and developer groups often feel APIs are something that should stay in their domain–perpetuating and confusing existing challenges already in place.</p>

<p>While there may be small API success within large companies, they often experience significant roadblocks when they try to scale, or spread to other groups. A huge investment is needed in API training amongst not just business users, but also developer and IT groups who may not have the experience with the web that is needed to make an API program successful. This can be the most costly and time-consuming aspect of doing APIs, and with many APIs being born out of technical groups, and are often under-funded, experimental efforts, investment in the basics of web literacy, and API training is often anemic. Setting the stage for what is happening when you begin unraveling legacy systems and processes is essential to minimize friction across API implementations. Without it, humans and culture will be your biggest obstacles to API success.</p>

<p>Web literacy, and API training really isn’t much different than other areas where corporate training is being applied, but for some reason many companies just expect the technology folks to know what they know already, or problem solve and learn on the job. This might have been find when things got done in purely technical circles, but web APIs aren’t purely about tech. They are about leveraging the web to solve problems people face within a company, getting access to resources, and working with external partners to help move business forward. IT and developer staff aren’t always ready for this type of external facing roles, and if business users aren’t up to speed on what is needed, API implementations will stumble, sputter, and ultimately fail. Think of the partnerships it’s taken to make the web work at your company, everyone is using the web, why should it be different with APIs? If APIs are done right, and people are properly educated, there is no reason an entire group can’t work in concert.</p>

<p>Every API effort I’ve seen fail had one common road block–people. There were IT groups that sabotaged, sales teams that felt threatened, executive leadership who didn’t understand what was happening, or partners who were in proper alignment with API efforts. Sure, sometimes the challenges are purely technical. Lack of proper API design. Insufficient security or capacity. These are simply API training and education issues as well. You can’t throw the need for integration of resources between internal groups, external partners, or 3rd party developers using the web at any technical group and expect them to understand what is needed. Similarly, you can’t mandate APIs across business groups, and just expect them to get on-board without any friction. Invest in the web literacy skills, API training and awareness, and communication skills that will be required to do APIs right, and the chances your API efforts will succeed will greatly increase.</p>

<p><em>I am spending two days this week with the <a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/">Capital One DevExchange</a> team outside of Washington DC, and they’ve provided me with a list of questions for one of our sessions, which they will be recording for internal use. To prepare, I wanted to work through my thoughts, and make sure each of these answers were on the tip of my tongue–here is one of those questions, along with my thoughts.</em></p>

<p>The biggest change in the industry since I started doing API Evangelist in 2010 is who is doing APIs. In 2010 it was 95% startups doing APIs, with a handful of enterprise, and small businesses doing them. I’d say over the last couple years the biggest change is that this had spread beyond the startup community and is something we see across companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies of all shapes and sizes. Granted, there are a variety when it comes to the level they are doing them, and the quality, but APIs are something that has been moving mainstream over the last seven years, and becoming more commonplace in many different industries.</p>

<p>In 2010 it was all about Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, and many of the API pioneers. This has been rapidly shifting to each wave of startups like Twilio, Stripe, Slack, and others. However, now in 2017 I am seeing insurance companies, airlines, car companies, universities, cities, and federal agencies with API programs. I mean, c’mon, Capital One has an API program (wink, wink). While I still hold influence with each wave of API service providers looking to sell to the space, and many of the API startup providers, my main audience is folks on the frontline of the enterprise, and government agencies at all levels. I also have a growing number of people at higher educational institutions tuning into what I’m writing as they look to evolve their approach to technology. APIs were mainly a startup thing in 2010, and in 2017 it is about getting business done in a digital age thing.</p>

<p>The technology of APIs is still expanding and we are seeing things push beyond just REST, and web APIs, but by far the biggest change has been more about the business of doing APIs, and more importantly sometimes, the politics of doing APIs. These are areas of the industry that are rapidly expanding and evolving as new people onboard with the concept of an API, and the opportunity for doing APIs. As we add new companies, organizations, institutions, agencies, and industries to API conversation, the technology of APIs hasn’t shifted to much, but the business and political landscape is flexing, shifting, and evolving at a pretty rapid pace, and it is something that isn’t always a good thing. Along with it comes privacy, security, financial, and other challenges that will only get worse if there isn’t more discussion and collective investment.</p>

<p>The shift I’ve seen between 2010 and 2017, feels a lot like the change I witnessed from 1995 to 2002 with the web, but this time it’s more than just about websites, it is also about mobile applications, devices, conversational interfaces, automation, and much more. Honestly, it is simply just the next evolution of the web, where there is significantly more channels for operating on than just a browser, and there is a growing amount of digital assets being distributed via the web beyond just text, and images. Video has picked up speed, voice and audio are finally maturing, and algorithms, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are seeing a significant uptick. While all of these areas will have their impact, the biggest changes will come from leading industries like healthcare, education, banking, transportation, and others going beyond just dipping their toes in the API space, but baking it into everything they do.</p>

<p><em>I am spending two days this week with the <a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/">Capital One DevExchange</a> team outside of Washington DC, and they’ve provided me with a list of questions for one of our sessions, which they will be recording for internal use. To prepare, I wanted to work through my thoughts, and make sure each of these answers were on the tip of my tongue–here is one of those questions, along with my thoughts.</em></p>

<p>You needed the API Evangelist because there was nobody paying attention to the big picture of the API space. Sure, there are many vendors who pay attention to the big picture, and there are analysts who are paid to pay attention to the bigger picture to help validate the vendors, but there is nobody independent. At least there wasn’t in 2010 when I started. Now, there are a number of leading API experts and visionaries who work at different companies, and are able to maintain an independent view of the space, but in 2010 this did not exist. I’d like to think I helped make such a thing possible, but honestly it probably would have happened without me.</p>

<p>Developer advocates, and evangelists tend to pay attention to a specific API, set of APIs, or API services and tooling. I pay attention to everything. I keep an eye on as many APIs as I possibly can, and work to evaluate all the services, tools, and technology that emerges on the landscape. I try to remain objective about what is working, and what is not, and share stories about both. I still have my biases, and tend to hold grudges against a few companies for their bad behavior, but for the most part I’m just trying to share an honest view of what is going on at the 100K view. Something that differs from the analysts, because I don’t have a vendor driven agenda, I’m just looking to understand.</p>

<p>Another area that I benefit the space is educating the normals about what is going on. I’m priming your customers, and the decision makers who will be buying your products, services, and putting your tooling to work. Not every company is willing to invest heavily in the area of API education beyond their own products and services, and it is something that needs significant investment. I’ve had API service providers thank me for providing articles, white papers, research, and guides they can use to help validate what they are saying. I’m used by newspapers, tech blogs, and ocasionally analysts to validate their own findings and stories about what is going on in the API space. I help API providers and service providers do better, and this is why some companies support me financially by sponsoring my work.</p>

<p>Even with all my work over the last seven years, we need hundreds of more API Evangelists. We need API Evangelist in every industry, and in every country and region. It’s not a model that will scale, and don’t think about going to get some funding to make it happen. We just need other people who care about their sectors, have the capacity to make sense of the technology, while also still be able to explain what is going on to normals, and holding their own with developers and IT folks. You need the API Evangelist because most people are just looking to sell you something, even if they are really nice folks. You need the API Evangelist, because I’m going to look at things with an honest and critical eye that isn’t blinded by what I’m trying to sell you, what my boss’s or investor’s agenda is. Even if that agenda is mostly positive, they will always miss a significant portion of what is going on. I’m where you come to ask questions, and read stories about what is happening, without things being skewed by money. I’m not doing this to get rich, build a startup, exit, or doing anything beyond just making a decent living, and paying my bills.</p>

<p><em>I am spending two days this week with the <a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/">Capital One DevExchange</a> team outside of Washington DC, and they’ve provided me with a list of questions for one of our sessions, which they will be recording for internal use. To prepare, I wanted to work through my thoughts, and make sure each of these answers were on the tip of my tongue–here is one of those questions, along with my thoughts.</em></p>

<p>The idea of an influencer in the API space will mean many things to many different people. I have pretty strong opinions about what an influencer should do, and it is always something that should be as free of product pitches as it possibly can. Influencing someone in the API space should mean that you are not just influencing their decision to buy your product or service. That is sales, which has it’s place, but we are talking about influencing. I would also add that influencing SHOULD NOT be steeped in convincing folks regarding what they should invest in, at the technology purchasing level, all the way up to the venture capital level. The role of an influencer in the API industry should always be about education, awareness, and helping influence how average flks get everyday problems solved.</p>

<p>Being an influencer always begins with listening and learning. We are not broadcasting or pitching, we want to influence, so we need to have an idea about who we are influencing, and what will resonate and help them solve the problems they face. I do a significant portion of this by reading blogs, tuning into Twitter, and spending time on Github understanding what folks are building. Next, I engage in conversations with folks who are doing APIs, looking to understand APIs, and listening to what their challenges are, and what matters to them. At this stage I am not influencing anyone. I am being influenced. I’m absorbing what is going on, educating myself about what the problem set looks like, and better understanding my potential audience, when and if I get around to doing some of that influencing.</p>

<p>With a better understanding of an industry, a specific audience, and potentially the problems and challenges faced with doing APIs, I will usually step back from APIs entirely. I want to better understand the industry outside of just doing APIs. I want to understand the companies, organizations, instutions, and potentially government influence on what is happening. Everything that is already going on often weighs on doing APIs way more than the technology will ever by itself. I’m looking to understand the business and politics of operating in any sector before I will ever begin doing any sort of influencing within an industry, and to any specific audience. In technology circles, I find that many of us operate within silos, with our blinders on, and don’t always understand the scope of the problem we are looking to provide API solutions for. Stepping back is always healthy.</p>

<p>Once I’ve done my research, engaged in conversations with folks in an area I’m looking to influence, I’ll begin to write stories on the blog. This is all just exercising and training for the white papers, guides, workshops and talks I will be giving in any area I’m trying to influence. I will do this for months, repeating, reworking my ideas, and developing my understanding. The process usually brings more people out of the woodworks, opening up even more conversations, and influencing my industry, but also potentially adding to the number of folks I will be influencing. Slowly I will build the knowledge and awarness needed to truly be able to influence people in any industry, ensuring I have the platform of knowledge I will need, and grasp the scope of the challenges and problems we will be looking to deliver API solutions for.</p>

<p>The role of an API influencer is always a two-way street. You should be influenced just as much, or more than you are influencing. You should be working with influencers to understand your challenges. Tell us your stories, even if they are confidental. Help us understand your industries, and the unique problems and challenges that exist in there. Invest in us listening to your stories, and us telling your story on our blogs, and other longer form content. This is how we’ll help work through what is going on, and find the right path for your API journey. We can bring a lot of value to your API operations, and help you work through the challenges you face. This isn’t about content creation, or simply workshops, training, white papers, and public speaking. This is about influencing, and making an impact. You can’t do this without truly knowing what is going on, and being able to intelligently speak what is going on. This takes time, practice, investment, and actually giving a shit. It is something not everyone can pull off.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/36349140070_d5ec39cb34_z.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p><em>I am spending two days this week with the <a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/">Capital One DevExchange</a> team outside of Washington DC, and they’ve provided me with a list of questions for one of our sessions, which they will be recording for internal use. To prepare, I wanted to work through my thoughts, and make sure each of these answers were on the tip of my tongue–here is one of those questions, along with my thoughts.</em></p>

<p>A couple weeks back I spent the entire week ranting on API Evangelist, instead of my usual lineup of API stories. Normally these types of stories end up on KinLane.com, or my rants edition, and usually don’t get tweeted out. I’m just venting. However on this particular week, I had enough people “piss in my cheerios”, that I felt the space needed to hear my rants, instead of the usual “nice guy” tone I tend to take on here. Granted, I can be pretty outspoken and blunt in my storytelling, but I usually work very hard to keep a professional tone, and be as nice as I possibly can. There are plenty of assholes in the API space, and I really don’t want to be one of them–even though it comes pretty naturally for me. ;-)</p>

<p>I actually got tired of the tone by mid-week, but I had so many people Tweet, email, and post on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Slack that they were enjoying the rants, I kept it going until that Friday. I was moving to New York, and really didn’t have much time to do the normal amount of research it takes to write stories, and the rants were an easy want to get content up that took me about 10 minutes to write. So why did people like the posts? First, I have to say that not everyone did. I heard from a number of other people that thought I was being a diva, and found the tone offensive. I also heard from a number of folks who were concerned for my mental state, and made sure they checked in on me. So, there were a number of emotions shared, but overwhelmingly people did find it worthwhile.</p>

<p>I feel that people enjoyed it because I was speaking truth in an environment where not many folks do. You see most people have jobs, bosses, and investors. I do not. Few people want to get in trouble with their boss and lose their job. If you run a startup you don’t want to piss off your investors, and lose your funding, or not be able to get funding when you are seeking it, because you said the wrong thing. I’d say these are the top two reasons. Sure, there are other reasons, like you might not get invited to te right events, or be able to hang out with the cool kids, but money is the number one reason people don’t speak the truth on a day to day basis. This is how the world keeps people in line, is with the purse strings. Honestly, most of it isn’t direct, it is self-filtering, where people just perceive there will be repercussions, and they just keep things quiet, and do not rock the boat.</p>

<p>People look to me to not bullshit them in API space. Sell them unneeded products and services, and tell them make believe marketing stories. They are used to me speaking my mind, and being honest about what I’m seeing. I’m not going to be pushing a product, service, or company I don’t agree with just because I was given money. I’m going to be honest about each wave of technology that comes along. I’m also going to call out the everyday bullshit and games we all encounter, but are forced to keep playing to keep our jobs, and get that next round of investment. I’m always amazed at how people change over time when they get to know me, begin to lower their barriers, and realize I’m not going to screw them over, take their ideas, or sell them something they don’t need, simply because they are in my sales funnel, or because I need to make my numbers. I don’t think people realize how puckered up they are on a daily basis from all the stuff we are bombarded with.</p>

<p>Even when you do find rants or seemingly truth speakers online, most people know they have an agenda. I was just ranting because my bullshit levels had overflowed, and enough people had pissed me off. I really don’t think I’m going to change much with my rants, I was just blowing off steam. I think people enjoy an agenda-less ranty story everyone once in awhile. In a world where everything is awesome, and each wave of technology is revolutionary, some folks just want the real deal, no bullshit coating. Much of what I’m saying is what all y’all are thinking anyways. You just don’t get to say it, so you enjoy hearing me say it. My ability to be able to write this way comes from many years of having a job, mortgage, boss, investors, and a wife, where I had to keep my mouth shut. Now I have none of those things, and I have a hot girlfriend who is rantier than I am, but in a way smarter way than I could ever hope to be. So, why not. Speak truth. I mean there is a lot of fake out there these days, it feels good to just tell it like it is.</p>

<p><em>I am spending two days this week with the <a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/">Capital One DevExchange</a> team outside of Washington DC, and they’ve provided me with a list of questions for one of our sessions, which they will be recording for internal use. To prepare, I wanted to work through my thoughts, and make sure each of these answers were on the tip of my tongue–here is one of those questions, along with my thoughts.</em></p>

<p>In the spring of 2010 I was ready for a career shift. I was running North American event for SAP, and had also taken up running events for Google, which included Google I/O and Developer Days. I was the VP of Technology, and made all the decisions around usage of tech, from email blasts, to registration, session scanning, and follow-up reporting. When I took over the role I was dealing with a literal hostage colocation facility for server infrastructure, and massive hardware expenditure on servers that I didn’t need most of the year. Then in 2007 I began using the Amazon Cloud, and got to work re-engineering systems to be more API-centric, leverage AWS APIs to orchestrate my operations.</p>

<p>By 2007 I had been playing around with web APIs for some time. I had incorporated payment and shipping APIs into commerce systems, and integrated Flickr, Delicious, Twitter, Facebook and other APIs into applications. I had plenty of SOAP web service experience when it came to enterprise infrastructure, but this was the first time I was deploying global infrastructure at scale using web APIs. I realized that web APIs weren’t just hobby toys, as my SAP IT director in Germany called them, they were an actual a tool I could use to operate a business at scale. My success resulted in more work, taking on more events, and scaling operations, which didn’t always pencil out to me actually being happier, even though the events scaled more efficiently, and out-performed what had come before.</p>

<p>The two Google I/O events where I managed the technology were the first ones where Google gave away their new Android mobile phones. I saw first hand what was happening in the mobile market, with the growth of the iPhone, and everyone scrambling to deploy APIs to support the new applications their were developing. Now, I was also beginning to develop new APIs to support what was possible via Android devices. It was clear that web APIs were going to be the preferred way to deliver the resources needed on mobile phones, and by 2010 there was no doubt that this mobile thing was going to be around for a while. Both SAP and Google were pushing on us to deliver resources that could be used on mobile platforms across all the events we were managing, and I saw that web APIs were how we would do this at scale.</p>

<p>I was using web APIs to deliver compute, storage, and other essential infrastructure to support global events. I was also using web APis to deliver resources to iPhone applications, and now Android applications. I wanted to better understand how this was being done, so in 2010 I began studying the world of APIs, looking at the common approaches to delivering APIs. I quickly saw there were plenty of pundits discussing the technical details of doing APIs, and I decided that I would focus on the business of doing APIs, and specifically how I can help convince business leaders to understand the potential. By summer of 2010 I had settled in on the name of my research blog, and by October I was beginning to publish my research on the blog. Seven years later, 3,000 blog posts later, I’m still doing it, and enjoy the focus on this important layer of not just the web, cloud, and mobile, but how APIs are being used in devices, on the network, and for bots, voices, and other conversational applications.</p>

<p>I wrote an piece earlier today about not fearing AI, but possessing a significant amount of concern when it comes to the people behind. I figured I’d continue with the trend on this Friday afternoon, and talk about the coming regulations when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and everything cognitive, intelligent, and algorithmic. I am not fully a believer in regulations being the only solution, but I know they are the solutions that bigcos tend to pay attention to. Which is why they spend so much money to distort, and bend them to what they want to see in their industries.</p>

<p>We are entering a phase of the Internet where there are going to an increased number of calls for regulations. Whether it’s privacy, security, breaches, or specifically on technology like drones, artificial intelligence, bots, and machine learning, expect more government involvement in the future. This isn’t because government is inheriently bad, and is looking to suffocate business, it is primarily because these areas of technology are being defined by the worst among us. When you bundle with the not so bad folks, and even many of the good folks refusing to reign in their industry partners, and fellow technologists, you end up with more regulations imposed to stablize things. If the tech space was more willing to step up and take the lead regarding acceptable practices, this wouldn’t be necessary.</p>

<p>Algorithms are making more decisions in our lives. After seeing what Facebook and Twitter have done during the last US election, and seeing AI and ML continue being applied to important aspects of our lives, there will be more inquirires by the government, and calls for the government to step in. I know that platforms don’t want to be regulated, and with very libertarian stances in much of Silicon Valley, there is a significant undertow of anti-regulatory, and anti-government sentiment. However, if you believe in the wisdom of the crowds, you have to acknowledge your role in determining how the crowds behave. You are developing the platforms that we can automate with bots. You are providing the platforms for deploying the next generation of AI and ML. In many cases, these existing tech players are also investing in the next wave of startups. If you don’t set the tone for what acceptable practices are, the federal government eventually will.</p>

<p>When this happens I’m going to be here to point at APIs as one possible regulatory solution. I’m going to have years of blog posts on the subject, with plenty of evidence about how APIs, and API management can be provide observability into how platforms, and algorithms operate. I’m not doing this because this is the future I want. I’m doing this because this is the future you all have set the stage for. I get that you don’t want to reign in your startup co-founders, trusted partners, or investors. The system is designed to punish you if you do. However, if you let the worst of the worst lead the conversation when it comes to AI, ML, algorithms, and other tech trends, regulations will be the only answer. So, put on your seatbelt, and get ready for the government stepping up to dictate the rules of the road, because it seems to be the only thing many of you will actually respond to, whether you like it or not.</p>

<p>Our team at a hackathon I’m participating in this week is working on a data aggregation tool for helping merge multiple hurrican shelter data sources from Irma in Florida. While the need for the data is winding down, the use case for the tool could be something that lives on, and could help communities in the future. This projects aggregates multiple data sources for shelters from FEMA, municipal, and sources pulled together by volunteers. Our team is focused on aggregating, and doing as much heavy lifting to  automatically merge and cleanse the data as they can, but then at the right moment render it for humans to step in and finish the work.</p>

<p>I was impressed with the balance struck by the team. Knowing where to apply technology, and when to rely on humans. The problem of merging open data from multiple sources is a big and complex one. It is one that I’ve seen many technologists think they can step up and solve simply with their tech toolbox, no humans necessary. Our team quickly saw the scope of the program, discussed at length about what they could accomplish, and what they couldn’t accomplish, then got to work in the code to deliver the functionality, but then also developed a web interface to allow humans to step in at just the right point. Striking a balance between the human and technological aspects of doing this–which is what the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) is all about.</p>

<p>I know there is a significant amount of information out there about User Experience (UX), and also increasingly Developer Experience (DX). However, I think skills to know where to apply technology, and when to step back from using it, and focusing on augmenting, empowering, and putting the humans in charge are seriously deficient in our sector. I regularly encounter developers who think that technology is the solution, and humans are the problem. This contempt always degrades the amount of investment in the user interface portion of the question, and will also shift the developer experience portion, ensuring the API speaks to the technological needs, and not the human needs. This isn’t how all of this should work. It isn’t about the tech. It is about what the technology does for humans, not the other way around</p>

<p>The balance of API backend to human front end on this week’s human services hackathon was refreshing to see. Early on I saw the team leaning towards trying to merge, clean up, and solve all the data problems in the code, and I was a little concerned. However, by the end of the 2nd night they showed me their API definition and design, as well as the web interface meant for humans. I felt they struck a perfect balance between the tech and human aspects of delivering human services. This balance is a topic you will here more about here on the blog as I talk about APIs, and how they are being wielded for artificial intelligence, machine learning, voice, bots, and every other digital layer of our world that often seems to be being consumed by technology. I’m always looking for the emphasis of human over the technology, and I am pleased with the outcome of this hackathon. I’ll showcase the work once we are done. It is something I’m thinking will be useful in supporting future natural disasters, something I’m feeling is going to become a more common occurrence in our world.</p>

<p>There is a lot of FUD out there when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). The tech press enjoy yanking people’s chain when it comes to the dangers of artificial intelligence. AI is coming for your jobs. AI is racist, sexist, and biased. AI will be lead to World War III. AI will secure and protect us from the bad out there. AI will be the source of all of our worries, and the solution to all of our worries. I’m interested in the storytelling around all of this, and I’m fascinated by the distracting quality of technology when it comes to absolving the humans behind of doing bad things.</p>

<p>We have the technology to make this black boxes more observability and accountable. The algorithms feeding us news, judging us in courtrooms, and deciding if we are insurable or a risk, can all be wrapped with APIs, and made more accountable. However, there are many human reasons why we don’t do this. Every AI out there can be held accountable, it isn’t rocket science. The technology exists to keep AI from hurting us, judging us, and impacting our lives in negative ways. However, it is the people behind who do not want it, otherwise their stories won’t work. Their stories won’t have the desired effect and control over our lives.</p>

<p>APIs are the layer being wielded for good and for bad on the Internet. Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit, all leverage APIs to be available on our mobile phones. APIs are how people automate, advertise, and fund their activities on their platforms. APIs are how AI and ML are being exposed, wielded, and leveraged. The technology is already there to make them more accountable, we just don’t have the human will to use the technology we have. There is more money to be made in telling wild stories about what is possible. Telling stories that make folks afraid, and in awe of what is possible with technology. APIs are used to tell you the stories, while also making the fire shoot from the stage, and the smoke and the mirrors operate, instead of helping us see, understand, and verify what is going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>We rarely discuss the fact that AI isn’t coming for our jobs. It is the people behind the AI, at the companies developing, deploying, and operating AI that are coming for our jobs. AI, like APIs, are neither good, nor bad, nor neutral–they are a tool. They are technology, and anything they do is because of us humans. I don’t fear AI. I only fear the people doing AI. The people who tell the stories. The people who are believers. I don’t fear technology because I know we have the tools to do what is right, and hold the people who are using technology in bad ways accountable. I’m afraid because we don’t seem to have the will to look behind the curtain. We hold up many of the people telling stories about AI as visionaries, leaders, and truth tellers. I don’t fear AI, I only fear its followers.</p>

<p><a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat/program/schedule">We are putting the finishing touches on the schedule for APIStrat in Portland, OR, October 31st through November 2nd</a>. We have all the workshops, sessions, and keynotes dialed in (not all keynotes announced, wink, wink), and it is all just about making sure y’all show up and participate in the conversation. This is my 2nd favorite part of the event, the build-up for the big day(s). This is the 8th APIStrat we’ve done, and it is the first one we’ve done as part of the Linux Foundation, and with the OpenAPI Initiative. I’m excited.</p>

<p><a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat/program/schedule">Make sure and take a look at the session schedule</a>. We received over 165 submissions, and had a program committee of almost 30 people vote to decide with 60 would be accepted. I am the program chair and helped make some difficult decisions, but ultimately I”m pretty proud of the lineup we’ve pulled together. It’s much of the same popular topics as you’ve seen at previous events, with new faces, and brands, but there is also some of the leading edge conversations around serverless, gRPC, GraphQL. Of course, there is also going to be a lot of talk about OpenAPI, in workshops, sessions, and on the main stage. So check out the schedule if you haven’t, it’s pretty sweet lineup.</p>

<p>I want to personally thank <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>, Stoplight, <a href="https://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a>, <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>, <a href="https://developer.capitalone.com/">CapitalOne DevExchange</a>, <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC</a>, <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google</a>, and <a href="http://www.cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a> for <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat/sponsors/our-sponsors">sponsoring and making sure APIStrat happens</a>. Of course, thank you to <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/">The Linux Foundation</a>, and the <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI Initiative (OAI)</a> for taking the lead on APIStrat as it continues to grow and mature with the API community. I want to also thank my partner in crime, Steve Willmott, and the 3Scale / Red Hat team–without them APIStrat wouldn’t be a thing.</p>

<p>Next up for me, now that the schedule is dialed in. Is to just tell stories about what will be happening. I’m going to go through each of the speakers, and companies who are present and look to see what they are up to with APIs. It is something I always try to do in the final months of build up to the conference. APIStrat has been an important part of how I learn about what is going on with APIs, and who the interesting companies, and people are. Hopefully it is the same for you, and we can both be there in November, and learn what is going on together. It will be my first event where I’m not giving a talk. ;-) I’ll still be MC’ing, and harassing y’all in the hallways, but I’m looking forward to being able to tune into more of the talks as they occur.</p>

<p>I’m participating in a hackathon in Princeton, New Jersey as part of <a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">my work on the Human Services Data API (HSDA)</a>. We are at a large enterprise financial group’s office, as part of a three day social good hackathon / code sprint. Everybody participating is taking time off from their normal day job as back-end or front-end programmer, and business analyst, to build something for the greater good. Since it is an enterprise developer group the concept of a hackathon is somewhat new to them, and is the first time they’ve worked on external projects, instead of an internally focused hackathon event.</p>

<p>I’m enjoying watching the two teams working on human services projects be forced out of their bubble. One of the projects has three separate 3rd party APIs to work with. 1) Simple spreadsheet deployed web API, 2) government agency published web API, and 3) HSDA API operated by a municipal organization. I am sitting here watching them get exposed to the variety of implementations, quality of data and interface, and wrestle with establishing their project requirements. After being pulled from their bubble trying to understand the APIs, they are also finding themselves pulled out of their local development world, having to potentially use 3rd party tools, services, and even reverse engineering a library or codebase in a language they are not familiar with.</p>

<p>This is all very, very healthy. No matter what gets built at this hackathon, the fact that they are being pulled out of their bubbles, will benefit their world. They are thinking outside their governance bubble. They are forced to learn about the API best or worst practices of other organizations. They are having to use services, tools, and programming languages they aren’t familiar with. All with the motivation of potentially building something for good. They are exercising their skills and knowledge in ways that they won’t encounter in the routine, and highly structured worlds they exist in. Another layer of all of this is that a portion of the team members are from an external group, and have never even met in person–I just watched two of them introduce themselves, and make the connection that they’ve worked together on many projects, but never met in person. #win</p>

<p>This isn’t just startup style thinking for a hackathon. The objective of this event is to build on top of existing tooling, improve existing processes, and add value to existing non-profit organizations. Even with these objectives, the most value is the exhaust from the conversations, planning, and what folks are learning along the way. Also, getting these folks out of their bubble tackling meaningful problems, pulling them away from their routine, and feeling like they are making a change. The hackathon format is part of this, but the API(s) are really a catalyst for change, and a vehicle for helping pull folks out of their carefully crafted environments. The APIs are helping these enterprise developers, project managers, and business analysts think differently, and consider other approaches to getting things done. Hopefully something that will stick with them in the future.</p>

<p>I got on the New York Subway today heading for Penn Station to catch a train (New Jersey Transit) out to Princeton for a hackathon. As I was navigating my way through Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) and the New Jersey Transit I was thinking about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/17/testing-out-the-concept-of-api-transit-instead-of-api-lifecycle/">my usage of API transit instead of API lifecycle</a>. The number one response I had to this concept from readers was in regards the cognitive load experienced when you first look at a subway map that represents API infrastructure, and would anyone even know what I was talking about.</p>

<p>It’s true, when you first look at any of the API subway maps I’ve created so far, you scratch your head to figure out what they mean. I haven’t spent a lot of time making them coherent, but I am also just getting going with the work. Truthfully, they’ll get more complicated, over getting simpler. However, each time I first use the subway in NYC there is also a pretty significant cognitive load. I’ve ridden the subway many times, but each time I still have to study the map, learn the portion I need to get what I need done, and accept that much of it I won’t actually ever understand. I usually only learn what applies to me, and the more time I spend riding a transit system, the more time it comes into focus–something that applies to any transit system in the world I’ve used.</p>

<p>Think about when you start a new job, or adopt an existing legacy project as an API product manager. You do not immediately understand all the moving parts, absorb any diagrams, or documentation the first time you look at them. It takes time experiencing a system, before you will get acquainted, and become a local, like someone riding the MTA or NJT transit systems. Now that I live in NYC I’m going to spend time learning the transit system so I can get around, but I’m also going to invest energy learning it from an operators perspective, and understand the challenges they are facining maintaining, evolving, and keeping the system usable for users. I’m sure there will be a wealth of analogies in there for me when it comes to IT and API infrastructure.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m pretty lost on the MTA and NJT transit systems, but it’s slowly coming into focus. A significant piece of this is the maps that are available to me. Also the physical display systems available to me in the stations, as well as online, and on my mobile phone. I’m pushing forward the next generation of my API Subway MAP tooling at the same time. I’m creating a simple Siren-defined, Jekyll-driven, Github hosted map that helps me walk through a variety stops along the API lifecycle, along a handful of “lines” from design, to deployment, testing, and security. We’ll see how well I do bridging these concepts, but I’m hopeful that eventually it will come into focus, and I’ll stop being so lost, and develop a better understanding of what is going on.</p>

<p>I am investing more time into <a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/">my Schema.org work</a>, alongside my learning about OpenAPI 3.0. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/09/12/my-favorite-part-of-openapi-30-is-the-components-object/">I’m pretty excited about the components object</a>, and I want to push forward some of my Schema.org dictionary ideas, to help folks get better at reusing common schema throughout their work. <a href="http://Schema.org">Schema.org</a> is the most robust vocabulary out there, and we shouldn’t be reinventing the wheel in this area. I know the most important reason that folks aren’t using is that they either don’t know about it, or they are just lazy. I figure if I create some ready to go schema in an OpenAPI 3.0 components object, maybe people will be more inclined to put common schema to use.</p>

<p>To share my components I need basic OpenAPI 3.0 shell to hold all my reusable schema. I really don’t care about the paths, and other elements being their. <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/edit/OpenAPI.next/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml">So I headed over to the OpenAPI 3.0 Github repo and borrowed the sample Petstore OpenAPI 3.0 my friend Darrel Miller created</a>:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/43934f44fd591a6ee59a45267d9e3066.js"></script>

<p>I will change all the information in this sample to reflect my work, but I figured before I did I would share this example document with my readers. At first glance it doesn’t look much different than version 2.0 of OpenAPI, but once you start studying you see the differences. You see the responses have JSON specific content types inserted in between their schema references. There is also a components object, with a couple of schema present–this is all I need. There are a bunch of other things you can store in your components object, but I think this provides a nice first look at what is going on.</p>

<p>If you are looking for some other working examples of OpenAPI 3.0 in action, <a href="https://github.com/Mermade/openapi3-examples/tree/master/pass/OAI">head over to Mike Ralphson’s repository</a>, he has some additional ones you can play with. I don’t know about you, but I learn from others. I need to reverse engineer API definitions from other people before I become fluent myself. I’m going to spend some time hand-crafting some OpenAPI 3.0 definitions, so that I become more fluent. It is tedious work when you are just getting going, but once you get it down, it becomes like any other language you use. I’m hoping to cut my teeth on this Schema.org work. I’m going to replicate the OpenAPI 2.0 work I did when I created over a 1,000 OpenAPIs for each of the Schema.org objects. I’m going to be using them to deploy APIs for clients, and in my API training and storytelling. I want all my examples to be reuable patterns that already exist, not anything custom that I pull out of my magic arse.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kubernetes/kubernetes-json-schema.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’ve been doing my regular trolling of Github lately, looking for anything interesting. <a href="https://github.com/garethr/kubernetes-json-schema">I came across a repository this week that contained JSON Schema for Kubernetes</a>. Something that is interesting by itself, but I also thought the fact that they had autogenerated the individual JSON Schema files from the Kubernetes OpenAPI was worth a story. It demonstrates for me, the growing importance of schema in all of this, and shows that having them readily available on Github is becoming more important for API providers and consumers.</p>

<p>Creating schema is an important aspect of crafting an OpenAPI, but I find that many API providers, or the consumers who are creating OpenAPIs and publishing them to Github are not always investing the time into making sure the definitions, or schema portion of them are complete. Another aspect, as Gareth Rushgrove, the author of the Github repo where I found these Kubernetes schema points out, is the JSON Schema in OpenAPI often leaves much to be desired. Until version 3.0 it hasn’t supported everything you need, and many of the ways you are going to use these schema aren’t going to be able to use them in an OpenAPI, and you will need them as individual schema files like Gareth has done.</p>

<p>I just published the latest version of the OpenAPI for <a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">my Human Services Data API (HSDA) work</a>, and one of the things I’ve done is extracted the JSON Schema into separate files so I can use them in schema validation, and other services and tooling I will be using throughout the API lifecycle. I’ve setup an API that automatically extracts and generates them from the OpenAPI, but I’m also creating a Github repo that does this automatically for any OpenAPI I publish into the data folder for the Github repository. This way all I have to do is publish an OpenAPI, and there is automatically a page that tells me how complete or incomplete my schema are, as well as generates individual representations that I can use independent of the OpenAPI.</p>

<p>I am hoping this is the beginning of folks investing more into getting their schema act together. I’m also hoping this is something that OpenAPI 3.0 will help us focus on more as well. Pushing API designers, architects, and developers to get their schema house in order, and publish them not just as OpenAPI, but individual JSON Schema, so they can be used independently. I’m investing more cycles into helping folks learn about <a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a> as I’m pushing my own awareness forward, and will be creating more tooling, training material, and stories that help out on this front. I’m a big fan of OpenAPI, and defining our APIs, but as an old database guy I’m hoping to help stimulate the schema side of the equation, which I think is often just as important.</p>

<p>I’ve written about <a href="https://www.versioneye.com/">VersionEye</a> a couple of times. They help you monitor the 3rd party code you use, keeping an eye on dependencies, license violations, and security issues. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/01/api-sdk-licensing-notifications-using-versioneye/">I’ve written about the license portion of this equation</a>, but they came up again while doing my API security research, and I wanted to make sure I revisited what they were up to in this aspect of the API lifecycle, floating them up on my radar.</p>

<p>VersionEye is keeping an eye on multiple security databases and helps you monitor the SDKs you are using in your application. Inversely, if you are an API provider generating SDKs for your API consumers to put to use, it seems like you should be proactively leverage VersionEye to help you be the eye on the security aspects of your SDK management. They even help developers within their existing CI/CD workflows, which is something that you should be considering as you plan, craft, and support your APIs. Making it as easy for you to leverage your APIs SDKs in your own workflow, and doing the same for your consumers, while also paying attention to security at each step, breaking your CI/CD process when security is breached.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/09/open-sourcing-your-api-like-version-eye/">I also wrote about how VersionEye has open sourced their APIs</a> a while back, highlighting how you can also deploy into any environment you desire. I’m fascinated by the model VersionEye provides for the API space. They are offering valuable services that help us manage our crazy worlds, with a viable commercial and open source offering, that integrates with your existing CI/CD workflow. Next, I’m going to study the dependency portion of what VersionEye offer, then take some time to better understand their business model and pricing. VersionEye is pretty close to what I like to see in a service provider. They don’t have all the shine of a brand new startup, but they have all the important elements that really matter.</p>

<p>I am continuing my learning about Webhooks, and <a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/">Github keeps my notebook full with interesting building blocks we can use when crafting our own webhook strategies</a>. I’m not using everything I’m learning from Github in my current strategy, but I like adding each of these building blocks to my <a href="http://webhooks.apievangelist.com/">webhook research</a>, so that I can use in future guides that I publish. Today’s post overlaps two areas of my research into webhooks, and how headers are being used by a variety of API providers.</p>

<p>Github is using HTTP headers as part of the webhook response, providing the recipients of webhooks with more information about what is happening with each outgoing request. They are providing three custom headers along with each payload:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>X-GitHub-Event</strong> - Name of the event that triggered this delivery.</li>
  <li><strong>X-Hub-Signature</strong> - HMAC hex digest of the payload, using the hook’s secret as the key (if configured).</li>
  <li><strong>X-GitHub-Delivery</strong> - Unique ID for this delivery.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these three custom headers, the User-Agent for the requests will have the prefix GitHub-Hookshot–so that your systems can identify these incoming requests more specifically. I like getting the name of the event, and definitely like the example of using the signature to make sure the payload hasn’t been tampered with, or from an untrustworthy source. Additionally you get a unique identifier for the delivery, allowing you to be able to record, and pull up unique webhook receipts.</p>

<p>I’m adding these all as building blocks to my webhook research. I still have a notebook full of other Github, Stripe, Twilio, and leading approaches to webhooks. Once I get through this round I’m going to apply what I’ve learned to the project I’m working on, and then see about pushing out the first draft of my webhooks guide–something I’ve never done before. If nothing else, I’m learning a lot. I’m learning from all the leaders in the space, who are several versions into their webhook designs. I’m finding the biggest challenge right now, is how I hold back and don’t do everything, keeping my webhook designs simple, intuitive, but as powerful as possible.</p>

<p>Every aspect of my business runs as either YAML or JSON. This blog post is YAML stored on Github, viewed as HTML using Jekyll. All the companies, services, tooling, building blocks, patents, and other components of my research all live as YAML on Github. Any API I design is born, and lives as an OpenAPI YAML document on Github. Sure, much of this will be imported, exported, and exported with a variety of other tools, but the YAML and JSON definition is key to every stop along the life cycle of my business, and the work that I do.</p>

<p>It isn’t just me. I’m seeing a big shift in how many platforms, services, and tooling operate, with often times YAML, and still in many situations it has JSON, XML, and CSV at its core. Everything you do should have some sort of schema definition, providing you with a template that you can reuse, share, collaborate, and communicate around. Platforms should allow for the creation of these template schema, and enable the exporting, and importing of them, opening up interoperability, and cross-platform functionality–much like APIs do in real-time using HTTP. This is what OpenAPI has done for the API lifecycle, and there should be many complementary, or even competing formats that accomplish the same, but for specific industries, and use cases.</p>

<p>You can see this in action over at AWS, <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/alexa/post/d362a0ab-61f3-4b17-9fb7-1ad12f39496e/export-your-amazon-lex-bot-schema-to-use-in-your-alexa-skill">with the ability to export your Lex bot schema for use in your Alexa skill</a>. Sure, this is interoperability on the same platform, but it does provide one example of how YAML and JSON definitions can help use share, reuse, and develop common templates for not just APIs, but also the clients, tooling, and other platforms we are engaging with. You’ll see this expand to every aspect of tech as continuous integration and deployment takes root, and Github continues it’s expansion beyond startups, into the enterprise, government, and other institutions. Along the way there will be a lot of no name schema finding success, but we will also need a lot more standardization and maturing as we’ve seen with OpenAPI, for all of this to work.</p>

<p>I hear a lot of grumbling from folks when it comes to YAML. I get it, I had the same feeling. It also reminds me of how I felt about JSON when it first emerged. However, I find YAML to be very liberating of brackets, slashes, and other delimiters, but I also find it is just one format, and I should always be supporting JSON, XML, and CSV when it comes to one dimensional schema. I don’t find it a challenge to convert between the formats, or keep some things one-dimensional to bridge to my spreadsheet oriented users. I actually feel it helps me think outside of my bubble. I enjoy rifling through the YAML and JSON templates I find on Github from a variety of operations, defining their bots, conversational interfaces, visualizations, CI/CD, configuration, clients, and other aspects of operations. Even if I’m never using them, I find it interesting to learn how others define what they are up to.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/Mermade/awesome-openapi3"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/mike-ralphson/openapi_awesome1.png" align="right" width="35%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I’ve been setting aside time to browse through and explore tagged projects on Github each week, learning about what is new and trending out there on the Githubz. It is a great way to explore what is being built, and what is getting traction with users. You have to wade through a lot of useless stuff, but when I come across the gems it is always worth it. I’ve been providing guidance to all my customers that they should be publishing their projects to Github, as well as tagging them coherently, so that they come up as part of tagged searches via the Github website, and the API (I do a lot of discovery via the API).</p>

<p>When I am browsing API projects on Github I usually have a couple of orgs and users I tend to peek in on, and my friend Mike Ralphson (<a href="https://twitter.com/PermittedSoc">@PermittedSoc</a>) is always one. Except, I usually don’t have to remember to peek in on Mike’s work, because he is really good at tagging his work, and building interesting projects, so his stuff is usually coming up as I’m browsing tags. <a href="https://github.com/Mermade/awesome-openapi3">He is the first repository I’ve come across that is organizing OpenAPI 3.0 tooling</a>, and on his project he has some great advice for project owners: “Why not make your project discoverable by using the topic <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=topic%3Aopenapi3&amp;type=Repositories&amp;ref=advsearch&amp;l=&amp;l=">openapi3 on GitHub</a> and using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23openapi3">#openapi3</a> on social media?” « Great advice Mike!!</p>

<p>As I said, I regularly monitor Github tags, and I also monitor a variety of hashtags on Twitter for API chatter. If you aren’t tagging your projects, and Tweeting them out with appropriate hashtags, the likelihood they are going to be found decreases pretty significantly. This is how Mike will find your OpenAPI 3.0 tooling for inclusion in his catalog, and it is how I will find your project for inclusion in stories via API Evangelist. It’s a pretty basic thing, but it is one that I know many of you are overlooking because you are down in the weeds working on your project, and even when you come up for air, you probably aren’t always thinking about self-promotion (you’re not a narcissist like me, or are you?)</p>

<p>Twitter #hashtags has long been a discovery mechanism on social media, but the tagging on Github is quickly picking up steam when it comes to coding project discovery. Also, with the myriad of ways in which Github repos are being used beyond code, Github tagging makes it a discovery tool in general. When you consider how API providers are publishing their API portals, documentation, SDKs, definitions, schema, guides, and much more, it makes Github one of the most important API discovery tools out there, moving well beyond what ProgrammableWeb or Google brings to the table. I’ll continue to turn up the volume on what is possible with Github, as it is no secret that I’m a fan. Everything I do runs on Github, from my website, to my APIs, and supporting tooling–making it a pretty critical part of what I do in the API sector.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#componentsObject"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/openapi/openapi-30-components-object.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>There were a number of changes made to the structure of Open API in the move to version 3.0 that I am a fan of, but if I had to point at a single seismic shift that I think will move the conversation forward it is <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#componentsObject">the components object</a>. According to the specification the components object, “holds a set of reusable objects for different aspects of the OAS. All objects defined within the components object will have no effect on the API unless they are explicitly referenced from properties outside the components object.” It is the store for for all the common and reusable aspects of defining, and designing your APIs–which will have huge benefits on how we are doing all of this.</p>

<p>Here is the laundry list of what you can put into your OpenAPI 3.0 components object, and reference throughout your API definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>schemas</strong> - An object to hold reusable data schema used across your definitions.</li>
  <li><strong>responses</strong> - An object to hold reusable responses, status codes, and their references.</li>
  <li><strong>parameters</strong> - An object to hold reusable parameters you are using throughout your API requests.</li>
  <li><strong>examples</strong> - An object to hold reusable the examples of requests and responses used in your design.</li>
  <li><strong>requestBodies</strong> - An object to hold reusable the bodies that will be sent with your API request.</li>
  <li><strong>headers</strong> - An object to hold reusable headers that define the HTTP structure of your requests.</li>
  <li><strong>securitySchemes</strong> - An object to hold reusable security definitions that protect your API resources.</li>
  <li><strong>links</strong> - An object to hold reusable links that get applied to API requests, moving it towards hypermedia.</li>
  <li><strong>callbacks</strong> - An object to hold reusable callbacks that can be applied.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/07/31/you-see-duplicate-work-while-i-see-common-patterns/">I’ve written about how many API developers see this stuff as duplicate work across our APIs</a>, where I see them as common, resusable patterns that we should be getting organized–the OpenAPI 3.0 components object is the beginning of us getting this house in order. The components object is how API architects and designers can ensure that API developers are being consistent in their work, and not just reusing common elements, but reusing well thought out, fully baked elements that adhere to standards and common definitions used throughout the industry.</p>

<p>The OpenAPI 3.0 components object is where we are going to start injecting API literacy training into the development process. It is where we will teach developers about headers, and common ways of securing our APIs. It is where we will start reusing common dictinaries like Schema.org so we STOP re-inventing the wheel when it comes to defining our schema definitions, fields, and other mundane aspects of crafting an API. The components object isn’t just where we are reusing components within a single OpenAPI, it is where we will start reusing across all the OpenAPIs we are crafting, and learning, sharing, collaborating, and reusing across OpenAPIs that are made publicly available.</p>

<p>The OpenAPI 3.0 components object is where we are going to start delivering the hypermedia literacy that was required to get the adopttion that hypermedia advocates envision, but were stonewalled because people just didn’t get it. I’m pretty excited about this aspect of OpenAPI 3.0, and I got myself so fired up about it last night I started building some of my API dictionary tooling I’ve had in my head for a while, but didn’t have just the right vehicle in mind for delivering at scale. I haven’t had much time for playing with OpenAPI 3.0, or the tooling that has emerged, but I got the bug now. I’m going to prioritize some work in this area, if nothing else for generating some relevant stories here on the blog, and keeping me in tune with folks are doing. Oh, that reminds me, have you seen what my friend Mike Ralphson (<a href="https://twitter.com/PermittedSoc">@PermittedSoc</a>) is up to? <a href="https://github.com/Mermade/">He is leading the charge when it comes to OpenAPI 3.0 tooling</a> « I recommend keeping an eye on what he is up to on Github.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/document-library-files/2017/IT-AR-17-006.pdf">The Office Of Inspector General for US Postal Service published an audit report on the federal agencies API strategy</a>, which has opened their eyes to the potential of API management, and the direct value it can bring to their customers, and their business. The USPS has some extremely high value APIs that are baked into ecommerce solutions around the country, and have even launched an API management solution recently, but until now have not been actively analyzing and using API usage to guide them in any of their business planning decisions.</p>

<p>According to the report, “The Postal Service captures customer API usage data and distributes it to stakeholders outside of the Web Tools team via spreadsheets every month. However, management is not using that data to plan for future API needs. This occurred because management did not agree on which group was responsible for reviewing and making decisions about captured usage data.” I’m sure this is common in other agencies, as APIs are often evolved within IT groups, that can have significant canyons between them and any business units. Data isn’t shared, unless a project specifically designates it to be shared, or leadership directs it, leaving real-time API management data out of reach of those business groups making decisions.</p>

<p>It is good to see another federal agency wake up to the potential of API management, and the awareness it can bring to business groups. It’s not just some technical implementation with logfiles, it is actual business intelligence that can be used to guide the agency forward, and help an agency better serve constituents (customers). The awareness introduced by doing APIs, and then properly managing APIs, analyzing usage, and building and understanding what is happening, is a journey. It’s a journey that not all federal agencies have even begun (sadly). It is important that other agencies follow USPS lead, because it is likely you are already gathering valuable data, and just passing it on to external partners like USPS has been doing, not capturing any of the value for yourself. Compounding the budget, and other business challenges you are already facing, when you could be using this data to make better informed decisions, or even more important, establishing new revenue streams from your valuable public sector resources.</p>

<p>While it may seem far fetched at the moment, but <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/05/05/taxation-on-public-data-via-the-api-management-layer/">this API management layer reflects the future of government revenue and tax base</a>. This is how companies in the private sector are generating revenue, and if commercial partners are building solutions on top of public sector data and other digital resources, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/24/setting-a-precedent-when-charging-for-high-volume-access-to-government-apis/">these government agencies should be able to generate new revenue streams from these partnerships</a>. This is how government works with physical public resources, there should be no difference when it comes to digital public resources. We just haven’t reached the realization that this is the future of how we make sure government is funded, and has the resources it needs to not just compete in the digital world, but actually innovate as many of us hope it will. It will take many years for federal agencies to get to this point. This is why they need to get started on their API journey, and begin managing their data assets in an organized way as the USPS is beginning to do.</p>

<p>API management has been around for a decade. It isn’t some new concept, and their are plenty of open source solutions available for federal agencies to put to use. All the major cloud platforms have it baked into their operations, making it a commodity, alongside compute, storage, DNS, and the other building blocks of our digital worlds. I’ll be looking for other ways to influence government leadership to light the API fire within federal agencies like the Office of the Inspector General has done at the U.S. Postal Service. It is important that agencies be developing awareness, and making business decisions from the APIs they offer, just like they are doing from their web properties. Something that will set the stage for future for how the government serves its constituents, customers, and generates the revenue it needs to keep operating, and even possibly leading in the digital evolution of the public sector.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/copper-servers.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’m just coming out of a sprint for <a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">my Human Services Data API (HSDA) work</a>. Throughout the process of gathering feedback across emails, Slack Channels, and Github Issues, and trying to decide where I should be steering this ship, I’m regularly reminded that I’m often preparing for a future that may never come. I’m working real hard to make my API design as future proof as possible, but I find that in many cases I risk leaving folks behind with some of my API design decisions. When it comes to the audience for this API, municipalities and nonprofit organizations, this concern was present with every decision I have been making.</p>

<p>As part of this latest evolution, I took hypermedia and GraphQL off the table, as both areas seem to confuse and muddy the conversation, not help. I was hoping that GraphQL might help some of the requests around query-ability of APIs, and the tendency to load up individual paths with numerous parameters, and enums. I tried to facilitate discussions around unique identifiers, moving things beyond just incremental integers, taking a cue from Twitter and other large providers, but many just deemed these conversation overkill, unnecessary, and bothersome. While I have learned a lot over the last seven years as the API Evangelist, I am regularly reminded that not everyone has been along for the ride, and I need to always bring things back to ground level, even if it means making some cringe-worthy API design choices.</p>

<p>I find as a technologist, I suffer from hopeless futurism. Even though I know better, I still tend to prefer looking at what is next, preparing as much as I can for the future, even at the expense of where we’ve been, and possibly leaving people behind. I can argue until I’m blue in the face regarding the benefits of hypermedia when it comes to supporting clients, and the benefits of GraphQL when it comes to giving API consumers a stronger voice when it comes to querying and getting access to EXACTLY the data they need, but without the proper groundwork, and education, my audience is rarely going to care. APIs are a journey, and I feel like APIs have to take their course, and folks have to be along for the ride. There is just no hurrying this process, no matter how much knowledge about the future I may possess, or how passionate and aggressive I am about why a particular API design decision will matter down the road.</p>

<p>I am working very hard to tame my tech bro futurism fetish, and better understand what the humans here on the ground in the present will need. I’m also working a lot harder to try and figure out how I can incorporate API lessons into my API design and definition work. How can I teach folks about headers, with specific design decisions I’ve made? How can I teach folks about how the client will break with a certain API design approach? As a technologist it is very hard to allow myself the space to make sub-standard API design decisions for the sake of helping an audience learn along the way. I want everything to be right, dammit! However, I’d much rather that my APIs actually get used, and the folks I’m targeting with my designs aren’t turned off by what I’ve delivered because they don’t see the value, or relevance. I’m working hard to not always be a tech boy scout, and always being prepared for a future that may not come.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I am guessing that all the folks who keep saying I’m so anti-GraphQL will not recognize how much I’m incorporating it into my work, and storytelling, and that this is a POSITIVE story about how GraphQL might have helped. It also still highlighting my argument(s) around investment in API education, and not being aggressive when you are pushing GraphQL, as I’ve learned first hand and keep trying to share in my (aggressive) GraphQL posts.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/31/your-lack-of-investment-in-api-education-will-be-the-end-of-your-api-service/">I wrote about this in a mean way during my rant week</a>, but I wanted to bring up the topic of education and training when it comes to APIs in a more constructive way this week. Amidst the regular requests I get for API architects, developers, product managers, and evangelists I am reminding many companies that they will often need to hire for these roles internally, training and grooming existing employees, as finding seasoned veterans in any of these areas will prove to be difficult. I wish I had my own API school, where I was helping train waves of qualified employees, but sadly most of the folks with existing skills are employed.</p>

<p>The challenge of investing in API training and education doesn’t stop with your immediate team, this is something that needs to occur in most cases company-wide. I’ve talk with several groups about developing internal workshops, and training, but I find most of them aren’t truly interested in the investment needed, and are often looking for some free content, or someone they can get to come and speak for free or very low pay. It shows me that many companies aren’t quite ready to make the investment it will take to ensure their staff are ready for the work that lies ahead, and don’t value making sure their workers have the skills they’ll need to be successful in the API-driven world we are finding ourselves in.</p>

<p>This isn’t something I’ve just encountered at SMB, SME, and the enterprise. Government agencies are always cashed strapped, under-resourced, and lacking in the skills needed for the next wave. This is also a problem I’m seeing across startups. I’ve had discussions with startup groups selling tools and services to the API space, who are hitting significant challenges once they start selling their solutions outside the mainstream tech ecosystem. Many folks at large companies, small businesses, and government agencies just don’t have some of the basics when it comes the web, and how modern approaches to APIs work. To become an active customer, they are going to need some investment to get their customers up to speed, something I find the investors behind startups are rarely keen on spending money on.</p>

<p>I am working on a workshop series for a health care group in October, and I’m working real hard to develop some structure to help make sure I cover the fundamentals of why APIs are important, beginning with the web and HTTP. I’m trying to show the space from not just the API provider perspective, but also from the API consumer view, because everyone should be both. I’m also working on more stories to help educate why companies, investors, institutions, and government agencies should be investing more into the area of API education. Not just understanding how to provide and consume them, but how to secure them, understand that they are driving everything mobile, and can help securely open up their operations to allow for assistant by 3rd party providers. Humans will be the number one challenge you face when it comes to doing APIs in your organization, so make sure you are investing wisely. I’d love to hear more about the challenges you are facing, or how you are finding success when it comes to educating your staff or customers about everything API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/open-referral/hsda-schema.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15p;" /></p>
<p>I’m working on v1.2 of <a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">my Human Sevices Data API (HSDA)</a>, and with this wave of work I’m making sue there is a functional API for validating all JSON that gets posted as the body in requests, as well as when it gets returned as part of API responses. To drive my validator I’m using JSON schema, which I already have defined as part of <a href="https://github.com/human-services/portal/tree/master/_data/api-commons">the OpenAPI definition for the project</a>. I want to reuse, and build on top of this work, but I found the definitions for my OpenAPI to be pretty deficient in much of the details I am needing to validate the request and response bodies of my HSDA APIs.</p>

<p>The process has showed me the importance of making sure the definitions portion of my OpenAPIs are as robust as I can. Possessing required, default, regex patterns, and other details I’m going to need to make sure my schema validator is as robust as possible. I’m entering the phase of this project where vendors, and implementors are looking for guidance on whether or not their schema are HSDS/A compliant, and they are supporting the fields necessary to get a stamp of approval. The schema validator is essential to this, but the new validation API I’ve created is only as good as the JSON schema that I’m using as part of its engine.</p>

<p>I come across a number of OpenAPIs in the wild which do not possess schema definitions, and references for each API. These API providers are only describing enough of the surface area of their API to be able to generate API documentation using Swagger UI. This is something I’ve also been guilty of in the past, where I would only define the surface area of the API, just to get what I needed for my API discovery needs. Over the last year, I’ve spent more time making sure the definitions portion of the OpenAPI is also present, but it isn’t until now that I’ve been making sure the fine details of the schema are present. I need this to be in place for validation, which will be used across monitoring, testing, and other stops along the API life cycle I will be delivering as part of this work.</p>

<p>Honestly, my JSON schema chops were not up to snuff for this work, something I’ve struggled with making the time for this summer. However, I feel like I’m finally getting there. I’m beyond the basics of JSON schema validation, and have my simple API validator API in place. I just need to make sure I’m always investing the time required to develop robust JSON schema for all my APIs, so that the validator provides rich responses with each API schema validation. I’m thinking I will be build a tool for helping identify what is lacking with the definitions in my OpenAPIs, pointing out the common things I’m lacking, and running this before I ever consider actually validating the schema that are used in the API request body, or the API response body for the projects I’m working on. Always making sure the schema, and API definitions are harmonized, and speaking the same language is essential to all of this human services API effort to work properly.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/09/11/version-1-2-of-human-services-data-api/">Version 1.2 Draft Of The Human Services Data API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">11 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/open-referral/hsda-v1-2.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15p;" /></p>
<p>I have been working on the next version of the Human Services Data API (HSDA) OpenAPI lately, taking all the comments from the Github repository, and pushing forward the specification as far as I can with the minor v1.2 release. <a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Av1.2">I have the Github issues organized by v1.2</a>, and have invested time moving forward the OpenAPI for the project, as well as my demo site for the effort.</p>

<p>With this release I am focusing on six main areas, based upon feedback from the group, and what makes sense to move forward without any non-breaking changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/45">/complete</a> - add an /everything to each core resource, allowing access to all sub resouces.</li>
  <li><a href="query">query</a> - Shifting query parameter to be array, allowing for multiple fields to be queried.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/39">content negotiation</a> - Allow for JSON, XML, and responses.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/12">sorting</a> - Adding sorting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/10">pagination</a> - Adding pagination.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/48">status codes</a> - Add more status codes.</li>
</ul>

<p>These were main concerns regarding what was missing from the last release, and were the top items that made sense to push forward this round. I’ve made some other major shifts to the project, but before I go through those, I wanted to provide some more insight into these v1.2 changes to the core HSDA specification. Helping shed some light on why I did what I did, while I am looking to make the API interface as usable as possible for HSDA implementations, vendors servicing the space, as well as developers looking to build web, mobile, voice, and other applications on top of any APIs that support the implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Complete</strong>
Getting access to the entire surface area of the core resources (organizations, locations, and services), as well as all the subresources (phones, physical address, mailing address, etc.) was the most voiced request from v1.1. I had laid out several options to access the entire surface are of HSDA resources, but folks seem focused on a single set of API paths to accomplish what they needed from a vendor and implementation perspective. It is my job to keep the API serving all types of integrations and use cases, but definitely couldn’t ignore providing a single set of paths for GET, POST, and PUT of organizations, locations, and services.</p>

<p>It was important to me to keep the core resources accessible as a flat, one dimensional, and machine readable documentation, so API consumers could quickly import into spreadsheets as CSV, or make lists of addresses, or possible lookups and updates to a single phone number. I didn’t want to abandon these use cases, or introduce breaking changes, so I introduced a /complete path for all three of the core sources (organizations, locations, and services. These paths allow for GET, POST, and PUT requests of multi-dimensional JSON objects, access the core, as well as sub-resources for any data stored within the API. These paths should accommodate the heavy system to system vendor and implementation usage that was voiced as part of the feedback process, while still preserving other individual use cases.</p>

<p><strong>Query</strong>
With v1.1 the query parameter for making API requests on organizations, locations, and services was simply a string, which you could provide a set of strings for. At the request of the community we’ve made this an array, allowing you to specify multiple fields and values as part of your query. To ensure I didn’t introduce a breaking change, I did not alter the existing query parameter, instead I added a new parameter called queries, which allows you to get more detailed with your queries. Now there is a simple search, and more robust multi-field search, giving more control to API consumers. In the future we will explore more query power, but this might reside in the search API portion of this conversation which we’ll address later.</p>

<p><strong>Content Negotiation</strong>
The Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) is a CSV format. While HSDA has focused on using JSON as part of all API requests and responses, I made sure that v1.1 stayed true to the original HSDS format, making the entire surface area accessible via simple API paths, and returning one dimensional responses that can still be returned as CSV. So with v1.2 I allowed for the negotiation of either CSV, XML, or JSON content types for all the primary HSDA paths. The /complete paths do not support CSV, as they provide access to resources, and sub-resources that cannot be returned as CSV, but the rest of the surface allows API consumers to negotiate the format they desire.</p>

<p>Keeping the surface area of the entire HSDS format accessible via simple API paths, without authentication, and providing the option of returning data in CSV, opens up the API to be used to export to Excel and Google docs in a single step. This will open up the ability to extract core resources like organizations, locations, services, as well as sub-resources such as phone and address lists into CSV format, which can then easily be used by a much wider audience than just developers, and other common API consumers.</p>

<p><strong>Sorting</strong>
There was no ability to sort any data within an HSDA responses with previous version. With version 1.2 you can now provide a sort_by parameter which determines the field to sort by, and order, which determines whether to sort by ascending (asc), or descending (desc) order. I had in there to add the ability to sort by what has been changed recently, but I have run out of time, and will make sure it gets into future releases. It was important that we at least get basic sorting features in there for this release, and can add more aspects to this dimension in the near future.</p>

<p><strong>Pagination</strong>
In previous versions of HSDA you could pass in a parameter to specify which page to return, and per_page to determine how many results to return per page. However, there was no data return telling you which page you were on, the count per page, or anything else about what is next or previous as part of each results. Several solutions to this were presented as part of the feedback process for v1.0 and v1.1, but not much feedback was given on the subject. Again, I was looking to introduce this feature without any breaking changes. With the flat, one dimensional array structure of the HSDA response structure it would be difficult to add in any envelope, or collection for returning pagination data, so I set out to find examples of how it can be done without disrupting the current response structure.</p>

<p>After looking at Github an a handful of other approaches I opted to add a customer header called x-pagination which provides a JSON object containing total_pages, first_page, last_page, previous_page, and next_page to each GET response, allowing consumers to easily navigation the pagination for large API responses. This approach does not introduce any breaking changes, while still providing all the data needed by API consumers to navigate the surface area of any HSDA implementation, across organizations, locations, and services. I do have some concerns about developers being HTTP header aware, and know how to access headers, but it is something that with a little bit of education, can open a whole new world to them–something any API developer should have in their toolbox.</p>

<p><strong>Status Codes</strong>
One area that HSDA v1.0 and 1.1 were deficient in was when it came to HTTP status code guidance. I had this slated for v1.3, but I was needing to know when I hit an error in some of the validation, documentation, and other tooling  had been working on. So I took this opportunity to add 403, and 500 HTTP status codes to all API responses. All the GET paths are publicly available, but with this edition I’ve introduced an API management service, allowing me to secure all POST, PUT, and DELETE paths, opening them up to multiple users in a secure way. I didn’t want all other users to simply get a 404, so I added 403 guidance. I will be adding more specific HTTP status code guidance, and error response schema in future versions.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Services</strong>
That was the majority of features involved with the v1.2 release. However there were other aspects of HSDA that were left out of v1.1, like meta, search, and taxonomy. Also, as part of the v1.1 feedback process there were other features thrown out that were needed as part of future releases. All of this had the potential to add unnecessary complexity to the core set of resources, making the specification bloated, making things even more complex than it already is. To help alleviate these challenges I’ve started breaking future APIs into separate projects, or services. Here are the additional seven services I’ve added:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>HSDA Search</strong> - A service dedicated to search across HSDA implementations.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDA Bulk</strong> - A service dedicated to managing bulk operations across HSDA implementations.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDA Taxonomy</strong> - A service dedicated to working with taxonomy across HSDA implementations.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDA Orchestration</strong> - A service dedicated to handling orchestration, evented infrastructure, and webhooks across HSDA implementations.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDA Meta</strong> - A service dedicated to handling meta data and logging across HSDA implementations.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDA Management</strong> - A service dedicated to introducing an API management across HSDA implementations.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDA Utility</strong> - A service dedicated to housing all utility APIs across HSDA implementations.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these services are meant to augment and complement the core set of HSDA resources, and sub-resources without adding unnecessary complexity to them. These projects are meant to act as a buffet of services that human service providers can choose from, or they can opt to just stick with the basic. I’ve reset the version for each of these projects to v1.0, and will be moving them forward at their own pace, independent of what the core HSDA specification is doing. I’ve introduced separate OpenAPI definitions for each project, and I am pushing forward independent code repositories for delivering PHP/MySQL implementations for each service area. Like the other features for HSDA v1.2 above, I wanted to take a moment and explain the logic behind each of these services.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/open-referral/hsda-organizations-swagger-ui.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15p;" /></p>
<p><strong>HSDA Search</strong>
Early on in the release of v1.1 the question of search quickly began to muddy the conversation. I saw this was going to be a challenge. I saw the communities desire to deliver features via query parameters, and knew that search was going to introduce a number of parameters beyond what was needed to just manage core resources (organizations, locations, and services). We also started getting some great feedback from vendors in the Github issues for search features that went well beyond what was needed for individual resources, and often spanned all the core resources. Search had been a separate path in the core HSDA specification, and with this version I decided to break it off the core specification and put it into it’s own project, where it can become a first class citizen.</p>

<p>The current HSDA search v1.0 specification got all query, queries, sorting, and pagination that the core HSDA resource received in the v1.2 release, but once they were added it got broken off into it’s own service. Technically this is a breaking change, but I think it is one the community will support, as it will add some valuable search features. Immediately, I added a set of collections that spanned all core resources, including organizations, locations, and services, and I took the /complete features I had just added to HSDA and introduced them to HSDA search. This makes all the search results as rich, and complete as possible, providing access to the entire surface area. I feel like ultimately this is where we will be experimenting with allowing consumers to restrict, or expand the results they are looking to get back, while keeping core resources cachable, available at known paths.</p>

<p><strong>HSDA Bulk</strong>
One of the conversations that led to the introduction of /complete paths for all core resources in v1.2 was the needs of vendors, and the heavy lifting requirements of individual implementations. There was the need to load large volumes of data into systems, as well as between disparate systems. There was talk about the load this causes of systems that drive critical websites and other infrastructure, resulting it being something done during off-peak hours. Some of this work can be done via the primary HSDA /complete service, but it was clear that a separate bulk set of API would be needed to help handle the load, and meet the unique needs of system integrators, that were different than what web, mobile, voice, and other applications developers would be building.</p>

<p>HSDA Bulk reflects the HSDA /complete paths for organizations, locations, and services, but these paths accept the posting of arrays of objects, complete with all their sub-object. Instead of directly loading these into the main database upon POSTing, they are entered individually into a jobs database, where they can be queried, and run independently on a schedule, or based upon specific events. HSDA bulk will work in conjunction with HSDA, HSDA Meta, HSDA Management, and HSDA orchestration, or it can be run independently, based upon custom criteria. The goal is to provide a way to handle the bulk needs of HSDA implementations which can be deployed, scaled, and operated independently of any core HSDA implementation, limiting the impact on core websites, mobile applications, and other applications.</p>

<p><strong>HSDA Taxonomy</strong>
The taxonomy portion of HSDA got separated as part of the v1.1 release. I quickly saw it needed more thinking regarding the handling of multiple taxonomies, as well as allowing for the accessing of services beyond core HSDA resource management, or even search. HSDA Taxonomy is now it’s own project, and can be deployed independently of any HSDA implementation, but provide another doorway for querying, browsing and getting at services based upon any supported taxonomy. The v1.0 version of HSDA Taxonomy will support AIRS and Open Eligibility, but will be designed to support any other taxonomy, and allow for customization by individual implementations, while maintaining a common API for usage across multiple HSDA implementations.</p>

<p><strong>HSDA Orchestration</strong>
Throughout HSDA v1.1 discussion I kept hearing about the need for notifying users of changes to HSDA data, and the need to push and ping external systems with information. As part of the build up to v1.2 I conducted a significant amount of research into the event and webhook implementations of leading API providers like Box, Twilio, Stripe, and others. I’ve taken this research and created a v1.0 draft for an HSDA Orchestration solution. Working to alleviate a wide variety of needs for handling events that occur across HSDA implementations, engaging with external implementations, and making HSDA a two-way street.</p>

<p>HSDA Orchestration will potentially work with HSDA Meta, HSDA Bulk, HSDA Management, and of course, HSDA core to bring implementations alive. A number of events will be defined around common HSDA task that occur like POSTing of new organizations, or locations, or updating of individual records, or possibly the submission of bulk updates that need running. Every API call within an HSDA implementation can now be tracked using HSDA Meta, and HSDA Orchestration will monitor this, and allow API consumers to subscribe to these events via webhooks, and receive a ping when event occurs, or receive a fat ping, which pushes data associated with an event to an external URL. HSDA orchestration will handle all the monitoring, tracking, notification, and syncing needed between HSDA implementations via a separate, independent service that works with the HSDA stack.</p>

<p><strong>HSDA Meta</strong>
HSDA Meta is another feature that got set aside with the v1.1 release. With v1.2 I’ve set it up as it’s own project. Now each API call made to any core HSDA path will be added to the HSDA Meta system, recording the service, path, verb, parameters, and body of each request. HSDA Meta is designed to providing a logging solution, eventually a transactional layer that can be rolled forward or backwards, and is intended as stated before to work with HSDA Bulk, HSDA Orchestration, and leveraging HSDA Management for access, and auditability of all activity.</p>

<p><strong>HSDA Management</strong>
HSDA is in need of an API management layer. Many of the paths available allow for reading, writing, and deleting of data. The original HSDA v1.0 and v1.1 only allowed for a single administrative key for accessing all POST, PUT, and DELETE API paths. With the v1.2 release I’ve begun this separate project for allowing the adding, authenticating, and managing of API users who are looking to get at HSDA data. The current implementation allows for many users, and each users to have access to one, or many of the services, and supporting API paths. It is up to each implementation to decide which users get access to which. In future releases we will add the notion of access plans, allowing for trusted groups to be established, including partners, and internal consumers. The goal with this is to identify a common interface for HSDA implementations, which behind the scenes could be any number of existing API management implementations.</p>

<p><strong>HSDA Utility</strong>
Last, I needed a place to put any utility APIs I needed to help manage HSDA implementations. Right now there are two core set of APIs. One for managing which services are available across and HSDA implementation, and another for validating HSDA schema, and eventually the APIs themselves. I will be putting any other utility API within this service area. It will become the catch-all for any API that doesn’t fit into it’s service area.</p>

<p><strong>HSDA Specification</strong>
That is it. That is the bulk of the work I’ve done for the v1.2 release of HSDA. I’m pretty happy with how things have worked out. I feel there is a lot more coherency across the specification now, and the service mindset will allow for much more constructive conversations across the projects. <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/hsda/">I have updated the HSDA specification site with all eight of the OpenAPIs, publishing a separate documentation page for each one.</a> Each page provides an HTML view for each service, as well as link to the YAML version of the OpenAPI, the demo website, as well as Github Issues for each project. Next step is to drive the feedback and comments via the Github issues, include anything that is missing, and push v1.2 out the door, and begin working on v1.3, as well as the v1.1 for the seven other projects that were added with this release.</p>

<p><strong>HSDA Implementation</strong>
I do not ever feel an OpenAPI is ready for prime time until I have a working version of it. <a href="http://developer.open.referral.adopta.agency/">I have created working versions of all eight HSDA implementations.</a> The core HSDA is the most complete and robust, with HSDA Search, HSDA Bulk, HSDA Meta, HSDA Management, HSDA Utility, HSDA Taxonomy, and HSDA Orchestration following up in that order. They are v1.0 draft implementations, and for the most part are working, but have not been hardened yet. I would feel comfortable putting HSDA, and HSDA Management, and HSDA Meta into a real world implementation in coming weeks, something I will actually be doing with two separate implementations–using real world projects to harden them.</p>

<p>I have updated the HSDA demo portal to contain all eight projects, and I have leveraged Github authentication as the HSDA Management layer, allowing anyone to signup and use their Github account to access with each API. Each API call is logged, and I can easily revoke access to any account, or push reset on the demo as needed. Now that I have a working copy, I will be publishing a development version of the portal, so that I do not break the demo in the future, and can move forward with releases a little more gracefully than I did with this one. I will be maturing all eight implementations, and offering them up as official Adopta.Agency products for deployment on AWS in the near future.</p>

<p><strong>Looking To The Future</strong>
This release of HSDA and the supporting code is all about looking towards the future. I’ve separated things out into independent services to handle what is next, and I’ve re-engineered my PHP/MySQL implementations to prepare for the future. Each of the eight solutions are 100% OpenAPI driven. The database and server side code is all OpenAPI driven. The portal, documentation, and the schema validation is all OpenAPI driven. Next, I’m setting up monitoring, and testing, that will all be OpenAPI driven.</p>

<p>I also have two other services I did not include in this story because they are meant for the future. One is HSDA Custom, which allows for the addition of any field, or collection to the core HSDA implementation, accommodating the needs of individual providers. This is only possible because of OpenAPI, and each custom field will be added as x-[field], keeping things validating. The second one I’m calling HSDA Aggregation, which will be my first attempt to sync, aggregate, and migrate data across many HSDA implementations. Now that I have the base, I’m going to setup five separate demo implementations, and begin to work on robust sets of test data, which I can use to push forward an aggregate and federated version of HSDA.</p>

<p>The OpenAPI core for my HSDA work has allowed me to do some interesting things with how the APIs are delivered, as well as many of the supporting tooling. This approach to delivering HSDA implementations can be applied to any API. I will be taking <a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/">my list of several hundred Schema.org OpenAPIs</a>, and building a catalog of API definitions that can be easily deployed on AWS. I’m not going to do this as an automated software service, but I will be hand deploying solutions for clients using this approach. Providing streamlined, well-defined, yet hand-crafted API implementations for any possible situation. This was born out of hearing from HSDA providers about how they begin storing all types of data into the organizations, locations, and service data stores–things that really should be in a separate system. Eventually I’ll be suggesting other HSDA projects that assist providers with events, messaging, and other common solutions beyond just organizations, locations, and services.</p>

<p>Anyways, that concludes this sprint. I will be doing more work throughout the week, and we have a three day hackathon this week. So I’m looking forward to moving things forward more, but for right now I’m pretty glad with what I’ve achieved.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/servers-hallway-door.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>There are a number of API service and tooling providers that I still get excited about in the space. 3Scale, Restlet, Runscope, and Tyk - to begin with my sponsors! ;-) ;-) ;-) However, there are others like Postman, APIMATIC, Materia, OAuth.io, Stoplight, Apicurio, API Platform, API Umbrella, Github, API Science, and others that keep me thinking good thoughts about the things that API service providers are doing. However, I also see a lot of services and tooling that are simply playing the startup game, and have more to do with investment, then they do about APIs.</p>

<p>It is these services and tools I see as the next generation of technical debt. When you bundle the vendors who are usually chasing trends as part of their investment and exit strategy, and really don’t care about truly helping you solve your technical, and business challenges, with your existing problems, you are just multiplying your problems. These types of customers only want you as an active customer, preferably locked into a contract, with their services and tools baked into your operations. You know what all of this leads to? Technical debt. When you buy into the vendor stories, and jump on trends, without thinking through the consequences of your actions, and the long term effects on your road map, you end up with a significant amount of technical debt down the road.</p>

<p>I have taken a number of IT and developer leadership positions in my career, where I had to come in and clean up the mess from the previous guy (always guys). Nobody was questioning the decisions being made, and allowed someone to make purchasing, and technology decisions that ended up just taking things in a bad direction. That vendor we bought into was acquired, and now that tool we depend on is part of a larger enterprise suite we really don’t need, but because we can’t unwind it from our systems, we are forced to keep paying the subscription. We went for that trendy to way of doing things, decoupling, automating, assembling a framework, offshoring, outsourcing, and whatever came along with the current technological season, and investment cycle. We didn’t invest in internal capacity, or leveraging the web and standards, and now we are locked into this proprietary way of getting things done.</p>

<p>Ok, I get it. It is hard to see what is a trend, and which vendors are full of shit. I mean, they took us out to lunch, and were real nice guys. Right? They spoke all the buzz words, and seemed to really get the problems we faced keeping things up and running. I’ve made many bad decisions when it came to leading the IT or developer charge (I used to program in ColdFusion), but most of the time these were decisions that were handed to me, not ones that I made on my own (1/3 were my bad decisions ;-). These experiences have made me very skeptical about which technology I invest in, and the world of APIs has taken this to new levels for me–I trust nobody. This is the default stance I take now. I won’t adopt something new, or change the way I do things, if there is no way to easily recover, evolve, or mitigate form the decision. While the majority of these lessons have come from unreliable APIs, I still see many folks doubling down on API services and tooling that is going to burn them down the road. I just don’t think some of us are being honest with ourselves about how all this technical debt occurs in the first place, and somehow it is all just inevitable.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/photos/Millais_Boyhood_of_Raleigh.jpg" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>If you have followed my work in the API space you know that I consider myself an API storyteller before I ever would an API evangelist, architect, or the other skills I bring to the table. Telling stories about what folks are up to in the space is the most important thing to me, and I feel it is the most common thing people stumble across, and end up associating with my brand. You hear me talk regularly about how important stories are, and how all of this API thing is only a thing, because of stories. Really, telling stories is the most important you should be doing if you are an API provider or API service provider, and something you need to be prioritizing.</p>

<p>I was talking with a friend, and client the other day about their API operations, and after they told me a great story about the impact their APIs were making I said, “you should tell that story”! Which they responded, “I wish I had time to tell that story, but I don’t. My boss doesn’t prioritize me spending time on telling stories about what we are doing.” ;-( It just broke my heart. I get really, really busy during the week with phone calls, social media, and other project related activity. However, I always will stop what I’m doing and write 3-5 blog posts for API Evangelist about what I’m doing, and what I’m seeing. I know many of the stories are mundane and probably pretty boring, but they are exercise for me, of my ideas, my words, and how I communicate with other people.</p>

<p>The way that enterprise groups and startups operate is something I’m very familiar with. I’ve been scolded by many bosses, and told not read or write on my blog. This is one of the reasons I don’t work in government anymore, or in the enterprise, as it would KILL ME to not be able to tell stories. I need storytelling to do what I do. To work through ideas. It is how I learn from others. Why would I want to do something that I can’t tell others about? Why would I not prioritize the cool things my clients are doing with my APIs? Sure, there are some classified, and sensitive situations where you definitely would not, but most of the reasons I hear for not telling stories publicly about the cool things you are doing are complete bullshit. I’m sorry, but they are. Even if you have to package it as a white paper or case study, you should be putting this down for others to learn from.</p>

<p>When you find yourself telling your creative side (or me), that you wish you had time to tell that story, you should consider that a canary in the coal mine. A sign that there is other illnesses going on. Sure, once or twice is fine, but if this becomes a sustained thing, or worse–you stop wanting to tell stories at all, then you should be looking for a new gig. You just had your mojo killed. Nobody deserves that. No employer should kills their employees storytelling mojo. Even if you are all business, telling stories is essential to making things work. Press releases are stories. Ok, they are usually a very sad, pathetic story, but they are a story. Your company blog should be active. Your personal blog should be active. Go check out your personal blog, when was the last time you wrote something you were passionate about? If it was more than a year ago, your employer has put you in a box, and is looking to keep you there.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/09/08/responding-to-a-webhook/">Responding To A Webhook</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/stripe/stripe-using-webhooks.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>There are many details of doing APIs you don’t think about until you either a) gain the experience from doing APIs, or b) learn from the API providers already in the space. When you are just getting going with your API efforts you pretty much have to rely on b), unless you have the resources to hire a team with existing API experience. Which many of my readers will not have the luxury to do, so they need as much helping learning from the pioneers who came first, wherever they can.</p>

<p>One of the API pioneers you should be learning from is the payment API provider Stripe. <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks">I’ve been studying their approach to webhooks lately</a>, and I’ve managed to extract a number of interesting nuggets I will be sharing in separate blog posts. Today’s topic is responding to a webhook, which Stripe provides the following guidance:</p>

<p><em>To acknowledge receipt of a webhook, your endpoint should return a 2xx HTTP status code. Any other information returned in the request headers or request body is ignored. All response codes outside this range, including 3xx codes, will indicate to Stripe that you did not receive the webhook. This does mean that a URL redirection or a “Not Modified” response will be treated as a failure.</em></p>

<p>To be honest, I had never thought I should be responding to the webhooks I’ve setup. I treated them like a UDP request and once they went out the door and I processed, I didn’t need to response at all. How rude! I hadn’t seen any of my existing API providers offer up guidance in this area, or more likely I never noticed it. This is one of the reasons I like going though API providers documentation when I’m not integrating with them, because I tend to have a different eye for what is going on.</p>

<p>Anyways, I’m adding webhook responses to my list of building blocks for <a href="http://webhooks.apievangelist.com/">my webhook research</a>, and will be including it in future guidance. It seems like a pretty significant thing to help API consumers deliver to complete the webhook loop, and it injects more HTTP status code awareness and literacy into the conversation, which I think is always a good thing for everyone. Thinking about how we are signaling back and forth in the API game is always an important part of the equation.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/aws/aws-marketplace.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I’m keeping an eye on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/">the AWS Marketplace</a>, as well as what Azure and Google are up to, looking for growing signs of anything API. I’d have to say that, while Azure is in close second, that AWS is growing faster when it comes to the availability of APIs in their marketplace. What I find interesting about this growth is it isn’t just about the cloud, it is about wholesale APIs, and as it grows it quickly becomes about API discovery as well.</p>

<p>The API conversation on AWS Marketplace has for a while been dominated by API service providers, and specifically the API management providers who have pioneered the space:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00QHIY9OW?qid=1504806402998&amp;sr=0-7&amp;ref_=srh_res_product_title">3Scale</a></li>

</ul>

<p>After management, we see some of the familiar faces from the API space doing API aggregation, database to API deployment, security, integration platform as a service (iPaaS), real time, logging, authentication, and monitoring with Runscope.</p>

</ul>

<p>All rounding off the API lifecycle, providing a growing number of tools that API provides can deploy into their existing AWS infrastructure to help manage API operations. This is how API providers should be operating, offering retail SaaS versions of their APIs, but also cloud deployable, wholesale versions of their offerings that run in any cloud, not just AWS.</p>

<p>The portion of this aspect of API operations that is capturing my attention is the individual API providers are moving to offer their API up via AWS marketplace, moving things beyond just API service providers selling their tools to the space. Most notably are the API rockstars from the space:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=cbdb3b66-b0ad-49f9-8e00-7cfed4f5dd6c">Stripe</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=818fd455-b47c-4a62-9e3d-1a346e0f5e0e">Twilio</a></li>

</ul>

<p>After these well known API providers there are a handful of other companies offering up wholesale editions of their APIs, so that potential customers can bake into their existing infrastructure, alongside their own APIs, or possibly other 3rd party APIs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=75a7e002-c13e-48fb-94b3-a05331a41ade">Pitney Bowes</a></li>

</ul>

<p>These APIs are offering a variety of services but real quick I noticed location, machine learning, video editing, PDFs, health care, payments, sms, and other API driven solutions. It is a pretty impressive start to what I see as the future of API discovery and deployment, as well as any other stop along the lifecycle with all the API service providers offering their warez in the marketplace.</p>

<p>I’m going to setup a monitoring script to alert me of any new API focused additions to the AWS marketplace, using of course, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/marketplace/">AWS Marketplace API</a>. I’ve seen enough growth here to warrant the extra work, and added monitoring channel. I’m feeling like this will grow beyond my earlier thoughts about wholesale API deployment, and potentially pushing forward the API discovery conversation, and changing how we will be finding the APIs we use across our infrastructure. I will also keep an eye on Azure and Google in this area, as well as startup players like <a href="http://algorithmia.com">Algorithmia</a> who are specializing in areas like machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/openapi/openapi-dynamic.png" align="right" width="35%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I was brainstorming with Shelby Switzer (<a href="https://twitter.com/switzerly">@switzerly</a>) yesterday around potential projects for upcoming events we are attending, looking for interesting ideas we can push forward, and one of the ideas we settled in on, was automatically generating OpenAPIs from any open data set. We aren’t just looking for some code to do this, we are looking for a forkable, reusable way of doing this that anyone could potentially put to work making open data more accessible. It’s an interesting idea that I think could have legs, and compliment some of the existing projects I’m tackling, and would help folks make their open data more usable.</p>

<p>To develop a proof of concept I took one of my existing projects for <a href="http://api.integration.tool.apievangelist.com/">publishing an API integration page within the developer portal of API providers</a>, and replaced the hand crafted OpenAPI with a dynamic one. <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/api-integration/blob/master/_data/integrations.yaml">The project is driven from a single YAML data file</a>, which I manage and publish using Google Sheets, and already had a static API and OpenAPI documentation, making it a perfect proof of concept. As I said, the OpenAPI is currently static YAML, so I got to work making it dynamically driven from the YAML data store. The integrations.yaml data store has eight fields, which I hd published as four separate API paths, depending on which category each entry is in. I was able to assemble the OpenAPI using a handful of variables already in the config.yaml for the project, but the rest I was able to generate by mounting the integrations.yaml, dynamically identifying the fields and the field types, and then generating the API paths, and schema definitions needed in the OpenAPI.</p>

<p>It’s totally hacky at the moment, and just a proof of concept, but it works. I’m using <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/api-integration/blob/master/apis/openapi.yaml">the dynamically generated OpenAPI</a> to drive <a href="http://api.integration.tool.apievangelist.com/documentation/">the Swagger UI documentation</a> on the project. I’m not sure why I hadn’t thought of this before, but this is why I spend time hanging with smart folks like Shelby, who ask good questions, and are curious about pushing forward concepts like this. Liquid, the language used by Jekyll to deliver HTML in Github driven project like this is very limiting, providing some serious constraints when it comes to delivering tools like this. As I get stronger in my knowledge of it, and push the boundaries of what it can do, I’m able to do some pretty interesting things on top of YAML and JSON data stored on Github, within Jekyll sites like this. It can be pretty hacky, and would make many programmers cringe, but I like it.</p>

<p>While the idea needs a lot more work, it provides an interesting seed for how OpenAPI can be generated from a single (or multiple) open data file in CSV, JSON, or YAML–which Jekyll speaks natively. The possibilities to commit open data files into a Github repo and have OpenAPI, schema, documentation, and even UI elements automatically generated is pretty huge. This approach to making open data accessible holds a significant amount of potential when it comes to making the open data more discoverable, accessible, forkable, and reusable–which all open data should be by default. I will keep pushing the idea forward, and see where Shelby takes it, and report back here when I have anything more to share.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/human-services/human-services-docs-screenshot.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I am currently crafting a set of services as part of <a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">my Human Sevices Data API (API) work</a>. The core set of services for organizations, locations, and services are grouped together as a single service, as this is what I was handed, but all the additional APIs I introduce will be bundled as separate set of individual services. Over the last couple of weeks I’ve introduced seven new services, with a handful more coming in the near future. I’m enjoying this way of focusing on services, over the legacy way that is very resource focused, as I feel like it lets me step back and look at the big picture.</p>

<p>When I was defining the core API for this work I was very centered on the resources I was making available (organization, locations, and services), but once I took on a service mindset I began to see a number of things I was missing. With each service I find myself thinking about the full life cycle, not just the APIs that deliver the service. I’m thinking about the easy ones like design, deployment, and management, but I’m also thinking about monitoring, testing, and security. Then I’m delivering documentation, support, communications, and thinking about my monetization strategy, and access plans. I’m not just doing this once, I am thinking about it in the context of each individual service, as well as across all of them, taking care of the business of the services I’m delivering, not just the technical.</p>

<p>While some folks I talk to look at some of this as repeat work across my projects, I just see them as common patterns, that I should be reusing, refining, and delivering in consistent ways. I’m thinking about delivering the technology in a consistent way, and the operational, but I’m beginning to think about education, training, and how I can help folks on the provider and consumer side of things learn how things are working. I’m not just doing the technical heavy lifting to deliver APIs and then walking away, I’m bundling each search with what is needed to be valuable and successful as an actual service, that is API driven from start to finish. The service is accessible via an API, but it is also delivered, managed, and supported using APIs–everything has an API.</p>

<p>The Human Services Data APIs (HSDA) I am delivering aren’t just a single API, or set of service. They are an open source set of services that I’m putting out there for others to adopt and deliver as part of their own operations. I don’t want these to just be plug and play APIs, and want them to be plug and play services that deliver the information people need to find vital services in their community. Thinking of my APIs as services, and breaking them up into independent microservices helps me address the technical, business, and politics of delivering the technical components cities and organizations are needing. I’ve been pushing the business and politics of APIs since I’ve started, and trying to doing things in as small pieces as I can since the beginning, but the microservices conversations I’ve been tuning into have helped me think beyond the tech, the size, and actually consider how I’m doing this to deliver services to humans–it just an interesting twist that my primary project is all about delivering human service microservices. ;-)</p>

<p>I’m gearing up for a conversation about the next edition of the FOIA API, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/09/07/an-openapi-contract-for-the-freedom-of-information/">in preparation I’ve created an OpenAPI definition to help guide the conversation</a>, which I drafted based upon <a href="https://github.com/18F/beta.foia.gov/blob/master/agency-api-spec.md">the specifications published to Github</a> by the FOIA API team at 18F. This was after spending some time reading through <a href="https://github.com/18F/foia-recommendations/blob/master/recommendations.md">the FOIA recommendations for the project</a>, which is also published to Github. Having the project information available on Github, makes it easy for analysts like me to quickly get up to speed on what is going on, and provide valuable feedback to the team.</p>

<p>In my opinion, EVERY government API should start with a Github repo flushing out the needs and requirements for the project, exactly like 18F is doing as part of their FOIA work. All the details of the project are there for not just the project team, but for external participants like myself. When it comes to engaging with folks like me, the API project team doesn’t have to do anything, except send me a link to the Github repository, and maybe point out some specifics, but if the README is complete, only <a href="https://github.com/18F/foia-recommendations/">the repo link is necessary</a>. <a href="https://github.com/18F/foia-recommendations/issues">This opens up conversation around the project using Github Issues</a>, which leaves a history of the discussions that are occurring throughout the project’s life cycle. Any newcomers can invest the time into digesting the documentation, discussion, and then begin to constructively add value to what is already happening.</p>

<p>I know this type of transparent, observable project performance is hard for many folks in government. Hell, it is hard for 18F, and people like myself who do it regularly, by default. It takes a certain fortitude to do things out in the open like this, but this is precisely why you should be doing it. The process injects sunlight into ALL government projects by default. You know your work will be scrutinized from day one, all the way to delivery, so you tend to have your act together. It forces you to open up to other folks ideas and feedback, which isn’t always pleasant, but when done right, can make or break an API project. I mean, your API is going to be public, why not kick it off in the same way? Doing public APIs are all about learning, growing, and establishing a sort of R&amp;D lab around a specific set of resources and services. If this is baked into the DNA of your API project, the chances the API itself will find success is much greater.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time interfacing with government agencies around APIs. I spend more unpaid time on the phone with folks, and with the right groups I am more than happy to do this. However, I regularly encounter groups who are looking to do APIs, don’t have any existing public APIs, and no Github presence. These are the individuals I encounter who have the worst skills at working well with others, coherently sharing documentation, and many of these projects never get off the ground due to politics. Doing public APIs helps us learn how to be more transparent, observable, and accountable for the projects we are delivering. It isn’t always easy work. It is something that is a journey, and we get better at over time. More government agencies should be working with, and learning from 18F when it comes to delivering projects using Github. Your agency will be better off for it, and the public will benefit from a more observable, and accountable government.</p>

<p>Today’s stories are all based around my preparation for providing some feedback on the next edition of the FOIA.gov API. I have a call with the project team, and want to provide ongoing feedback, so I am loading the project up in my brain, and doing some writing on the topic. The first thing that I do when getting to know any API project, now matter where it is at in it’s lifecycle, is craft an <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI</a>, which will act as a central contract for discussions. Plus, there is no better way, short of integration, to get to know an API than crafting a complete (enough) OpenAPI definition.</p>

<p>After looking through <a href="https://github.com/18F/foia-recommendations/blob/master/recommendations.md">the FOIA recommendations for the project</a>, I took the draft FOIA API specification and crafted this OpenAPI definition:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/ca85e904c05e1ec28c6d277f62be2f80.js"></script>

<p>The specification is just for a single path, that allows you to POST a FOIA request. I made sure I thought through the supporting schema that gets posted, flushing out using the definitions (JSON schema) portion of the OpenAPI. This helps me see all the moving parts, and connect the dots between the API request and response, complete with definition for three HTTP status codes (200,404,500)–just the basics. Now I can see the technical details of a FOIA request in my head, preparing me for my discussion with the project owners.</p>

<p>After loading the technical details in my head, I always like to step back and think about the business, political, and ultimately human aspects of this. This is a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) API, being used by U.S. citizens to request that information within the federal government be freed. That is pretty significant, and represents why I do API Evangelist. I enjoy helping ensure APIs like this exist, are usable, and become a reality. It is interesting to think of the importance of this OpenAPI contract, and the potential it will have to make information in government more accessible. Providing a potential blueprint that can be used by all federal agencies, establishing a common interface for how the public can engage with government when it comes to holding it more accountable.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-heart-monitor.png" align="right" width="35%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I am at that all too familiar place with a project where I am having to decide whether I want to build what I need, or depend on an API service provider. As an engineer it is always easy to think you can just build what you need, but the more experience you have, you begin to realize this isn’t always the smartest move. I’m at that point with API monitoring. I have a growing number of endpoints that I need to make sure are alive and active, but I also see an endless road map of detailed requests when it comes to granularity of what “alive and active” actually means.</p>

<p>At first I was just going to use my default cron job service to hit the base url and API paths defined in my OpenAPI for each project, checking for the expected HTTP status code. Then I thought I better start checking for a valid schema. Then I thought I better start checking for valid data. My API project is an open source solution, and I thought about each of my clients and implementations as me for testing and monitoring for their needs. Then I thought, no way!! I’m just going to use <a href="http://apis.how/8nlsropidv">Runscope</a>, and build in documentation and processes that each of my clients and implementations can also use Runscope to dial in monitoring and testing of their API on their own terms.</p>

<p>Since all of my API projects is OpenAPI driven, and Runscope is an OpenAPI driven API service provider (as ALL should be), I can use this as the seed for setting up testing and monitoring. Not all of my API implementations will be using 100% of the microservices I’m defining, or 100% of the API paths available fo each of the microservices I’m defining. Each microservice has it’s core set of paths that deliver the service, but then I’m also bundling in database, server, DNS, logging and other microservice operational level APIs that not all my implementations will care about monitoring (sadly). So it is important for my clients and implementations to be easily select with APIs they care about monitoring, which OpenAPI will help do the heavy lifting. When it comes to exactly what API monitoring and testing means to them, I’ll rely on Runscope to do the heavy lifting.</p>

<p>If Runscope didn’t have the ability to import an OpenAPI to plant the seeds for API testing and monitoring I might have opted to just build out a basic solution myself. The manual process of setting up my API monitoring and testing for each client would quickly become more work than just building a solution–even if it was nowhere near as good as Runscope. However, we are increasingly living in an OpenAPI driven API lifecycle where service providers of all shapes and sizes allow for the importing and exporting of common API definition formats like OpenAPI. Helping API providers and architects like myself stick to what we do best, and not reinvent the wheel for each stop along the API lifecycle.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> <a href="http://apis.how/8nlsropidv">Runscope</a> is an API Evangelist partner.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/github/github-oauth-application.png" align="right" width="20%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I was creating a very light-weight API management solution for one of my projects the other day, and I wanted to give my API consumers a quick and dirty way to begin making calls against the API. Most of the API paths are publicly available, but there were a handful of POST, PUT, and DELETE paths I didn’t want to just have open to the public. I didn’t feel like this situation warranted a full blown API management solution like <a href="http://apis.how/zflfesymzk">Tyk</a> or <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">3Scale</a>, but if I could just let people authenticate with their existing Github account, it would suffice.</p>

<p>This project has it’s own Github organization, with each of the APIs living as open source API repositories, so I just leveraged Github, and the ability to create Github OAuth applications to do what I needed. You can find OAuth applications under your Github organizational settings, and when you are creating it, all you really need is to give the application a name, description, and a home page and callback URL, then you are given a client id and secret you can use to authenticate individual users with their Github accounts. I didn’t even have to do the complete OAuth dance to get access to resources, or refresh tokens (may will soon), I was just able to implement a single page PHP script to accomplish what I needed for this version:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/25e58174ed8b51a30274a3b371b4ca02.js"></script>

<p>I am wiring this script up to a Github login icon on my developer portal, and each API consumer will be routed to Github to authenticate, and then the page will handle the callback where I capture the valid Github OAuth token, and the login, name, email, and other basic Github information about the user. Right now the API is open to anyone who authenticates, but eventually I will be evaluating the maturity of the Github account, and limiting access based upon a variety of criteria (number of repos, account creation date, etc.). For now, I’m just looking for a quick and dirty way to allow my API consumers to get access to resources without creating yet another account. Normally I would be using OAuth.io for this, but I’m trying to minimize dependencies on 3rd party services for this project, and Github OAuth applications plus this script worked well.</p>

<p>Once a user is authenticated they can use their Github user name as the appid, and the valid Github OAuth token as the appkey, which are both passed through as headers, leveraging encryption in transport. I’m not overly worried about security of my APIs, this is more about a first line of defense and identifying consumers, however I will be validating the token with particular API calls. I’m also considering publishing API consumption data to Github repository created within each users accounts as part of API activity, publishing it as YAML, with a simple dashboard for view (authenticated with Github of course). I’ve had this model in my head for some time, and have written about it before, but I’m just now getting around to having a project to implement it in. I’m calling it my poor man’s API management, and something that can be done on a budget (FREE), but if my needs grow any further I will be using a more professional grade solution like <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">3Scale</a> or <a href="http://apis.how/zflfesymzk">Tyk</a>.</p>

<p>I consume a huge amount of blog and Twitter feeds each week. I evaluate the stories published by major tech blogs, cloud providers, and individual API providers. In my work there is a significant amount of duplicity in stories, mostly because of press release regurgitation, but one area I watch closely is the volume of stories coming out of major cloud computing providers around specific topics that are relevant to APIs. One of these topics I’m watching closely is the new area of serverless, and what type of stories each providers are putting out there.</p>

<p>Amazon has long held the front runner position because AWS Lambda was the first major cloud provider to do serverless, coining the term, and dominating the conversation with their brand of API evangelism. However, in the last couple months I have to say that Microsoft is matching AWS when it comes to the storytelling coming out of Azure in the area of serverless and function as a service (FaaS). Amazon definitely has an organic lead in the conversation, but when it comes to the shear volume, and regular drumbeat of serverless stories Microsoft is keeping pace. After watching several months of sustained storytelling, it looks like they could even pass up Amazon in the near future.</p>

<p>When you are down in the weeds you tend to not see how narratives spread across the space, and the power of this type of storytelling, but from my vantage point, it is how all the stories we tell at the ground level get seeded, and become reality. It isn’t something you can do overnight, and very few organizations have the resources, and staying power to make this type of storytelling a sustainable thing. I know that many startups and enterprise groups simply see this as content creation and syndication, but that is the quickest way to make your operations unsustainable. Nobody enjoys operating a content farm, and if nobody cares about the content when it is being made, then nobody will care about the content when it is syndicated and consumed–this is why I tell stories, and you should to.</p>

<p>Stories are how all of this works. It is stories that developers tell within their circles that influence what tools they will adopt. It is stories at the VC level that determine which industries, trends, and startups they’ll invest in. <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">Think about the now infamous Jeff Bezos mandate</a>, which has been elevated to mythical status, and contributed to much of the cloud adoption we have seen to date. It is this kind of storytelling that will determine each winner of the current and future battles between cloud giants. Whether it is serverless, devops, microservices, machine learning, artificial intelligence, internet of things, and any other scifi, API-driven topic we can come up with in the coming years. I have to admit, it is interesting to see Microsoft do so well in the area of storytelling after many years of sucking at it.</p>

<p>I have been working on the next version of <a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">my human services work</a>, which provides a way for cities to make information about organizations, locations, and services available on the web. Part of the feedback from the community around what was missing from the last version, was the number of API calls you needed to make to get a complete representation of a resource, and its sub-resources, as each API response was one dimensional. An example would be that you could get a list of locations, but to get at the list of services you had to make a separate API call. This wasn’t a lapse in API design, it was a result of the schema being born out of a CSV format, and me working to stay true to the original design, and usage of the schema.</p>

<p>In the latest version, I did release a handful of paths that provide a complete representation of each resource and it’s sub-resources. However, I have maintained the original one dimension representation of each resource and sub-resources, allowing me to offer an XML, JSON, as well as CSV representation for each API call. This allows API consumers to pull CSV lists of organizations, locations, services, and their sub-resources like address and phone lists. While not something that would be useful in all API implementations, I feel like the audience for municipal level human services data will benefit significantly being able to go from API to spreadsheet in a single step. All the GET paths for organizations, locations, and services are publicly available by default, not requiring authentication, making CSV data available via a single URL–something anyone can make happen.</p>

<p>While weighing API design decisions as part of my Human Services Data API (HSDA) work I am having to consider not just the technical of how I should be doing this. I am also deeply considering how the API will be put to use, and who will be doing that. While I am thinking about the heavy system to system integration needs of human service providers, as well as the web, mobile, and other applications. I am also thinking about the individual user who might just need a list of the names of organizations, or the addresses of services in a simple CSV format, so that they can work with the data in their most familiar format–the spreadsheet. I am just focusing on the API side of things at the moment, but once I’m done with the latest version I am going to think about some simple linking, and embeddable tooling that allows users to put CSV data from the API to work in a single click using Google Sheets, and Microsoft Excel.</p>

<p>I was reading a story on GraphQL this weekend which I won’t be linking to or citing because that is what they want, and they do not deserve the attention, that was just (yet) another hating on REST post. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/06/12/revisiting-graphql-as-part-of-my-api-toolbox/">As I’ve mentioned before, the GraphQL’s primary strength seems to be they have endless waves of bros who love to write blog posts hating on REST, and web APIs</a>. This particular post shows it’s absurdity by stating that HTTP is just a bad idea, wait…uh what? Yeah, you know that thing we use for the entire web, apparently it’s just not a good idea when it comes to exchanging data. Ok, buddy.</p>

<p>When it comes to GraphQL, I’m still watching, learning, and will continue evaluating it as a tool in my API toolbox, but when it comes to the argument of GraphQL vs. Web APIs I will just be waiting out the current assault as I did with all the other haters. The link data haters ran out of steam. The hypermedia haters ran out of steam. The GraphQL haters will also run out steam. All of these technologies are viable tools in our API toolbox, but NONE of them are THE solution. These assaults on “what came before” is just a very tired tactic in the toolbox of startups–you hire young men, give them some cash (which doesn’t last for long), get them all wound up, and let them loose talking trash on the space, selling your warez.</p>

<p>GraphQL has many uses. It is not a replacement for web APIs. It is just one tool in our toolbox. If you are following the advice of any of these web API haters you will wake up in a couple of years with a significant amount of technical debt, and probably also be very busy chasing the next wave of technology be pushed by vendors. My advice is that all API providers learn about the web, gain several years of experience developing web APIs, learn about linked data, hypermedia, GraphQL, and even gRPC if you have some high performance, high volume needs. Don’t spend much time listening to the haters, as they really don’t deserve your attention. Eventually they will go away, find another job, and technological kool-aid to drink.</p>

<p>In my opinion, there is (almost) always a grain of usefulness with each wave of technology that comes along. The trick is cutting through the bullshit, tuning out the haters, and understanding what is real and what is not real when it comes to the vendor noise. You should not be adopting every trend that comes along, but you should be tuning into the conversation and learning. After you do this long enough you will begin to see the patterns and tricks used by folks trying to push their warez. Hating on whatever came before is just one of these tricks. This is why startups hire young, energetic, an usually male voices to lead this charge, as they have no sense of history, and truly believe what they are pushing. Your job as a technologist is to develop the experience necessary to know what is real, and what is not, and keep a cool head as the volume gets turned up on each technological assault.</p>
