{% include JB/setup %}<p>One of the reasons I believe APIs are growing so popular is they are getting easier, and easier to use.The main reason they are getting easier to use is due to the adoption of RESTful approaches when delivering APIs.Many APIs that use REST can be easily hacked by just changing values in the URL query string, instantly making APIs accessible by a wider audience Once users get past the confusing acronyms and jargon us programmers use, and realize whats going on, they can start accessing the data and functionality thats behind the curtain.RESTful APIs open up data and functionality to anyone, and we are starting to see a new breed of hackers from many disciplines including journalism, social media marketing, and government, to name a few.As technology becomes increasingly important in our every day lives, people cant wait for IT or programmers to deliver, savvy users start hacking on their own.</p>
