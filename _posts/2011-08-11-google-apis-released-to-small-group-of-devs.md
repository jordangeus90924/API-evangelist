<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/google/Google-Plus-Platform-Blog-1.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Google just put up a new [Google Platform blog][1] today, to support the growing demand around their new social platform.

Developers have been waiting for the release of the Google API, so they can get to work building Google applications. While Google did put up a[Google developers signup form][2], there has been no other word about access to the Google APIs.

Apparently, todays launch of games on Google represents the first wave of developers using the Google APIs. Google chose to release the Google API to a small number of gaming partners so they could experiment, gather feedback and work the kinks out of the Google APIs before releasing it into the wild.

It shows they are starting to allow developers into the Google APIs, but I am sure they are prioritizing their partners, and unless your a Zynga or a Popcap, I doubt you'll get early access.

It seems wise of Google to open up access to game developers first, after the major success of the Facebook API platform was around gaming.
