Nike is working on a new API as part of their [Nike Better World initative][2]. The [API provides access to a materials sustainability index][3], which evaluates the environmental impact of materials used by manufacturers.

The scoring system evaluates the environmental impacts of materials used in products using a combination of materials-specific data, covering areas such as Chemistry, Energy and Greenhouse Gas Intensity, Water and Land Use Intensity, and Waste.

The [Nike Materials Sustainability Index API][4] is only in alpha stage right now, and is undergoing for a peer review process with Duke University. You can follow their [Nike Makerâ€™s Blog][5] to get more information on the initiative and get notified when the API will be available to the public.
