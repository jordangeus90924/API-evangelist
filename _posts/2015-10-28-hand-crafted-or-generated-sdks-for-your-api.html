<p>One of the discussions we are having <a href="http://apiware.io/">behind the scenes at APIWare.io</a>, is whether we should be hand-crafting, or auto-generating SDKs for the clients we are working with on the design, deployment, and management of their APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer is easy--we do both!&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many situations where I would push for the <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">API SDKs</a> to be hand-crafted, and designed for a specific API, as well as specific language or platform. However, with the increase in the number of APIs, and simplicity of some of the APIs I work with, crafting an API definition, and <a href="https://apimatic.io/">auto-generating your SDKs using a service like APIMATIC</a>, makes sense.</p>
<p>I've cracked open the APIMATIC SDKs, and only being fluent in JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, and C#, I can only speak to these realms of operation, but I'm happy with what the APIMATIC team is producing. For me, this isn't a black and white game, it isn't hand-crafted vs. autogenerated--it is how you employ both approaches across your API operations.</p>
<p><a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC provides high quality SDKs in 10 languages</a>, some languages I do not speak. The APIWare.io team has a wealth of programming talent on the team, and while we could hand code libraries across these areas, for all of our clients, for many of the more straightforward APIs, it just makes sense to generate. We are already an API-definition first shop, where we craft Swagger, API Blueprint, RAML, or other required API definition format, so using this to generate SDKs makes sense in many situations.</p>
<p>Are you trying to figure out the best path forward for providing high quality SDKs for your API?Llet me know how my APIWare team can help. They are willing to help you figure out the best route for providing the SDKs you need, but also help maintain them as part of the versioning, and overall roadmap for your API operatins. Even if you just need someone to talk through the pros and cons, I am here to help--let me know.</p><p><strong>Updated November 27, 2015:</strong> Links were updated as part of switch from Swagger to OADF (<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>READ MORE</strong></a>)
