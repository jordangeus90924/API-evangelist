        <span class="post-date">25 May 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/iPhone-Desktop.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of the best ways to explain what APIs are to someone sitting next to me on the plane is to find something the user does every day, that is driven by an API, and explain how an API drives the functionality they take for granted.</p>
<p>I tend to look for industry specific examples if they are an accountant or stock broker, but the most common example I use, is Facebook.  Facebook is technology everyone I meet has exposure with.</p>
<p>My story always starts with Facebook.com, and how the social networking website was built for people.  People go to www.facebook.com and they see HTML web pages, that allow them to interact with the community.</p>
<p>Next I move to the Facebook application on their mobile phone.  While the application is built for people to use, the application needs a way to talk with Facebook--in comes APIs.  APIs are a way for other programs to interact with Facebook, providing a interface for developers to build applications that use Facebook.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/iPhone-Facebook-Login.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>When you first login to Facebook on your mobile phone, the applications makes a request to the Facebook Authentication API, and gives your mobile application rights to interact with your Facebook account on your behalf.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/iPHone-Facebook-Auth.png" alt="" width="325" align="left" /></p>
<p>After your logged into the Facebook application on your mobile app, every action you take will make an API call.  When you click on your news feed, update your status, look at photos or check-in to a place, they each represent a different call to the <a title="Facebook Open Graph API" href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/">Facebook Open Graph API</a>.   The Open Graph API exposes almost every aspect of Facebook as a programmatic interface that applications can use, hence the name Application Programming Interface (API).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most online technologies that you use everyday have APIs.  Amazon, EBay, Facebook, Twitter and Google all have APIs, allowing developers to build applications on top of their businesses, turning their websites into web services.</p>
<p>With the grwoth of the smart phone and tablet markets, the number of, and usage of APIs are exploding, silently driving the mobile applications like Facebook that are part of your everyday lives.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 May 2012</span>
        <p><a title="Pinterest" href="http://pinterest.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/pinterest/Pinterest_Logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Here we are going into June, and I still don&rsquo;t see a publicly available <a title="Pinterest" href="http://pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> API.  Jay Yarow wrote in Business Insider back in February, "<a title="Pinterest's API Is Coming Soon, And VCs Are Super Excited" href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-03-26/tech/31238519_1_mobile-apps-twitterrific-hootsuite">Pinterest's API Is Coming Soon, And VCs Are Super Excited</a>" and Adam Duvander wrote in ProgrammableWeb, "<a title="Pinterest API: Coming Soon or Already Here" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/02/09/pinterest-api-coming-soon-or-already-here/">Pinterest API: Coming Soon or Already Here</a>?".</p>
<p>There is also a <a title="reply to a Quora thread by Yashh Nelapati" href="http://www.quora.com/Pinterest/Is-there-an-API-for-Pinterest-that-allows-users-to-display-a-set-of-pins-photos-on-your-own-website">reply to a Quora thread by Yashh Nelapati</a>, Lead Engineer at Pinterest from May 2011, saying the API is 2-3 weeks away.  It&rsquo;s now a year later and there is no official API (<a title="rogue api" href="http://tijn.bo.lt/pinterest-api">there is a Rogue API</a>).</p>
<p><a title="Business Insider" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/">Business Insider</a> says, Pinterest fears having a <strong><em>"<a title="Twitter Problem" href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-03-26/tech/31238519_1_mobile-apps-twitterrific-hootsuite">Twitter problem</a>&rdquo;</em></strong>.  Meaning that when Twitter released its API, it was still an immature company, allowing developers to build applications with features that it was missing--then Twitter matured, and it wanted to control its platform, it began adding building its own features and poaching from the Twitter API ecosystem.</p>
<p>So why not learn from Twitter and other APIs, and use the appropriate API building blocks to address this:</p>
<p><a title="Pinterest" href="http://pinterest.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/pinterest/Pinterest-Home-Page.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Branding Guidelines</strong> - Establish branding guidelines that clearly lays out what apps that use Pinterest API should look like</li>
<li><strong>UI / UX Toolkit</strong> - Provide a UI / UX toolkit like Twitter Bootstrap that sets the tone for applications built on the API</li>
<li><strong>Roadmap</strong> - Provide a real-time and transparent roadmap that developers can use to help keep their development efforts in line with Pinterest</li>
<li><strong>Developer Framework</strong> - Establish a developer framework outlining opportunities for developers to become stronger members of API community, also introducing possible investment and incubation of most success or important features</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Use</strong> - Establish a fair and equitable terms of use that protects Pinterests but acknowledges the commercial aspirations of developers</li>
<li><strong>Events / Meetups</strong> - Establish a roadshow or network of meetups that brings developers together and makes them part of the Pinterest API community</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the ways Pinterest could establish a solid business strategy for their API that would not only protect developer interests, it would establish the Pinterest API as an external research &amp; development department, with a built in incubation component.</p>
<p>Pinterest has already missed out on a year of developers innovating on their platform.  Why continue holding back innovation?  Establish a flexible API business strategy that allows for you to learn from the mistakes made by Twitter, and become the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pinterests-api-is-coming-soon-and-vcs-are-super-excited-2012-2">platform VC&rsquo;s are looking for you to become</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 May 2012</span>
        <p><a href="/serviceproviders/apigee.php"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/apigee-logo.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for solid examples of how more and more of our every day world is being driven by APIs.  Examples I can use to help explain APIs to every-day business folks.</p>
<p>I came across one example that will speak to many business executives today via an <a title="Apigee Innovator Spotlight on their client TradeKing" href="http://blog.apigee.com/detail/innovator_spotlight_tradeking/">Apigee Innovator Spotlight on their client TradeKing</a>.  When asked about the vision of their API program Dan Raju CIO of TradeKing says:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/tradeking/TradeKing-CIO.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></p>
<blockquote><em>We are one of the top-ranked online brokerages in the country, growing very rapidly. We manage people's assets, give them a set of capabilities to trade, and offer an extremely transparent pricing structure. However, we recognized that our customers&rsquo; demands for next-generation interfaces are rapidly changing, and our API helps us stay in front of that. We anticipate that in the next phase, the API will be a meaningful revenue driver for us. It is already opening us up to new markets.  We will continue to develop our own platforms on the API and incentivize and engage our development partners.  At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s all about delivering value to our customers, and the API will continue to help us drive increased value at an accelerated pace.</em></blockquote>

<p>Raju hits on all the best of the API buzzwords including transparency, rapid change, meaningful revenue, open to new markets, and delivering value to end-customers.</p>
<p>I feel TradeKings vision of their API program, speak to larger visions of the API driven economy we are now immersed in, and provide a great example we can reference when helping other companies not just understand what an API is, but the imperative for their companies to embrace APIs and actively join the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 May 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/Facebook-Developer.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Facebook provides an interface for Open Graph API developers to better understand how users are interacting with content via their applications, called&nbsp;<a title="Insights" href="http://www.facebook.com/help/search/?q=insights">Insights</a>.</p>
<p>With Insights you can monitor the number of your unique users that are seeing and accessing a Facebook authorization dialog, number of unique users publishers stories through Open graph as well as viewing and clicking on those stories.</p>
<p>While the number of users clicking, viewing on stories is very cool, I&rsquo;m interested in their stats regarding the authorization dialog.  Insights provides data on how many times people access your dialog authorization, with the number of acceptances, while also breaking down the number of views, acceptances into a corresponding conversion rate.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/facebook-insights-auth.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>If your authorization dialog prompts users for different permission sets, you&rsquo;ll also see a breakdown of the impressions, accepts and CTR for each one, showing you the rates at which people accept and reject different permission sets--helping you to identify the most optimal permission set for your authorization dialog, which will directly help increase user installs for your app.</p>
<p>This kind of insights for developers is critical, helping them understand the level of engagement with users and build a more effective Auth Dialog flow, which could make or break an applications Facebook Open Graph integration and adoption.</p>
<p>Providing developers with analytics to evaluate their users API usage is so valuable, I wonder if I can find any other examples of this granular type of OAuth reporting with other APIs or from API service providers like Apigee?</p>

<p>Adam Duvander (<a href="/admin/blog/Adam Duvander">@adamd</a>)&nbsp;<a title="reported at ProgrammableWeb today that they rolled over 6,000 public APIs in the directory" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/05/22/6000-apis-its-business-its-social-and-its-happening-quickly/">reported at ProgrammableWeb today that they rolled over 6,000 public APIs in the directory</a>.  The pace at which companies are launching public APIs is accelerating, with the last 1,000 added in just 3 months.</p>
<p>Any of us in the space knows that this is just the <a title="tip of the iceberg" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/11/03/private-api/">tip of the iceberg</a>, and Adam acknowledges that internal API usage is a major factor in API growth.  While public APIs get all the major press, there are many private API initiatives that won&rsquo;t see the light of day.</p>
<p>So my question is, how are we going to track on the growth of private APIs along with public APIs?  Since mobile app development is such an important piece, can we count mobile apps produced by a company?  Can we count on API service providers to start reporting on this data?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the answer.  It is something I think we need to figure out, not just so ProgrammableWeb can have its finger on the pulse, but there is an ever increasing amount of business and personal resources flowing through these API pipes, we need to have an understanding of where these API pipes are laid, which industries, etc.</p>
<p>Much like the rollout of fiber in the late 90&rsquo;s, we are going to see massive API rollouts, without much oversight and map of where these virtual pipes are.  I&rsquo;d like to hear more about how we can work together to build a map of the back-end of the new API driven economy.</p>

<p>One service that was a catalyst for the event occuring, was assistance from <a title="EventUp" href="http://eventup.com/">EventUp</a>.  EventUp is a service that assists event venue owners in finding people to rent their space, and in turn can help you find the ideal location for your hackathon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tony Adam (<a title="@tonyadam" href="https://twitter.com/#!/tonyadam">@tonyadam</a>) the owner of EventUp emailed me one day after I had submitted a request via eventup.com for more information on venues for my Hackathon in the Los Angeles area.  He offered to help make sure I found the right location.</p>
<p>After a couple days he helped me secure <a href="http://www.coloft.com/">CoLoft</a> which was the best location for the hackathon imaginable.  It was accessible, had great layout with tables, good wifi and the staff was extremely helpful.</p>
<p><a title="EventUp" href="http://eventup.com/">EventUp</a> isn&rsquo;t in all markets yet, but if you&rsquo;re planning a hackathon I recommend talking with Tony at Eventup, and seeing if they have the right location for your event.</p>

<p>I am really starting to see <a title="my early visions of the Internet" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2012/05/03/apis-help-deliver-on-early-commerce-visions-of-the-internet/">my early visions of the Internet</a>&nbsp;coming together.  In my mind I see an interconnected world of products and commerce, where every business has an API.</p>
<p>APIs finally seem to be maturing, reaching a point where they can deliver at the scale and reliability we need, to really make this happen.  Three good examples of this are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="The StructuredRetailProducts.com API" href="http://www.structuredretailproducts.com/tab/api.html">The StructuredRetailProducts.com API</a></strong> - Providing to access to over 3 million individual product listings from 1700+ companies, representing total sales of over &pound;3,382 billion and counting. Access 15+ years of product and market data across 72 different countries at the click of a button and get the latest data on sales volumes, activity levels, and market share.</li>
<li><strong><a title="The Elastic Path Digital Commerce API" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/">The Elastic Path Digital Commerce API</a></strong> - A Digital Commerce Engine&trade; for driving any e-commerce experience, on any device or platform, allowing companies to build compelling product experiences, leverage new business models, and extend their reach to emerging end points.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Stripe API" href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe API</a></strong> - A complete payment platform, that handles everything, including storing cards, subscriptions, and direct payouts to your bank account, without a merchant account or gateway.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you look through those three APIs, you see the simplicity of REST + JSON, plus the essential building blocks to support developers, and the power and scalability you need to drive commerce in the API driven economy.</p>

<p>Last week Facebook <a title="announced a new App Center" href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2012/05/09/introducing-the-app-center/">announced a new App Center</a> where developers can submit applications they've built. &nbsp;Like any API owner, Facebook is looking for high quality applications to list in its directory and has published a list of App Center Best Practices:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Websites must provide a personalized experienc</strong>e - All websites and mobile web apps need to immediately present authenticated users with a logged-in experience. Specifically, we&rsquo;re looking for personalization, such as name and profile picture, so users know that their Facebook information is being used to create an account. </li>
<li><strong>Review your app settings </strong>- App detail pages are dynamic based on the integrations you&rsquo;ve specified on the basic settings page of the Developer App. Be sure to review this and remove any old or non-functional integrations. </li>
<li><strong>Provide high-quality images -</strong> Your images should match the quality of your app. As specified in the guidelines, images shouldn&rsquo;t have buttons, excessive text, borders, dropshadows, URLs, promotions, pricing, or third-party logos. </li>
<li><strong>Input accurate names &amp; thoughtful descriptions -</strong> Don&rsquo;t add any additional keywords to the name of your app. Proofread your app description for spelling and grammar and remove unnecessary symbols, like stars, hearts and multiple exclamation points.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some food for thought. Every app center will be different and have different requirements. I think I will add App Center Best Practices as a <a title="building block" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">building block</a>, after I look at a wide selection of other API app showcases, and identify some common best practices.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 May 2012</span>
        <p><a title="PeopleBrowsr Kred API" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/peoplebrowsr/kr_pb_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Explaining to developers, what an API does, can be hard.  How you describe your API, the underlying endpoints, can make or break user adoption.  You shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to evolve, and keep trying to find the sweet spot in both the language and branding that you use in your API area.</p>
<p>I saw an example of this today, with the restructuring of <a href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/">PeopleBrowsr's APis</a>.  When I first starting playing with PeopleBrowsr's APIs, they were broken into 3 separate APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>PeopleBrowsr API</li>
<li>Kredentials API</li>
<li>Kred API</li>
</ul>
<p>On the surface its really hard to know what each of these APIs does, but after I dove in I saw lots of value within individual methods, but I really had to spend time, getting to know each method, one by one.  I saw the value, but the structure and presentation of the PeopleBrowsr API area, and the way the interfaces were assembled, didn&rsquo;t immediately speak to this value.</p>
<p>Today they&rsquo;ve restructured their three APis into a single API, dubbed the <a title="PeopleBrowsr Kred API" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/">PeopleBrowsr Kred API</a>, and grouped all the API methods into four logical groups:</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/peoplebrowsr/kred-dashboard.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Find Influencers" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/find">Find Influencers</a></strong> -  Pinpoints influential people on any subject or within communities connected by shared interests or affinities.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Deep Analytics" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/deep">Deep Analytics</a></strong> -  Author-based analytics which includes Kredentials (a single-screen summary of anyone&rsquo;s social presence), historical Kred scores, reach, and friends &amp; followers. </li>
<li><strong><a title="Action Analytics" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/action">Action Analytics</a></strong> - Aggregated social data metrics for any keyword, hashtag or @name, including mention counts, word clouds and hashtag clouds.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Global Kred Score" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/kred">Global Kred Score</a></strong> - Appends global Kred scores to @names or twitter IDs in web-based applications. </li>
</ul>
<p>This new presentation immediately helps me understand which methods I should use based upon my goals.  PeopleBrowsr took the time to understand how developers were using their API, and worked to present the API in a way that best speaks to this.</p>
<p>PeopleBrowsr also took the time to understand the value delivered via their API in each of these new areas and restructure pricing to reflect this value:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Find Influencers -  $1.00 per call</li>
<li>Deep Analytics -  .10 cents per call</li>
<li>Action Analytics  - .01 cent per call</li>
<li>Global Kred Score  - Free</li>
</ul>
<p>Only time will tell if the new structure of the <a title="PeopleBrowsr Kred API" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/">PeopleBrowsr Kred API</a> will truly speak to developers that are looking to harvest insights from social media, but I like what they did to understand the needs of their developers, and work to better deliver the API presentation, documentation and pricing to reflect this need.</p>
<p>Make sure you are tuned into what your API developers are looking for and aren&rsquo;t afraid to evolve and better serve your developer community.</p>
<p><em>Disclosure: &nbsp;I have consulted for PeopleBrowsr in the past.</em></p>

<p>API metrics are an essential, but what should we measure?  There are two metrics that seems to dominate discussions about success of the API industry:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Number of New API Registration</li>
<li>Number of Daily and Monthly API Calls</li>
</ul>
<p>Every API I&rsquo;ve consulted with, use the same two metrics, if they have any at all.  The tech blogosphere (driven by <a title="API service proviers" href="http://apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/">API service providers</a>) have created a so call <a title="billionaires club" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/25/who-belongs-to-the-api-billionaires-club/">billionaires club</a>, showcasing APIs that have over a billion API calls within a day or month.</p>
<p>Investors are even using the number of API calls as a<a title="considered a metric you can use to consider the valuation of a company by investors" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/03/kleiner-klout-30-million/">&nbsp;metric to consider the valuation of a company</a>, and seen as a good indicator of the demand for a company&rsquo;s services.</p>
<p>I agree that new registrations and number of API calls are a start, but we should be able to identify many other metrics to truly measure the activity and success of an API and the sentiment of it's API developer community.</p>

<p><a title="USDA&rsquo;s Agricultural Marketing Service" href="http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/">USDA&rsquo;s Agricultural Marketing Service</a> (AMS) has released a new, publicly available <a title="web API for its Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) system" href="http://marketnews.usda.gov/portal/lg/lmprswsreg">web API for its Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) system</a>, offering access to all historical LMR data, allowing users to pull large amounts of customized data sets via a RESTful interface with JSON embedded URLs and XML formatted output.</p>
<blockquote><em>"The Livestock Mandatory Reporting program facilitates open, transparent price discovery and provides all market participants, both large and small, with comparable levels of market information for cattle, swine, sheep, beef and lamb meat," said Craig Morris, Deputy Administrator of the AMS Livestock and Seed Program.

<p>This summer its been 2 years since I started API Evangelist.  API Evangelist started as my research project into the Business of APIs, and became a full time career.</p>
<p>While over the last two years I&rsquo;ve worked for clients like <a title="Mimeo" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> and <a title="CityGrid" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com">CityGrid</a>, my ultimate goal is to focus on studying the Business of APIs.  So whenever I get the time, I study how popular APIs operate, and how they are transforming industries.</p>
<p>This month, I&rsquo;m getting the opportunity to dive deeper into my research around different API business models, with the chance to look at the politics within specific API ecosystems.</p>
<p>While my research will always span the entire API sector, this round I&rsquo;m going to study the approach of some of the most successful APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - Deep understanding of the largest, and most important API ecosystem</li>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> - Better understanding of the largest API driven social platform</li>
<li><strong>Google</strong> - Document the 100 or so APIs offered by Google, and the platform that connects them</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> - Better picture of the leading business social network platform</li>
<li><strong>Amazon</strong> - Document the history of this API pioneer</li>
<li><strong>Twilio</strong> - Understand how Twilio continues to deliver their API, and woo developers</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to begin by&nbsp;<a title="analyzing the business and politics of Twitters API ecosystem" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/05/06/the-business-and-politics-of-twitters-api/">analyzing the business and politics of Twitters API ecosystem</a>, and as more funding comes through I&rsquo;ll focus on the other APis.  While studying each API I look at:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Historical company blog posts, tweets and press releases</li>
<li>Historical blog posts and tweets from the blogosphere and developers</li>
</ul>
<p>I organize all my research into a curation framework I&rsquo;ve developed and will be generating:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Timeline</strong> - A easy to navigate, timeline of the APIs history through curated blog posts, tweets and company announcments.</li>
<li><strong>Blog Posts</strong>&nbsp;- Single and series of blog posts documenting the business and politics of each API provider.</li>
<li><strong>Final Paper(s)</strong> - Each project will have at least one final white-paper with findings from the research.</li>
<li><strong>Raw Research</strong> - A searchable repository of curated research and notes from my work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then making this work available across both <a title="apievangelist.com" href="http://apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a> and my new blog <a title="apivoice.com" href="http://apivoice.com">apivoice.com</a>, which tends to focus on the politics of APIs including legal and other issues affecting developer ecosystems.</p>
<p>I feel pretty strongly that this new round of research will help me better understand the business and politics of APIs, produce rich research, stories and industry reports that I can make available--helping us all better understand this ever changing API economy.</p>

<p>I attended a great webinar put on by the folks at <a title="Apigee" href="/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a> last week, where they discussed <a title="APIs &amp; Copyright" href="http://www.slideshare.net/apigee/apis-copyrights">APIs &amp; Copyright</a>.  A very timely discussion with the recent API copyright decision in the EU, and from the ongoing <a title="Oracle vs. Google" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/05/07/us-precedent-for-api-copyright-hinges-on-oracle-v-google/">Oracle vs. Google case</a>.</p>
<p>As I process all discussions around API copyright, I&rsquo;m going to publish relevant pieces here at <a title="API Voice" href="http://apivoice.com/">API Voice</a>, for everyone else to process along with me.  One interesting piece of the Apigee discussion is that APIs have been copyrightable for the last 22 years--specifically referencing the <a href="http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=19892059886F2d1173_11869.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR2-1986-2006">JOHNSON CONTROLS, INC. v. PHOENIX CONTROL SYSTEMS, INC.</a> from October 3rd, 1989.  On <a href="http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?page=3&amp;xmldoc=19892059886F2d1173_11869.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR2-1986-2006&amp;SizeDisp=7">page three</a>, it states:</p>
<blockquote><em>"A computer program is made up of several different components, including the source and object code, the structure, sequence and/or organization of the program, the user interface, and the function, or purpose, of the program. Whether a particular component of a program is protected by a copyright depends on whether it qualifies as an "expression" of an idea, rather than the idea itself."</em></blockquote>
<p>Beyond Johnson Controls, Inc v. Phoenix Control Systems, it appears there is further precedent to apply copyright to APIs.  The filing also references:</p>
<blockquote><em>See Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.,<a href="http://www.leagle.com/xmlcontentlinks.aspx?gfile=471%20U.S.%20539">471 U.S. 539</a>, 547, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 2223, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985); Data East USA, Inc. v.

<p>I think the questions API owners and developers should be asking themselves is not, whether or not they might have to think about API copyright protection in the future, but that it is something they should be discussing now, when it comes to their other legal API&nbsp;building blocks like&nbsp;<a title="terms of use" href="/buildingblocks/terms_of_use__conditions.php">terms of use</a>,&nbsp;<a title="privacy" href="/buildingblocks/privacy.php">privacy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="branding" href="/buildingblocks/branding.php">branding</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 May 2012</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for API stories that capture the power of APIs, showcasing how they are transforming industries and businesses around the globe. Today, my global API monitoring platform picked up one such story in Edinburg, Scotland.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2011, the summer-based <a title="Edinburgh Festivals" href="http://www.edinburghfestivals.co.uk/">Edinburgh Festivals</a> made their event listings data publicly available for digital developers and technologists, via web APIs.  There are seven events participating in the API:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/edinburgh-festivals/edinburgh-photo1.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Edinburgh Jazz &amp; Blues Festival" href="http://www.edinburghjazzfestival.com/">Edinburgh Jazz &amp; Blues Festival</a></li>
<li><a title="Edinburgh Art Festival" href="http://www.edinburghartfestival.com/">Edinburgh Art Festival</a></li>
<li><a title="Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo" href="http://www.edintattoo.co.uk/">Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo</a></li>
<li><a title="Edinburgh Mela" href="http://www.edinburgh-mela.co.uk/">Edinburgh Mela</a></li>
<li><a title="Edinburgh International Festival" href="http://www.eif.co.uk/">Edinburgh International Festival</a></li>
<li><a title="Edinburgh International Book Festival" href="http://www.edbookfest.co.uk/">Edinburgh International Book Festival</a></li>
<li><a title="Edinburgh Festival Fringe" href="http://www.edfringe.com/">Edinburgh Festival Fringe</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite all the printed brochures and media coverage, with 44,000 performances in 3,000 separate venues, discovery, planning and finding what you want to see at the Edinburgh festivals is a near impossible task.  Event organizers needed a way to provide the most up to date event information for the media and press, while also delivering the most enhanced experience possible for festival goers.</p>
<p>So, upholding their commitment to openness and innovation, the <a href="http://festivalslab.com/">Edinburgh Festival organizers decided to release their data via API</a>.  With an API they hoped to challenge developers to build things that extended the reach of the festival, beyond what the event could do themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://festivalslab.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/edinburgh-festivals/Edinburgh-Festivals-Innovation-Lab.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
</ul>
<p>Immediately festival organizers started seeing innovation around the API, and further encouraged developers with the <a href="http://ideas.edinburghfestivals.co.uk/">Edinburgh Festivals Idea Challenge</a>, offering prizes to the top 25 of 291 ideas submitted. &nbsp;The Edinburgh Festival API has spawned many projects including:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Festipods</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; a fun and engrossing way of visualizing the Edinburgh festival events that you have attended</li>
<li><strong>Festivalclock.com</strong>&nbsp;- a beautiful visualisation of the summer festivals listings information</li>
<li><strong>FakeFringe</strong>&nbsp;- a fun game where players have to guess which Fringe show description is real and which is the fake</li>
<li><strong>Festafriend</strong>&nbsp;- a website that uses the festivals as a way for people to date and make new friends</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/acoulton">Andrew Coulton (@acoulton)</a>, of the Ediburgh International Book Festival was very excited about APIs from the beginning, realizing there was a lot that they wanted to accomplish, but didn't have the resources internally to make happen, and had hopes that the API could help deliver.  Coulton states that when you focus on providing the best quality data possible, building a developer community--that is when the most exciting things happen can happen around your API.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/edinburgh-festivals/Andrew-Coulton.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>Looking back, Coulton says they had to focus on three key areas, to make the API happen:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Business</strong> - Making the business case for deploying an API</li>
<li><strong>Technical</strong> - Overcoming technical challenges with deploying an API</li>
<li><strong>Emotional</strong> - Overcoming historically proprietary attitudes of event organizers regarding their data</li>
</ul>
<p>The Edinburgh Festival's innovation around their API is a great case-study for any business, arts, tourism or sporting event organizer, who wants to take their event to the next level.  While there are definitely some major challenges to deploying a festival API, the potential for strengthening the event's brand, showcasing performers, keeping media up-to-date and creating the best possible experience for festival goers is massive.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 May 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-analytics/google-analytics-screenshot.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>There are a lot of high value APIs emerging these days,  APIs with access to essential business data, resources and intelligence.</p>
<p>When designing your API you want to make the interface as intuitive as possible, and ensure&nbsp;as wide as access to it as you possibly can.&nbsp;To quote Jonathan Schwartz, Sun CEO regarding Java APIs:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We wanted to build the biggest tent and invite as many people as possible,&rdquo; Schwartz said. &ldquo;You have open APIs and compete on implementations."</em></blockquote>
<p>To do this, I encourage building tools and widgets that non-developers can use when working with your API.  A great example of this is at Google, with their <a title="Google Analytics Dashboard" href="http://analytics-api-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/reporting/javascript/ez-ga-dash/docs/user-documentation.html">Google Analytics Dashboard Library</a>.  Google wanted to make it <a title="easier for users to deploy a dashboard" href="http://analytics.blogspot.com/2012/05/new-google-analytics-easy-dashboard.html">easier for users to deploy a dashboard</a> that was tailored specifically for their business, so using a team of University of California Irvine students, they set out to simplify it down to 3 steps:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Register with Google APIs Console.</li>
<li>Copy and paste the JavaScript code.</li>
<li>Configure this code to query your data and choose a chart type to visualize it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, you still have to be JavaScript savvy to work with the Google Analytics Dashboard Library, understand how to edit your site, and be fluent in Google Analytics--but it&rsquo;s a step closer to providing wider access to the power of the <a title="Google Analytics API" href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics API</a>, beyond just the development community.</p>
<p>LinkedIn also has some great examples of taking concept this to the next level with their <a title="plugin builders" href="https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins/member-profile-plugin-generator">&ldquo;plugin&rdquo; builders</a> which essentially generates the widgets for users, using the API. Since Google is going to keep working with the Google Analytics Dashboard Library over the next 3 quarters, so I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll see their library evolve as well.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/linkedin/LinkedIn-Widget-Builder.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep exploring other great examples of API embeddable strategies that can potentially bring in a much wider audience, opening up your API for access beyond developers, potentially bringing in other more business oriented groups.</p>

<p>Twitter has an innovative approach to presenting the objects that make up the Twitter Platform.  They have built a&nbsp;<a title="field guide to Twitter Platform objects" href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects">field guide to Twitter Platform objects</a>, designed like an <a title="Audubon Society" href="http://www.audubon.org/">Audubon Society</a> field guide, describing the four primaty Twitter objects:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Tweets</strong> -&nbsp;Also known as a&nbsp;Status Update, Tweets are the basic atomic unit of all things Twitter. Users&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/update">create Tweets</a>. Tweets can be&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-tweets">embedded</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/update">replied to</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/favorites/create/%3Aid">favorited</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/favorites/destroy/%3Aid">unfavorited</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/retweet/%3Aid">retweeted</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/destroy/%3Aid">unretweeted</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/destroy/%3Aid">deleted</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong> -&nbsp;Users can be anyone or anything. They&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/update">tweet</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/friendships/create">follow</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/lists/create">create lists</a>, have a&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/home_timeline">home_timeline</a>, can be&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/mentions">mentioned</a>, and can be<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/users/lookup">looked up</a>&nbsp;in bulk.</li>
<li><strong>Entities</strong> -&nbsp;Entities provide metadata and additional contextual information about content posted on Twitter. Entities are never divorced from the content they describe. After May 14th, 2012&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tweet-entities">Tweet Entities</a>&nbsp;will be returned wherever&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects/tweets">Tweets</a>&nbsp;are found in the API. Entities are instrumental in&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tco-url-wrapper">resolving URLs</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Places</strong> -&nbsp;Places are specific, named locations with corresponding geo coordinates. They can be attached to&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects/tweets">Tweets</a>&nbsp;by specifying a&nbsp;<tt>place_id</tt>&nbsp;when&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/update">tweeting</a>. Tweets associated with places are not necessarily issued from that location but could also potentially be&nbsp;<em>about</em>&nbsp;that location.&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/geo/id/%3Aplace_id">Places</a>&nbsp;can be&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/geo/place">created</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/geo/search">searched for</a>. Tweets can also be&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/places/finding-tweets-about-places">found</a>&nbsp;by place_id.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>It is a creative way to educate users about the Twitter API, making it more visually appealing. Beyond that, I'm not sure it helps developers get up and running using the API, but who knows...it might make it more accessible to some users.</span></p>
<p><span>Have you seen any other creative wasy of displaying API documentaton?</span></p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/05/03/apis-help-deliver-on-early-visions-of-the-internet/">APIs Help Deliver on Early Visions of the Internet</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">03 May 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/internet-commerce.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As my professional career moved online during the years between 1995 and 2000, I had numerous visions about what the World Wide Web could do for businesses.  I think I shared these visions with millions of other individuals, fueling what we now know as the first Internet bubble.</p>
<p>I saw e-commerce driving entirely new businesses that could operate entirely online, and strengthen existing brick and mortar businesses allowing anyone to buy and sell goods and services from anywhere, instantly.</p>
<p>What we ended up with was still important, but the web 1.0 world was not quite as grand as I think some of us had envisioned.   <a title="E-Bay History of APIs" href="/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">E-Bay</a>, <a title="Amazon History of APIs" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a> and Paypal definitely went further than many e-commerce platforms and service providers, and I firmly believe their embrace of web APIs was the reason for this.</p>
<p>While e-commerce has undeniably grown and evolved, other new concepts like social and cloud computing took center stage in creating an entirely new vision of the Internet, concepts we didn&rsquo;t even conceive in the early days of the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>Years later, driven by APIs, I think we are just now beginning to deliver on the early visions of commerce on the Internet.  <a title="E-commerce APIs like ElasticPath" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/">E-commerce APIs like ElasticPath</a> are delivering on this vision by offering up a mature and robust <a title="e-commerce engine" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/products/features">e-commerce engine</a> completely accessible by a truly RESTful API.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/elasticpath/elasticpath-logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Using ElasticPath you can define and execute against any vision of commerce whether it involves physical or virtual goods, with any type of pricing, offers or subscriptions that enable purchasing of these products on truly any platform or any device, in a myriad of ways only limited by your imagination.</p>
<p>ElasticPath delivers by starting with a hardened and complete e-commerce engine that drives clients like Google and Sony, and proven by driving extreme online and offline commerce scenarios like the <a title="Vancouver Winter Olympics" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/company/news/2007/vancouver-2010-olympics">Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics</a>.  Next ElasticPath bundles a robust Level 3 REST API with the their e-commerce engine, providing not just programmatic access to every aspect of the e-commerce engine, but a hypermedia driven experience ensuring developers can deliver on the business logic and user experience defined by any company that deploys their e-commerce platform using ElasticPath.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/elasticpath/elasticpath-api.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with Level 3 REST also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State</a> (HATEOAS), it is an enhancement to REST, that enables a client to have no prior knowledge about how to interact with any particular application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia.  So in the context of e-commerce, when a developer requests a product the API, you get back the usual JSON describing the product, but you also get supporting media types for these &ldquo;products&rdquo;, and supporting link relations.  So if purchasing the product means streaming in media player you will get media types as well as link to load into player, where if it is a product that you can add to shopping cart, you will get the link to add to cart, and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still learning about the technical details and benefits of HATEOAS REST, but i can see the benefits when bundled with ElasticPath&rsquo;s very mature e-commerce engine.  It allows you to not only build robust product catalogs that drive your website, but an e-commerce engine that can drive digital commerce across multiple platforms and devices, without developers having to fully understand the business rules and logic set forth by your company, leaving them to do what they do best, while ensuring your products, information and brand are reflected wherever your conducting e-commerce.</p>
<p>I guess e-commerce isn&rsquo;t the only vision of the Internet, but it definitely is a large part of it, and I think APIs have been fueling the growth of e-commerce since the first part of the last decade, and now with platforms like <a title="ElasticPath" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/">ElasticPath</a> we will truly see this vision mature and allow us to sell physical and digital goods anywhere in the world, in real-time.</p>

<p>The best thing about owning <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> is I get to write about whatever I want.  I have full editorial control, and because of my unique view on the API space I tend to write about APIs from three separate perspectives:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>API Owner</li>
<li>API Service Provider</li>
<li>Developer</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the three main actors in the API game.  There are others, but these are the three viewpoints I write about the most.  I tend to rail on API owners a lot, and today I think I will rail on API developers.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m doing a lot of reaching out to my developers.  I personally email everyone who registers for CityGrid APIs.  Sure I use template emails, but I customize them and send the email one by one so I can <a title="profile my API developers" href="/2012/04/17/profiling-api-developers/index.php">profile my API developers</a> and understand what they are doing.</p>
<p>So far, my findings are that many developers don&rsquo;t have any sort of verifiable online persona, and even more don&rsquo;t bother responding when I email or tweet at them.  Its not my business to police the <a title="CityGrid APIs" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/">CityGrid APIs</a>, but I definitely apply a grade to every developer I look at, and make recommendations based upon this grade, where online persona and responsiveness are two big factors.</p>
<p>We hear a lot of developers (me included) complain about API owners not being responsive, but remember there is another side to the coin.  If you're using someone&rsquo;s API for FREE, and they take time out of their day to email you or tweet at you, it might be cool if you took 10 seconds to respond and say hello, and let them know you're an actual person.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><a title="deploying and managing APIs" href="http://www.3scale.net"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>At most <a title="Hackathons" href="/events/">hackathons</a>, the end goal is building a web or mobile application, using various platforms and APIs.  Even though I&rsquo;ve seen this evolve to data visualization, or mashing up SaaS platforms at some events, the app really tends to be the primary deliverable at hackathons.</p>
<p>So this week I&rsquo;m spending time thinking of unique and interesting ways to present my sponsors for the <a title="CityGrid hackathon this weekend in Santa Monica" href="http://citygridhackathonla.eventbrite.com/">CityGrid Hackathon this weekend in Santa Monica</a> at <a title="CoLoft" href="http://www.coloft.com/">CoLoft</a>.  One of our sponsors is <a title="3Scale API Service Provider" href="/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a>, one of my favorite API service providers, and while we see many of the API service providers including <a title="Apigee" href="/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a> and <a title="Mashery" href="/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a> involved in many of the hackathons you really don't see anything built using their platform. (I know they&rsquo;ll ping me and say they do, but really your building using their clients.)</p>
<p>So for the <a title="CityGrid Los Angeles Hackathon" href="http://citygridhackathonla.eventbrite.com/">CityGrid Los Angeles hackathon</a>, I want to encourage developers to come up with ideas for APIs, develop the API and using 3Scale, deploy the building block that are essential that enable other developers to build on top of the API.</p>
<p>Not only do we need more, high value APIs, we need developers to be fluent in not just developing and deploying mobile and web apps, developers need to be fluent in designing, developing, <a title="deploying and managing APIs" href="http://www.3scale.net">deploying and managing APIs</a>.</p>
<p>So if you have a great API idea and are in the Los Angeles area this weekend, come down to the CoLoft in Santa Monica and form a team and build your API, and deploy it using 3Scale, and you just might have a chance at winning $5,000.00 for your API.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-Developer-Blog-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of my self-appointed roles in the API industry is to shed light on, and discuss the business of APIs when many other API owners and evangelists tend to keep their strategy and business closer to their chest.</p>
<p>Many API owners don&rsquo;t discuss their roadmaps, either because they feel they will be giving away their secret sauce, or quite possibly because they don&rsquo;t have a clue where they are going with it.  I think it&rsquo;s more the latter, as we are all making this shit up as we go along.</p>
<p>One subject you don&rsquo;t hear API owners discuss often, is when their API will be deprecated or shuttered, leaving developers and tech bloggers to speculate on the subject.  Because of this you tend to hear just the extreme views on the subject.  Popular perspectives on API life-span tends to be:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>APIs Are Forever - Once you put an API, you have to support it forever</li>
<li>APIs Can Go Away Anytime - There is no stability whatsoever when it comes to APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written on this subject several times including <a href="/2012/04/09/what-happens-to-instagram-api-developers-after-facebook-acquisition/">What Happens to Instagram API Developers After Facebook Acquisition</a> and <a href="/2011/05/28/building-your-business-around-google-or-any-other-apis/">Building Your Business Around Google or Any Other APIs</a>.</p>
<p>Even with my stance on the subject I fall prey to the hype sometimes.  I saw the post from Google today called <a href="http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2012/04/changes-to-deprecation-policies-and-api.html">Changes to deprecation policies and API spring cleaning</a>, and I immediately thought oh no, here we go again.  After reading deeper I realized they are updating their API deprecation policy for many popular APIs.  As they state:</p>
<blockquote><em>The new policy simply states that we will strive to provide one year notice before making breaking changes.</em></blockquote>
<p>Google is setting a clear window, for which they will make sure and give developers a heads up before deprecating an API.  This allows you to know that you can count on an API being around, until you hear otherwise, and then, you still have a year to figure out what you are going to do.</p>
<p>I know this is something other API owners do, but it rarely is something you hear any news about, giving the API extremists free range to use page view grabbing headlines about <a href="/2012/03/30/why-tech-bloggers-suck-and-not-apis/">APIs owners being no better than satan, and eat their developers for dinner</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to work on a more formal post about API deprecation policies, and how API owners can put them to use, setting better expectations around API life cycles.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Customer-Self-Service.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of the essential ingredients of a successful API, is a self-service area to support your API developers.  In my opinion this is a no-brainer.  You have to have registration, documentation, code samples, forum and other <a title="essential building blocks" href="/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">essential API building blocks</a> available to developers in a self-service way--so they can engage with your API 24/7 without asking for access.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked hard to make sure the CityGrid API area has a logical navigation, taking developers to the essential information they will need to learn about and integrate with the APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">

<p>I keep a regular flow of information going through the blog to make sure there is excellent SEO content, so developers can search for anything at Google, and the blog will support linking to whats relevant in the <a title="CityGrid Developer Center" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid Developer Center</a>.</p>
<p>Even with all of this, I still get some pretty basic questions like:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>I need PHP code samples?</strong> - Immediately available on the code samples page.</li>
<li><strong>What does the API cost?</strong> -  Says that it is FREE on Getting Started and FAQ.</li>
<li><strong>Can I save your data in my database? </strong>- Says it on the Usage Requirements</li>
<li><strong>Do I have to show your logo?</strong> - Says it on the Usage Requirements</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/building%20blocks.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>That is just the tip of the iceberg.   I&rsquo;ve posed this question before...<a title="Are there enough doers to make this whole API vision work?" href="/2012/02/13/are-there-enough-doers-for-this-api-vision-to-work/">are there enough doers in the world to make this whole API vision work?</a> It&rsquo;s hard to tell if its just my view, while in the pit of despair, or if it is just the way it is.</p>
<p>It seems like there will always be some users who need hand holding, and they refuse to read the self-service material available in the API area.  When I&rsquo;m hacking on an API, I always make sure I search exhaustively before I ask a question, but I&rsquo;m discovering a new breed of developers who won&rsquo;t search, won&rsquo;t ask questions--then when you reach out to them they&rsquo;ll ask for what they need, no matter how basic.</p>
<p>It seems, that self-service API resources are essential, but there will always be a segment of our audience who aren&rsquo;t quite doers, they need more hand-holding and information presented to them before they get what they need.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/developer-profiling.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>For the last couple weeks I&rsquo;m neck deep in getting to know the developers who already use the <a title="CityGrid Developers" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid APIs</a>.  I want a better understanding of who a developer is, what kind of business they have and what they are looking to get out of the API.</p>
<p>To find this out I start out profiling them socially using <a title="Rapportive" href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a>&nbsp;(which I plan on automating using the&nbsp;<a title="Full Contact API" href="http://www.fullcontact.com/">Full Contact API</a> as soon as I have more time) for the following information:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Twitter Profile</li>
<li>LinkedIn Account</li>
<li>Facebook Profile</li>
<li>Google + Profile</li>
<li>Github Profile</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually I know the URL of their website, but if I don&rsquo;t, I can extract from their email address or sometimes Rapportive will provide for me. I visit each developer&rsquo;s site and look for:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Blog w/ RSS Feed</li>
<li>Business Contact Email </li>
<li>Business Contact Form</li>
</ul>
<p>Next I build a quick one sentence description, telling me who they are and what they do.  I also assemble a comma separated list of keyword and key phrases that best represent what they do.</p>
<p>Before I&rsquo;m done looking around their site I take a picture of their home page, so I have a visual reference to go with the developer profile. The home page image can go further than just a logo sometimes.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/API-Developer-Profiling-1.png" alt="" width="500" align="center" /></p>
<p>I take all of this information, put it into a database, and connected it to a JQuery Carousel that allows me to watch a slideshow that walks me through the world of my developers, and watch like a TV channel.</p>
<p>This process not only gives me a 100K understanding my developer ecosystem, but helps me remember as much as I can about each developer.  From this I hope to better engage them on a daily basis as well as provide feedback to the CityGrid API roadmap based upon quality API developer segmentation.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://citygridhackathonla.eventbrite.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/citygrid-la-hackathon/citygrid-los-angeles.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently planning a 9 city hackathon tour, starting with the <a href="http://citygridhackathonla.eventbrite.com/">CityGrid Los Angeles Hackathon</a>, and following up with Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, NYC, Baltimore, New Orleans, and Austin.</p>
<p>The CityGrid Hackathon tour is meant to bring together commercial and civic hackers to build the next generation of apps we use in our everyday "local" lives.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to find a blend of developers, business, marketing and advertising folks that will come together and develop commercially viable ideas that can also make our cities better places to live.</p>
<p>So I'm looking for sponsors that really enhance the local theme of the event, so I started with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Local API Stack" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/tag/stack/">Local API Stack</a></strong> - These are APIs that I track on for CityGrid, providing direct value to local mobile and web app developers.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Mobile Back-end as a Service Providers" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/mobile-backend-as-a-service-roundup/">Mobile Back-end as a Service</a></strong> - Service providers that exclusively provide back-end platforms and tools for mobile developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy if all of these companies could provide the sponsorships that I need to support the event, but it probably won&rsquo;t be enough.  So I&rsquo;m looking elsewhere with some of the usual suspects like Amazon Web Services, Rackspace and Twilio.</p>
<p>Regardless of what my sponsor line-up looks like I think I will still provide a directory of local APIs for developers to use, so that they have a robust listing of high quality APIs to choose from when building their local web and mobile apps.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Apr 2012</span>
        <p>When I was a tech blogger for <a href="http://readwriteweb.com">ReadWriteWeb</a> and API-related news broke, we writers would often shudder. &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t use API in the headline,&rdquo; the argument in the newsroom went. It&rsquo;s the page-view-kiss-of-death. That&rsquo;s not because APIs aren&rsquo;t super-important or super-ubiquitous on the Web (they are both). It&rsquo;s because most &ldquo;<a href="http://cdixon.org/2010/01/22/techies-and-normals/">normals</a>&rdquo; don&rsquo;t know what they are or why they matter. They&rsquo;d rather click on a story that says &ldquo;101 Ways to Use Pinterest to Plan Your Wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The decision to cover APIs regularly on ReadWriteWeb and eschew stories that fall into the &ldquo;[Number] Ways to Use [Hot New Social Media Tool] to [Conduct a Seasonally-Relevant Activity]&rdquo; goes a long way to explain the popularity of RWW versus that of Mashable, incidentally.</p>
<p>Also incidentally: Pinterest <a href="http://tijn.bo.lt/pinterest-api">has an API</a>.</p>
<p>This all presents a bit of a challenge, of course, if I want to make an argument for my readers here about why APIs really matter in education. Do I frame the argument for &ldquo;normals&rdquo;? (Wait! HA! &ldquo;Normals&rdquo; don&rsquo;t read Hack Education!) Do I frame it for educators? Entrepreneurs? Technologists? The answer: hopefully all of the above.</p>
<h2 id="whatisanapi">What is an API?</h2>
<p>API stands for &ldquo;Application Programming Interface.&rdquo; At its most basic level, an API allows one app to talk to another app. It&rsquo;s the way in which Web and mobile technologies can open up their data and their software&rsquo;s functionality to others. It&rsquo;s how Zynga integrates its games with your Facebook profile. It&rsquo;s how websites handle accepting payments via Paypal and play YouTube videos. It&rsquo;s how Instagram can share your photos to Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and Tumblr.</p>
<p>Rather than having to export a file from one system, then import it into another, APIs allow programs to &ldquo;make calls,&rdquo; sending and receiving just the information they need just when they need it. Web APIs (also known as REST APIs) do this &ndash; well obviously &ndash; via the Web using the protocols of the Web (HTTP). But instead of returning HTML like a website does when you &ldquo;call&rdquo; it, Web APIs return XML or JSON &ndash; that is, machine-readable data that other apps and websites can make us of.</p>
<p>But enough with the tech&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="whydoesthismatterineducation">Why does this matter in education?</h2>
<p>Educational data is <a href="/2012/04/11/download-all-your-education-data-with-the-click-of-one-button/">stuck in silos</a>, something fostered by educational software &ndash; administrative and instructional &ndash; that makes it cumbersome at best and impossible at worst to move data in and out of systems. As a result, there&rsquo;s lots of extra clerical work that educators and administrators have to do &ndash; recreating rosters, copying grades, downloading CSVs, copying-and-pasting, and so on. All because educational apps and software do not, as a rule, talk to one another.</p>
<p>Student Information Systems don&rsquo;t know which level of Angry Birds students are on. (Um hello, don&rsquo;t laugh: <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/04/another-gravitational-experiment-in-angry-birds-space/">Angry Birds is science</a>!) A better example, perhaps: a school&rsquo;s SIS might not talk to the district&rsquo;s database or the state&rsquo;s records system. Parents probably don&rsquo;t get an automatic SMS when there&rsquo;s an attendance issue or library book due. Learning management systems don&rsquo;t automatically capture what or how far students have read in their e-readers or what they&rsquo;ve annotated.</p>
<p>These functionalities (and lots more) are possible when there are APIs, opening the door to all sorts of <em>real-time</em> connections between products, services, and systems that are currently impossible due to time constraints, burdensome download and data entry processes, and vendors who&rsquo;d prefer to maintain data lock-in.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/darcy_modified.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="wherearetheeduapis">Where are the EDU APIs?</h2>
<p>The absence of APIs from a lot of education applications, I&rsquo;d argue, is a good indication that we&rsquo;re still dealing in many cases with pre-Web era technologies (or at least a pre-Web era mindframe). Student information systems. Learning management systems. Educational software for your desktop computer. All pre-Web. And even newer versions of these older systems often carry forward this legacy of a world without Web (or hell, even Internet) connectivity.</p>
<p>APIs played a crucial part in the explosion of Web technologies. E-commerce. Social networking. Cloud computing. Now mobile computing. All facilitated by APIs. APIs have enabled companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Twitter to become <em>platforms</em>, allowing other developers to build on top of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Platforms&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t necessarily something we talk about in education, although they do exist and are being developed <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2011/10/13/the-race-to-platform-education/">with increasing frequency</a>. Google Apps for Education is certainly an example of one. <a href="http://edmodo.com">Edmodo</a> is attempting to carve a similar path, and with the release its API last month, I described the startup as making the move &ldquo;<a href="/2012/03/06/edmodo-makes-the-move-from-social-network-to-education-platform/">from social network to education platform</a>.&rdquo; Edmodo&rsquo;s and Google&rsquo;s APIs allows other companies &ndash; <a href="http://mathalicious.com">Mathalicious</a>, <a href="http://desmos.com">Desmos</a>, <a href="http://aviary.com">Aviary</a>, for example &ndash; to connect their apps to these platforms, tapping into rosters, roles, feeds, assignments, calendars, documents and so on.</p>
<p>The LMS could be a platform too, I suppose &ndash; <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/">and with APIs, that&rsquo;s the direction it could go</a>. But what&rsquo;s interesting to me is that, with their origins in a pre Web 2.0 world, LMSes have devised a separate standard to offer connections to external modules &ndash; &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/lti/">LTI</a>,&rdquo; not API. Is there widespread interest among third-party developers to integrate with LMSes via LTI? (To make the process simpler, <a href="https://lti-examples.heroku.com/index.html">Instructure co-founder Brian Whitmer has created a site</a> with examples and code samples.) Or will the pervasiveness of Web APIs mean that developers' interest goes elsewhere?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m veering dangerously back into the technical realm here &ndash; the type of discussions that, as I started this post, tend to make &ldquo;normals&rdquo; not read and not care about APIs.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re incredibly important, why we should pay attention to them in education, and why I recommend having an API is something you should look for in the tools you adopt: APIs make data accessible. APIs foster interoperability. APIs extend functionality. And APIs create an ecosystem -- of technology, of developers, of users. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We want that for ed-tech, don't we?</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/instagram.PNG" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was going to write this story when I got an email from <a title="Qwerly" href="http://qwerly.com/letter.html">Qwerly after they got acquired by Fliptop</a>, then after <a href="http://urbanairship.com/blog/2012/01/12/update-on-our-plan-to-integrate-location-and-context-services-into-our-push-messaging-platform/">SimpleGeo was acquired by Urban Airship</a>, then when I got the email from <a href="http://blog.indextank.com/1221/indextank-linkedin-acquires-indextank/">LinkedIn announcing they were shutting down IndexTank</a>.  Four acquisitions later, I&rsquo;m finally making time today after the announcement of <a title="Facebook Acquiring Instagram" href="http://tmblr.co/ZMPd3xJMuYI9">Facebook acquiring Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>So, what will happen to Instagram API developers, now that Instagram is owned by Facebook?  We don&rsquo;t know.  It <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/04/09/facebook-probably-wont-kill-the-instagram-api/">sounds like Facebook will keep Instagram in tact</a>, but who knows where it will go from here, where founder Kevin Systrom will take it, or Facebook will step in and make changes.</p>
<p>If your like <a title="Postagram" href="http://postagramapp.com/">Postagram</a>, you&rsquo;ve already diversified beyond the Instagram API and acknowledged that you need to offer more than what you can build off a single API provider.  We&rsquo;ve hear the cry of many developers when Twitter poaches from its ecosystem, <a title="Google decide to shutter Google Translate" href="/2011/05/28/building-your-business-around-google-or-any-other-apis/">Google decided to shutter Google Translate</a>, then quickly <a href="/2011/08/25/paid-version-of-google-translate-api/">decided to offer paid version</a>--it doesn&rsquo;t matter who your API provider is, nobody is immune from acquisition or their API service being shuttered.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask the question about Instagram API developers before the API haters, jump in and blame the API.  Its not about the API, its about the API owners acknowledging their API ecosystem exists, and its developers, and whether or not they have a solid business strategy that includes having multiple suppliers for their content and products.</p>
<p>Hopefully you are a developer that understands the APIs you use to power your web or mobile application are potential vendors that could stay around for the next 10 years, or they could go away tomorrow with the next billion dollar acquisition--and with the right business strategy, maybe you could walk away with $400 Million, with your 40% equity, when your killer app is acquired.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hacker-storytelling/ada-the-enchantress-of-numbers.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hacker-storytelling/ada-the-enchantress-of-numbers.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>A big part of API evangelism, is storytelling.  Storytelling about the API, the value it delivers, and the solutions it provides.  Through my own hacking on an API, engaging with developers via email, a forum and social media, I gather ideas for projects that would help evangelize an API, while also educating users of how it works.</p>
<p>One example is a recurring question I get from <a title="CityGrid API Developers" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid API developers</a>--how does CityGrid compare with other places APIs like Google Places and Yelp?</p>
<p>I set out to answer this question, quickly realizing it was easier said than done.  I found 11 places APIs that fit my criteria, and they had many differences, so I started by writing a quick <a title="overview of the 11 places apis" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/overview-of-11-places-data-apis/">overview of the 11 places APIs</a>.  This helped me identify and quickly understand what each places API delivered.</p>
<p>Then I realized that I needed to actually hack on each API to truly understand how they work, and develop enough of an understanding where I could compare them in detail.  To do this, I needed a project, to use as a anchor for my storytelling.  Not just one blog post, but many, with code samples and starter kits to help support the project.</p>
<p>I chose to build an <a title="Interactive Places API Comparison Tool" href="http://places-comparison-v1.hyp3rl0cal.com/index.php">Interactive Places API Comparison Tool.</a></p>
<p><a title="Interactive Places API Comparison Tool" href="http://places-comparison-v1.hyp3rl0cal.com/index.php"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CityGrid-Google-Yelp-1024x189.png" alt="" width="500" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>As a start, I chose 3 places APIs to compare:  <a title="CityGrid" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid</a>, <a title="Google" href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/">Google</a> and <a title="Yelp" href="http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview">Yelp</a>.  The Interactive Places API Comparison Tool provides a what and where textual search as well as a latitude and longitude search, simultaneously across the 3 APIs.</p>
<p>Once I built the first prototype I <a href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/interactive-places-api-comparison-for-citygrid-google-and-yelp/">blogged about the comparison tool for the first time</a>, as well as some of the research that went into it, like <a title="places api comparison" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/interactive-places-api-comparison-for-citygrid-google-and-yelp/">Places API request format comparison</a>--talking about how CityGrid, Google and Yelp each tailored their API requests.</p>
<p>Today I finished a report to support the what and where search and one for the latitude and longitude search.  The report shows what was searched for, how many listings were pulled from each API and number of images, offers, reviews and tips for each place returned.  I will be adding other reporting items in the future.</p>
<p>So far I&rsquo;ve produced a lot of quality content from this hacker storytelling project:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>5 Blog Posts</li>
<li>Interactive API Comparison Web Application</li>
<li>Code Samples for Searching and Pulling Places Detail for 3 APIs</li>
<li>Code Libraries for Each of the 3 APIs</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hacker-storytelling/Hyp3rL0cal-Interactive-Places-API-Comparison-Tool-Listing.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>All blog posts are syndicated out to Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook as well as bookmarked at Reddit, StumbleUpon and Hacker News.  All code samples live as Github Gists so I can embed in blog posts and other places, while code libraries live as Github repositories.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to post a bew blog post about the Interactive Places API Comparison reports I just finished, and will be adding Factual and Foursquare to the list of APIs that are compared as part of the tool.  This will give me probably four or five more blog stories in the next couple days.</p>
<p>It is hard to tell where the project will go after that.  The good hacker storytelling projects just keep living and producing blog posts, code samples, code libraries and starter kits.  But there will always be new ideas for projects and stories when I engage with developers within the API community and on the open Internet.</p>

<p>While assembling the building blocks for a successful API ecosystem, one of the requests I get from developers is for tools to help them build successful integrations with existing platforms like Wordpress, Drupal, Facebook and Salesforce.</p>
<p>Some of the requests I get are from non-developers who just want a plug and play tool, they can deploy without needing to write code--but many of the requests are for white label, starter kits that developers can use to quickly deploy API driven applications on popular platforms like:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Wordpress" href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a></li>
<li><a title="Drupal" href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a></li>
<li><a title="Facebook" href="http://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a title="Salesforce" href="http://developer.force.com/">Salesforce</a></li>
<li><a title="Joomla" href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert in any of these platforms, but I find the more I dive into developing on these platforms, the more I learn and the more I discover other experts who really understand the ins and outs of building plugins and add-ons for 3rd party systems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to building code samples, code libraries and generic start kits for your API, you may want to take a look at building white label, 3rd party platform plugins and add-ons your developers can use to quickly integrate your API into existing networks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At the very least, you will learn a lot.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Mar 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-api.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I read a post over at <a title="Cloud Ave" href="http://www.cloudave.com/">Cloud Ave</a> today by Martijn Linssen, <a title="Why API&rsquo;s suck, and what they lack" href="http://www.cloudave.com/18470/why-apis-suck-and-what-they-lack/">Why API&rsquo;s suck, and what they lack</a>. &nbsp;I'll start by saying, everything he says about APIs, can be true for some APIs, but the post has more to do with the state of tech blogging, than anything to do with APIs.</p>
<p>To Linssen's points:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>First of all, API&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t open</strong> - True many APIs use this term, without it being true.  But those of in the industry who get it, call these "public" APIs and have stopped using the term "open".  Open has been used by a few bad marketing seeds, and perpetuated by the blogosphere.</li>
<li><strong>Second of all, API&rsquo;s are for free, mostly, and no uptime is guaranteed -</strong> What? Really?  Maybe the 10 you've tried don't, but many of the APIs I depend on do.  Just to name a few:&nbsp;<a title="Google Maps" href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/earthmaps/maps_sla.html">Google Maps</a>,&nbsp;<a title="WebServius" href="http://www.webservius.com/corp/sla.html">WebServius</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Datasift" href="http://datasift.com/terms/sla">Datasift</a>,&nbsp;<a title="http://zencoder.com/sla/" href="http://zencoder.com/sla/">Zencoder</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Amazon EC2" href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2-sla/Amazon S3">Amazon EC2</a>, <a title="Amazon S3" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3-sla/">Amazon S3</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Third, API&rsquo;s are badly documented, if any </strong>- Sure this can be a problem, and is something everyone is working on. This doesn't point to APIs sucking, more the documentation. &nbsp;Can you point me to the documentation you&rsquo;ve maintained?  Its&rsquo; not as easy as it looks.  And there are plenty of shining examples of how do you do it right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok those are your points?  And you went to <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> and looked at 10 APIs?  And you came to the conclusion all APIs suck?  I've spent hundreds of hours looking through ALL of the APIs in the ProgrammableWeb directory, and yes there is a lot of shit in there.  But there are some really amazing examples of the API vision, that you seem to be bothered by.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you hacked on <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>?  Twilio rocks!  Have you used <a title="Stripe" href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>?  Seen the forwarding thinking e-commerce APIs <a title="ElasticPath" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/">ElasticPath</a> is working on? Have you hacked on any of the 97+ Google APIs lately?  They have come a really long way in pulling together their interfaces, standardizing documentation, making legal easier to use, and standardizing what is free and what is billing.</p>
<p>Linssen seems caught up on the fact that all APIs are some sort of social bullshit.  I counter with the fact that the last 5 years of Internet growth has been build on the back of Amazon Web Services, via APIs.  When I started using both EC2 and S3, it was all APIs, there were no interfaces.  I&rsquo;ve deployed, scaled and supported global infrastructure with millions of dollars running through those APIs, personally.</p>
<p>My recommendation to Linssen is he spend more time hacking on APIs, and look at the playing field a little more before you professionally blog on the subject.  But that brings me back to my title, and the fact that his blog post is about page views, and not about APIs, which represents the state of tech blogosphere and not APIs.</p>
<p>I just went over to Techmeme and look at the top 10 stories, and I decided that all tech bloggers suck and I'll stop reading tech blogs all together.  Actually no..I'll keep doing what I do with all tech blogs, evaluate them one by one and unsubscribe when they stop offering value. Much like you should do with APIs.</p>

<p>The largest portion of my time as API Evangelist is spent keeping the area around an API active.  Your developer&rsquo;s first impression when they enter your API area is critical, and if they see signs that your API is inactive, they might start looking elsewhere.</p>
<p>The most common ways I keep an API active is by:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Blogging</li>
<li>Tweeting w/ Twitter Feature in API Area</li>
<li>Forum Posts</li>
<li>How-Tos</li>
<li>Starter Projects</li>
<li>Developer Showcase</li>
</ul>
<p>By actively posting content in these areas w/ timestamps showing when they were posted, I keep the API area looking like someone is home.</p>
<p>This active content doesn&rsquo;t just help developers visiting the site feel like the API is active, it also helps your SEO. Search engines and social networks will regularly index your content, providing fresh traffic, and potentially new developers to your API.</p>
<p>Just a couple hours a day, generating fresh content and engaging with your developers goes a long ways in attracting new developers and making them feel confident that your API is a priority, and they should integrate it into their applications.</p>

<p>There was a great article in the Oregonian out of Portland called, "<a title="Intel 'Code for Good' hackathon helps nonprofits solve technology challenges" href="http://www.oregonlive.com/hillsboro/index.ssf/2012/03/intel_code_for_good_hackathon.html">Intel 'Code for Good' hackathon helps nonprofits solve technology challenges</a>".</p>
<p>The theme for the hackathon: <strong>Girls in education</strong></p>
<p>Code for Good co-organizer Josh Bancroft worked with co-organizer Renee Kuriyan and employees in Intel's corporate affairs group to help four nonprofit organizations, <a href="http://www.worldpulse.com/">World Pulse</a>, a Portland-based nonprofit; <a href="http://www.roomtoread.org/">Room to Read</a>; <a href="http://10x10act.org/">10X10: Educate Girls Change the World</a>; and <a href="http://www.campaignforeducation.org/">Global Campaign for Education</a>.</p>
<p>"I felt like we could amplify the impact" by software and corporate working together, Bancroft said. The partnerships were already established by corporate affairs, and the software group simply brought the technical expertise.</p>
<p>Their task was to create software solutions to real-world problems facing girls in education, and for each team to develop an app by the end of the day that the nonprofits could then put to use. The hackathon theme is part of <a href="http://www.intel.com/shewill">Intel's "She Will"</a> campaign and with the company's overarching mission to "create and extend computing technology to connect and enrich the lives of every person on Earth."</p>
<p>You can read more about the great hackathon over at <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/hillsboro/index.ssf/2012/03/intel_code_for_good_hackathon.html">Oregon Live</a>.&nbsp;I just wanted to point out that not all hackathons are male dominated, and the model can go much further than some of what we see coming out of Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>Every Monday I generate a list of all new API developer who registered for the&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid&nbsp;API</a>&nbsp;the week before.  This list has the name and email address for each developer, and I manually go down the list, and email them individually, letting them know I&rsquo;m here to help.</p>
<p>As I email each new API developer I use <a href="/2012/01/23/engaging-my-api-developers-immediately-with-rapportive/">Rapportive to identify more information about them</a>, such as their website URL, Twitter and LinkedIn profile.  If a developer has a Twitter or LinkedIn profile, I engage them on those networks.</p>
<p>After 3 months of doing this, I&rsquo;ve noticed that developers who work for larger companies have LinkedIn profiles and developers who either are freelance, own or work with a smaller development shop tend to have Twitter.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/twitter-logo-puffy-border.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>It makes sense.  Twitter is a more public forum, and smaller companies tend to need to market their skills and services and actively engage the world around them.  While established companies tend to keep their developers in a more closed environment, suitable for the business social network LinkedIn.</p>
<p>This type of information helps me segment my API developer audience into various groups allowing me to craft blog posts, announcements and share other information with them on appropriate channels.  I&rsquo;m not a big fan of emailing, so being able to push out information regularly on LinkedIn and Twitter, and engage with users that are active on these networks, works very well for supporting my approach to API developer support.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Mar 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-hackathon.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time trying to track on what gets created at <a title="hackathons" href="/events/">hackathons</a>. &nbsp;Some innovative programming occurs at these events and I&rsquo;d say 98% of it is forgotten by Monday morning.</p>
<p>I think a lot of attention is given to the myth that hackathons are about building startups.  When in reality, how many startups come out of hackathons?  In my opinion the top three things that come out of a hackathon are:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Marketing</strong> - For the event organizer, sponsors and for participants. </li>
<li><strong>Talent Acquisition</strong> - There is some seriously talented folks attending hackathons. </li>
<li><strong>Networking</strong> - Hackathons are a great place to meet people, network, make friends and sure maybe a co-founder. </li>
</ol>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Beyond that I think there is a lot of code that gets generated at hackathons, that really never goes anywhere.  Much of this code is not immediately VC fundable, but still some of it is really good.  And I see a lot of kids spending whole weekends writing the same or similar code as I saw the weekend before.</p>
<p>To help remedy this, I suggest that event organizers use&nbsp;<a title="Github" href="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github-logo.png">Github</a>.  Just like every <a href="/2012/01/08/hashtag-for-your-hackathon/">hackathon organizer should identify a Twitter #hashtag</a> for the event, you should setup a Github organization and add your hackers as users.  Encourage them to commit their code through-out the hackathon, and wrap up the weekend with a nice README file of their project.</p>
<p>Seems like a great way to showcase what was built over the weekend, make the intellectual property open and accessible for other people to use, and make it easier for other hackathon participants to build off what has already been created in the past.</p>

        <p>Boston API Jam organizer Sqoot just got themselves into a lot of hot water with some very sexist comments on their hackathon home page (now removed):</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/sqoot/boston-api-jam.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>From what I can tell, Sqoot was called out by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/BoazSender">@BoazSender</a>:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/sqoot/Sqoot-Boaz-Sender-.png" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p>Then the pressure quickly was put on in the Twittershpere:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/sqoot/sqoot-jacobian.png" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p>Resulting in Apigee pulling their sponsorship:</p>

<p>And Heroku pulling theirs as well:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/sqoot/sqoot-heroku.png" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tCdfaMOC2xmx9LFsn7At_34uabeqjqaB4mbNjj1j4N8/preview?pli=1&amp;sle=true">Sqoot quickly released an "apology"</a> which included:</p>
<blockquote><em>"While we thought this was a fun, harmless comment poking fun at the fact that hack-a-thons are typically male-dominated, others were offended."</em></blockquote>
<p>Their "apology" definitely summarizes the misogynistic tone of the spreading Silicon Valley startup and hackathon culture.</p>
<p>This is a major problem.  One of my biggest complaints about many hackathons is that they are male dominated, and this is nothing to joke about, make fun of or take lightly.  You don&rsquo;t realize it when all you do is attend the all boy hackathons and do your bro-gramming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to hackathons where there are equal sexes, and they are awesome-- way more fun, and truly work to solve real life problems, not perceived problems.</p>
<p>I hope other blogs will publicize this, and make other hackathon organizers aware so this kind of shit doesn&rsquo;t not only go away, but we start working the other direction and making sure <strong>EVERYONE</strong> feels welcome at hackathons.</p>

<p>My recommendation to API owners is to always have a blog, however one the most damaging things you can do is stop posting to your blog.  A blog is a key variable in my <a title="API Stack Algorithm" href="/2012/03/15/qualifying-for-the-api-stack/">API Stack algorithm</a>, of whether or not an API is worth integrating with, and if you haven&rsquo;t updated your blog anytime in the last year, I immediately step away.</p>
<p>If you want people to find your API, have a blog.  If you want your existing developers to be educated about what can be done with your API, have blog.  If you want developers who find your API, to feel confident enough to integrate it into their app, keep you blog updated!</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.geoiq.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/geoiq/geoiq-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going through hundreds of APIs and curating a list of APIs, for what I&rsquo;m calling the API Stack. &nbsp;The API Stack consists of APIs that provide clear value for developers and have demonstrated real investment in their API, and are in it for long haul.</p>
<p>There are quite a few things I consider when looking at an API, here are a few:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Value</strong> - The API offers clear value to developers, without needing an explanation.</li>
<li><strong>Web API</strong> - They don&rsquo;t have to be 100% REST, but web APIs make developers lives easier.</li>
<li><strong>Active Blog w/ RSS</strong> - A blog is a quick way to see what is behind the curtain of an API.  If they care enough to have a blog, and communicate with developers, and keep it active it demonstrates they care.  With an RSS feed I can programmatically understand whether they are active or not.</li>
<li><strong>Active Forum w/ RSS</strong> - A forum gives developers a voice and also shows an API owner cares what developers thinks, and is willing to support a large community.  An active forum is a positive sign of an API, and the RSS feed also gives me a programmatic way to assess.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - An active Twitter presence is a pretty key metric in understanding the value of an API.  If the company has the resources to actively engage developers via Twitter, they care.  And again I can programmatically monitor and see if someone exists behind the API.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other metrics I use, but these are proving to be the most positive characteristics of an API that developers can depend on.  Many APIs I come across don&rsquo;t even meet these basic requirements.  What triggered this post, was I had just looked at about 10 APIs that did not meet these basic requirements, and then I came across one that clearly met all of these, and more--<a href="http://www.geoiq.com/">GeoIQ</a>.</p>
<p>GeoIQ has a mapping API that provides clear value to developers, and its obvious they are investing the necessary resources, so the API is successful.  So I&rsquo;m adding GeoIQ to my API stack under the category of &ldquo;local&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If you feel your API is a good fit for the API stack, make sure and ping me.</p>

<p>Social Data Analyzing API <a title="Knodes" href="http://knod.es/">Knodes</a> has just announced a $250K startup fund that will invest in the best products, websites and applications built on top of the Knodes API platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://knod.es/hot/dev">Knodes Social Data Analyzing API</a> provides developers with social data-based insights about their users across social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>With the launch of the Fund, the Knodes team is hoping to bring awareness to their API and jumpstart a new ecosystem of developers, businesses and campaigns whose next generation social applications will be powered by its API.</p>
<p><a href="http://knod.es/hot/fund">The Knodes Fund</a> which is in partnership with <a title="Quotidian Ventures" href="http://quotidianventures.com/">Quotidian Ventures</a>, will take the best websites, web and mobile applications and give them the resources they need to be successful, including up to $25,000 in equity funding, mentorship and access to new features and social intelligence available via the Social Data Analyzing API.</p>
<p>The Knodes Fund is open to all individuals and companies building an application, website or program using the Knodes API.  Applications can be submitted at Knod.es beginning May 1, 2012, and the deadline to apply for the Knodes Fund is June 1, 2012.</p>
<p><a href="http://knod.es/hot/fund"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/knodes/Knodes-Fund.png" alt="" width="500" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>The Knodes Fund represents a growing convergence of the innovation occuring within both API ecosystems and a growing number of startup incubators.  APIs provide a fertile environment to entice talented developers with fresh ideas to build new applications without commitment, while also being able to invest in successful ideas that prove themselves, bringing to life the original <a title="business development 2.0 promise of the API ecosystem" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">business development 2.0 promise of the API ecosystem</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://se.linkedin.com/in/andreaskrohn">Andreas Krohn</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://twitter.com/andreaskrohn">@andreaskrohn</a>)&nbsp;first saw the potential of APIs when he in 2005 started working with enterprise web scraping solutions at <a href="http://kapowsoftware.com/">Kapow Technologies</a> (now Kapow Software). Conceptualizing the web as one big database and creating APIs to get to that data is not that different from the REST APIs used today. When leaving Kapow to start his own <a href="http://dopter.se">company</a> it was a given that the focus would be on APIs and open data.</p>
<p>Andreas API work is focused in Sweden where he regularly speaks at conferences. Mostly he focuses on the non-technical side of APIs since APIs are doomed to fail without a good business strategy and long term marketing plan. The ones that really need to understand the potential of APIs are the business people and then focusing on the money instead of technology is the way forward. He is also providing consulting services customers regarding API strategies and technologiesone such project he has been active in is <a href="http://trafiklab.se">Trafiklab</a> which is a portal for Swedish public transport APIs. The goal of the project is to collect Swedish travel related APIs in one place with consistent documentation, API-key handling and support to make them as attractive to developers as possible.</p>
<p>He writes about APIs on Swedens leading API blog <a href="http://www.mashup.se">Mashup.se</a> and has done so for several years. The focus of Mashup.se is international API news as well as highlighting local Swedish APIs. To increase the use of Swedish APIs he has recently launched the <a href="http://www.mashup.se/apikatalog">Swedish API directory</a> listing over 200 Swedish APIs. Not much compared to the 5000+ APIs listed on <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a>, but a lot for a small country where the wave of APIs are just getting started. The development of APIs in Sweden is currently lead by government agencies and agencies due to European Union directives but Andreas hopes that showing the available private APIs will lead to a wider use of APIs and more private companies developing APIs.</p>

<p>
     <em>This post comes from the <a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://sdkbridge.com/">SDK Bridge</a> newsletter.  I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you.</em>
</p>
<p>
     People are constantly trying to come up with tools to make API documentation an easier task. If you are documenting an SDK built for C++, C#, or Java, there are tools such as Doxygen, Sandcastle, and JavaDocs to take comments from the code and automatically generate documentation from them. Why aren't there tools like this for REST APIs?
</p>
<p>
     The beauty of Web APIs is that they can be written in whatever language you like and in whatever manner you like. As long as when an HTTP request comes in, the proper HTTP response goes out, it doesn't matter how it actually happens on the server. But this very flexibility makes automated documentation nearly impossible, since there's no standard mapping between what an API request is and what the code is that generates its response.
</p>
<p>
     Nonetheless, there are some solutions out there to this problem. I need to start by saying that there are in fact two approaches to automation that are used to document REST APIs. One is similar to the tools I mentioned above, where comments are taken from code to generate the documentation. The other involves having the documentation separate from the code, but in a data format (such as JSON) that can be parsed and used to generate the documentation.
</p>
<p>
     I also should mention that documentation automation does not guarantee good documentation. Before choosing to to incorporate automation into your process, I recommend reading an excellent article by Dana Fujikawa: <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/t/" target="_blank">What to Consider Before Considering Auto-Generated Documentation</a>.
</p>
<h3>
     Automated Documentation from Code
</h3>
<p>
     There's no off-the-shelf tool that pulls documentation comments out of code that's going to work for all REST APIs. But there are two possible solutions:
</p>
<ol class="manliest">
     <li>Use a framework that both generates the APIs and the documentation
     </li>
     <li>Create methods with a one-to-one mapping with API requests.
     </li>
</ol>
<p>
     <strong>Framework.</strong> A good example of a REST API framework is <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/i/" target="_blank">Enunciate</a>. Enunciate is an open-source Java-based Web API framework. It creates full HTML documentation of the services it generates, where the documentation is assembled from JavaDocs comments.
</p>
<p>
     <strong>Mapping.</strong> Mapping requires some disciplined practices, but has the advantage that it can be used with any technology. In this case, you need to create public methods that map directly to API requests. So, for example, you might have an API request to get a brief user profile for a user with an ID of 23423 with a call like this:
</p>
<p>
     <code>GET <a href="http://api.example.com/users/23423/profile?type=brief" target="_blank">http://api.example.com/users/23423/profile?type=brief</a></code>
</p>
<p>
     When this request comes in, you need to structure your code so that it calls a method by the name of something like:
</p>
<p>
     <code>public get_users__id__profile(int id, string profile_type)</code>
</p>
<p>
     Note that the <code>id</code> is surrounded by double underlines, indicating that it is not literally the text "id".
</p>
<p>
     This method would then have comments that could be picked up by automated tool, such as JavaDoc, RDoc, or Sandcastle, and HTML documentation would be generated. Then you would need to run the HTML documentation through an automated process that would remove unnecessary information (such as class names), and convert the method names, replacing single underlines with slashes and double underlines with slashes and brackets so that
</p>
<p>
     <code>public get_users__id__profile</code>
</p>
<p>
     would become
</p>
<p>
     <code>GET /users/{id}/profile</code>
</p>
<p>
     The parameters table would also need some modification so that it's clear which parameters are part of the URL and which are query parameters.
</p>
<p>
     It's not a simple process, but I have seen it done successfully using Ruby code and <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/d/" target="_blank">RDoc</a>.

<h3>
     Automated Documentation from Structured Data
</h3>
<p>
     The advantage of taking comments from code is that if there are changes in the code, the comments are more likely to be updated. However, a simpler and very flexible solution is to have the documentation in structured data (JSON or XML), and then have an automated process create the actual HTML documentation from it. There are a several tools that will do this, merging documentation with an ability to try out the REST calls, which is extremely handy. Here are some examples.
</p>
<p>
     <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/h/" target="_blank">Swagger</a>. Swagger is a tool created by Worknik that creates very nice looking API documentation with the ability to easily try any API request. You specify a resource discovery URL which returns JSON with information about the various REST resources, then for each resource, you specify the type of operation, the path, the potential errors, and the response. Although you are limited in how long your descriptions can be, it creates a very nice documentation system for straight-forward APIs.
</p>
<p>
     <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/k/" target="_blank">I/O Docs</a>. I/O Docs is a tool created by <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/u/" target="_blank">Mashery</a> that is very similar to Swagger. The big difference is that it is open source. Written in JavaScript, the source is available on github, which means that you can taylor it to your own needs, as well as look-and-feel.
</p>
<p>
     <strong>Create your own</strong>. If neither of these tools are flexible enough for your API, you can create your own. A beautiful implementation that I had the priviledge to work on was created by <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/o/" target="_blank">Tendril</a>. Take a look at an example API request at <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/b/" target="_blank">Cost and Consumption for a Single Device</a>. You can see how you can try it out on the first tab, but then other tabs list parameters, response, and notes. By creating their own system, they were able to document a fairly complex API call which would not have worked with an off-the-shelf system.
</p>
<h3>
     Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
     Automated REST API documentation can be used to:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Keep the documentation near the code so that it's easier to update.
     </li>
     <li>Allow developers to try out of the API requests as part of the documentation.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Although it is impossible to have a tool that automatically generates REST API documentation from any code, there are a number of approaches that will let you autogenerate the documentation, including:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Using a framework that generates both the API code and its documentation.
     </li>
     <li>Creating a mapping between methods and API requests and using standard documentation tools.
     </li>
     <li>Writing documentation as structured data and generating HTML from it.
     </li>
</ul>

        <span class="post-date">05 Mar 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/forums-icon.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for new, relevant ideas to write blog posts on for the <a title="CityGrid Developer Blog" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/">CityGrid Developer blog</a>.  I have several topics I write about regularly including new projects I&rsquo;m working on, new releases around the API, and what I find during my local, mobile and social landscape analysis.</p>
<p>However it can be hard to find topics to write about that are relevant to CityGrid developers, or publishers as we call them.  To help write blog posts that are useful to my API community I started harvesting ideas and topics from actual forum posts from developers.</p>
<p>Earlier today a publisher submitted a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/citygrid-dev-talk/6x4j2g5Mqso">forum post stating their concerns about the age of some of the reviews</a> they get along with businesses, when making requests against the <a title="CityGrid Places API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API">CityGrid Places API</a>.  It was an easy question to answer, since CityGrid also provides a <a title="business reviews API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Reviews+API">business reviews API</a>, that will give you more control how you can pull reviews for a zip code, neighborhood or specific business.</p>
<p>Using the topic that was posted on the forum I was easily able to <a title="create a quick blog post" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/more-control-over-citygrid-review-api-requests/">create a quick blog</a> post framing the question and providing a detailed answer explaining how the CityGrid Reviews API provides a solution.</p>
<p>Now CityGrid publishers can potentially be exposed to this solution via the blog, RSS feed and since I actively syndicate my blog posts, they will see it if they follow CityGrid on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and also using a search engine.</p>
<p>When evangelizing for an API, I feel it is important to try and provide as helpful content as you can via an active blog presence, while also reverberating it across the multitude of channels your developers might be listening on--turning relevant forum posts into stories is a great way to do this.</p>

        <p>Since starting as <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> here at <a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygrid.com">CityGrid</a>, I have been asked a couple of times how we stack up against other places APIs.

</p>
<p>
     I am going through the <a title="Foursquare API" href="https://developer.foursquare.com">Foursquare API</a>, and found their section about how to get an increase in the number of calls you can make against the Foursquare API interesting:
</p>
<p class="c2">
     <em>If your application runs into any of our rate limits and you think you could use more, write us at api@foursquare.com. We'llneed your OAuth consumer id, an explanation about why you need an increased cap, and information about the following</em> 
</p>
<ul class="c3">
     <li>
          <em><strong>Usage</strong>: A description of the endpoints you're calling and how you're using the data retrieved. We use this to make sure you're abiding by our <a href="https://foursquare.com/legal/api/platformpolicy">Platform Policies</a> and <a href="https://foursquare.com/legal/terms">Terms of Service</a>. Sample requests are generally helpful.</em>
     </li>
     <li>
          <em><strong>Attribution</strong>: Screenshots of your application so we can confirm you're <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/attribution.html">attributing</a> foursquare correctly.</em>
     </li>
     <li>
          <em><strong>Caching</strong>: Cache venue details where appropriate to avoid making spurious requests to our servers. See theRetention section of our <a href="https://foursquare.com/legal/api/platformpolicy">Platform Policies</a> for more details.</em>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I like the idea of rewarding developers with the ability to make more calls against your API, when they adhere to your terms of service and benefit your operations.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/02/26/what-is-api-evangelist/">What is API Evangelist?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">26 Feb 2012</span>
        <p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-API-Evangelist.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     <strong><a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a></strong> has grown beyond being just a research blog. It is time for me to update the <a title="about us page" href="/about.php">about us page</a>, and its time for me to tell the story of what is "API Evangelist", and how I view my role in the API industry.
</p>
<p>
     API Evangelist started in July 2010. I was burning out in my job as VP of Technology for an events management company that managed events for SAP and Google. I was looking for a way to re-invent myself, doing something that I enjoyed, but also keep me employed for the next 5 years or more. I was looking for something that I was knowledeable about, would be around for a few years. I quickly identified web APIs as this focus.
</p>
<p>
     Web APIs had been a big part of my career since the early 2000’s. I’ve designed and consumed a lot of APIs, and they were the glue in a platform I built for my web development company Original Web Solutions, which I ran from 2000 through 2008.  But I also saw web APIs as vital, but quiet player in the growth of the Internet:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Social</strong> - Web APIs grew up along with social platforms like Flickr, Delicous, Twitter and Facebook.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Cloud</strong> - Web APIs came of age, with proving they could deploy IT infrastructure via Amazon Web Services, and are the power driving Paas and Saas.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Mobile</strong> - Web APIs are becoming ubiquitous with the growth of iOS, Android, Blackbery and Windows mobile phone usage.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     This locked it in for me. APIs were not only growing, they were going to be around for a while. So I started API Evangelist, and began researching the space, looking for a way that I could make not only a career, I could also make an impact.
</p>
<p>
     I set out, researching the space. I evaluated over 200 of the top web APIs, and wanted to understand their approach, why they were successful (or not), and who were movers and shakers in the space. I quickly saw that there were plenty of technical pundits or <span><em>RESTafarians</em></span>, who had strong opinions on technically how to deploy your APIs, but there very few people addressing the business side of API deployment and management.
</p>
<p>
     This was my angle. I would focus on the <a title="Business of APIs" href="/business_of_apis.php">business of APIs</a>, and study the approach, and building blocks that were used by successful API owners. By the end of 2010, I had my focus, and in 2011 I spent a lot of time getting to know the space, and the key players in the API industry. I met influencers such as John Musser(<a title="John Musser" href="https://twitter.com/#!/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>) of <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a>, Daniel Jacobson(<a title="Daniel Jacobson" href="https://twitter.com/#!/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>) of Netflix, Steven Willmott(<a title="Steve Willmott" href="https://twitter.com/#!/njyx">@njyx</a>) of <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net/">3Scale</a> and Sam Ramji(<a title="Sam Ramji" href="https://twitter.com/#!/sramji">@sramji</a>) of <a title="Apigee" href="http://apigee.com/">Apigee</a>.
</p>
<p>
     Throughout 2011 I developed my voice and approach to the space by blogging on <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a> and API Evangelist and being the API Evangelist for <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a>. In 2012 I feel this has moved beyond research and out of the PHD period, after 2 years exclusively focusing on the space, i feel like its a full-time career now. My role is <span class="c2">not</span> as "API Guru" as many people are quick to say, I see it as "API Luminary". All I do is shine light on what other really smart people are doing in the space, and thanks to my girlfriend Audrey Watters (<a title="Audrey Watters" href="https://twitter.com/#!/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>), I’m learning to shine the light by telling stories. Stories about the power of web APIs, and how they are transforming businesses and entire industries.
</p>
<p>
     This is my story of how I became the API Evangelist. Though I have worked to build a brand around the title, I’m not the only one out there. With the growth of APIs, there are many more API evangelist, developer evangelist and developer advocates popping up. I want to help give them a platform for telling their story of how they got where they are, and their vision of the API Industry.
</p>
<p>
     Here are a few of those stories:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Garrett Willkin - API Evangelist" href="/garrett_wilkin_api_evangelist.php">Garrett Wilkin - API Evangelist</a></strong>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     If you are an aPI evangelist, developer evangelist or developer advocate, and would like to share your story, email me at <a title="info@apievangelist.com " href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">info@apievangelist.com</a> and I’ll publish your story here.
</p>
<p>
     This blog is no longer just about me, its grown larger than that. Its become about the power of change by using web APIs, the people who are implementing that change, and the businesses and industries that are being transformed.

        <span class="post-date">26 Feb 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>When new users sign up for the <a title="CityGrid API" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com">CityGrid API</a>, I immediately get an email with their name, email and phone number, which are required for registration.  The API is self-service, and I rely on the <a title="essential building blocks" href="/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">essential building blocks</a> I&rsquo;ve assembled as part of the API area to support them in their first hours and days of integration.</p>
<p>Five days after registration, if a publishers has not reached out to the CityGrid API team, or show any usage on the API, I reach out to them via email, asking if there is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANYTHING</span></strong> I can do to make their integration successful.  I do not send an email blast, I email them one by one, and as I do this, <a title="I use rapportive in Gmail to identify if they have a twitter, linkedin or google+ account" href="/2012/01/23/engaging-my-api-developers-immediately-with-rapportive/">I use Rapportive in my Gmail to identify if they have a Twitter, Google+ or LinkedIn</a> account.  I then send a personal email, and follow them on their social networks and research their business web site, if they have one.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/LinkedIn.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say about 65% of my API users that are responsive, reply and tell me they are planning on integrating and just need more time or are waiting for the development resources to free up and then they&rsquo;ll tackle integration.  These are perfect candidates for social media, and because they are responsive they tend to follow me back on Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+.  Since I keep my social networks active on a daily basis, hopefully they&rsquo;ll see regular, informative posts from me, demonstrating not only is there a person behind the curtain at the CityGrid API, that I am actually investing in their success.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-plus/google_plus.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></p>
<p>New registrations are only one of my API success metrics.  My ultimate goal is to have them actively consuming the <a title="Places API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API">Places</a>, <a title="Reviews API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Reviews+API">Reviews</a> and <a title="Offers API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Offers+API">Offers</a> API and making money using <a title="CityGrid Mobile and Web Advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Ads+by+CityGrid">CityGrid Mobile and Web Advertising</a> and <a title="Places that Pay" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+that+Pay">Places that Pay</a>. &nbsp;To&nbsp;convert users from new to active users, I have to stay engaged with them, and I couldn&rsquo;t do this without the use of social media.</p>
