			<p><em>05 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I started beta testing a new JavaScript library, combined with API, that I&rsquo;m calling linkrot.js. My goal is to address link rot across my blogs. There are two main reasons links are bad on my site, either I moved the page or resource, or a website or other resource has gone away.
To help address this problem, I wrote a simple JavaScript file that lives in the footer of my blog, and when the page loads, it spiders all the links on the page, combining them into a single list and then makes a call to the linkrot.js API.
All new links will get a URL shortener applied, as well as a screenshot taken of the page. Every night a script will run to check the HTTP status of each link used in my site&mdash;verifying the page exists, and is a valid link.
Every time link rot.js loads, it will spider the links available in the page, sync with linkrot.js API, and the API returns the corresponding shortened URL, or if a link shows a 404 status, the link will no longer link to page, it will popup the last screenshot of the page, identifying the page no longer exists.
Eventually I will be developing a dashboard, allowing me to manage the link rot across my websites, make suggestions on links I can fix, provides a visual screen capture of those I cannot, while also adding a new analytics layer by implementing shortened URLs.
Linkrot.js is just an internal tool I&rsquo;m developing in private beta. Once I get up and running, Audrey will beta test, and we&rsquo;ll see where it goes from there. Who knows!

			<p><em>05 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>
Even with the risk of possible creating some sort of API wormhole, I just added the API Commons API to the API Commons. The API for adding and searching for APIs that are in the commons, now has an API definition that is publicly declared as part of the commons, with a CC-BY license.
It just makes sense to have the API for the commons in the commons, so anyone can establish their own commons, complete with common API. 3Scale and API Evangelist are taking a particular stance on the API copyright discussion, and if our approach doesn&rsquo;t match your vision of the API economy, we encourage you to fork and establish your own commons.
We only launched the API Commons API two months ago, so the definition is still fairly new, and we would love to hear your thoughts on the API definition, and the underlying format of the API Commons Manifest. It is up to all of us to help keep the surface area of the API economy as open, accessible, reusable and interoperable as possible.

			<p><em>04 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of watching Romain Huet (@romainhuet), developer evangelist at Twitter, give his very entertaining talk three times now, and if you haven&rsquo;t seen it, I recommend looking it up on the APIStrat Youtube channel. Romain walks us through the world of Twitter, showing us the power of the platform and its API, but the really entertaining part is the two Internet of things (Iot) demos that he executes during his talk. The first demo Romain does, is taking an audience selfie using a Raspberry Pi driven camera, triggered by a Tweet. The second demo involves flying a quadcopter drone on stage, that uses NodeCopter&nbsp;as the&nbsp;interface, and Twitter as the communication layer. Both demos are crowd pleasers, which makes for not just an entertaining talk, but shows the potential of Iot + APIs, while also making the audience part of the experience. I think the demos that Romain delivers are important, because they offer a unique learnng gateway to both Iot and APIs. While Twitter as a communication layer for the Internet of things may not be a scalable, production ready solution for talking to devices, I think it is a great learning platform for individuals to learn not just about APIs, but how APIs can be used to communicate with the devices in their world. Simple Communication Twitter is a simple communication platform, which posseses a social graph that is easy to understand by people who are new to the world of APIs. When individuals are experimenting with both APIs and Iot, Twitter provides a great 101 level sandbox to learn from fun, simple, meaningful IoT + API tutorials. Simple API The Twitter API is very mature, providing a simple, yet robust communication API to jumpstart their education. The overhead to get up and running on Twitter API by new users is very low, and with simple tutorials based upon demos like Romain&rsquo;s selfie photo, and drone, the platform provides a great...[<a href="/2014/06/04/twitter-as-the-platform-for-learning-about-apis-and-the-internet-of-things/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;ve been following the work of Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read for some time now. In my opinion this work is some of the most important legal work out there right now, which is guiding all of our activity not just online, but increasingly in our offline worlds. If you aren't familiar with Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read, I think their slogan sums it up well:
&ldquo;I have read and agree to the Terms&rdquo; is the biggest lie on the web. We aim to fix that.
More clarity and balance in the terms of service that online services employ is critical to the future of society and the web, this single checkbox is deciding our fate, whether you realize it or not. One of the projects I&rsquo;m working on in coming months, is forking and extending the Terms of Service Didn't Read work into the world of APIs.
While I was aware that the Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read work is openly licensed, I wasn't aware of the degree of openness, until I started digging through their Github account and found machine readable inventory of the questions they ask of TOS. This is huge!
To achieve their rating of each online service, TOS Didn't Read asks questions of each service providers TOS. This list of questions is critical to making sense of the complex legalese that TOS contain, allowing for them to derive a rating for each service, and provide a list of plain english description of what you face when signing up for each online service.
In coming months, I will be working on a forked version of TOS Didn't Read, applying their machine readable questions specifically to APIs, and hopefully contributing cycles to the central TOS Didn&rsquo;t Read. My intention is to make machine readable API definitions for this critical building block of the API economy.

			<p><em>04 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m an advisor to the camera API platform, EverCam. I don&rsquo;t advise the startup because I&rsquo;m super excited about the opportunities for APIs for security cameras. I'm involved because I believe in the Evercam team, and I want to be aware of this fast growing aspect of the Internet of things and API economy. Security cameras are not going away, and I want to help lend some critical thought to how we use security cameras, and apply APIs to help introduce transparency and accountability into this easily abused layer of our society. One of the things I learned from Evercam, is that in the UK you can request any photos of you taken on the vast closed circuit television, that is ubiquitous across the UK landscape. You can submit a request for a time, day and location and request any photo or video footage taken of you. Its kind of like a visual FOIA request for the surveillance layer of our society. This concept intrigued me, and I wanted to explore in relationship to other layers of convergence between the API economy and our increasingly digital society. Imagine if there was FOIA process for data. I could submit a request to a single organization that would then make requests to leading technology, and big data companies, asking them for a copy of all data they possess about me, and disclose any partners that they have shared this data with. I know portions of this exist from companies like Acxiom, but I would like to see a more coherent, intra-company solution that could better serve individuals who wish to understand how companies are using their data. A concept like FOIA for data across any company will not please corporate america, especially in a landscape where exploitation of users data is the predominant business model. However we are in the early years of the Internet, and things are very much the wild wild west, and it is...[<a href="/2014/06/04/retrieve-my-data-like-retrieving-video-surveillance-photos-from-cctv/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I've been tracking on the API from the US Census Bureau since they launched in 2012, and even met with them to discuss their strategy over the last couple years. The team at the Census Bureau has slowly integrated an external API into their operations, opening up conversations around census survey data, that is harder to achieve from just downloads only.
I recently saw a post that Census Bureau is gearing up for the 2020 census. As I was reading the post, I couldn't help but think about how the Census API will influence how the 2020 census is executed. Additionally I wonder if any other APIs will be used during the census process, such as Twitter or other social platforms.
In my opinion, the census, and its resulting data will continue to be a cornerstone of the API and open data space. Census data adds a lot of value to other websites, mobile apps, and data visualizations and analysis, and is critical in providing context for both our online and offline worlds. I will continue to keep an eye on the US Census API, and look for signs of how APIs are influencing the 2020 census.

			<p><em>04 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>I am really impressed with the quality of API deployments coming out of the federal government recently. I wrote about the FBOpen API from 18F a couple months ago, and the latest is the OpenFDA API from the Food &amp; Drug Administration. I&rsquo;ve been watching the rollout of the API from behind the scenes for a while now, but with all my travel and speaking I haven't had time to write about or participate, but now that they've officially launch publicly, I wanted to help showcase what they've been up to at the FDA. Meaningful First Impression When you first land on OpenFDA, you immediately understand what it does, thanks to the interactive visual on the homepage introducing OpenFDA, letting you know that it contains more than 3 million adverse drug event reports, with frequently reported indications for drug use among women, 55 to 90. This simple simple description, combined with an interactive visual that demonstrates the value contained within this government API resource, leaves a meaningful first impression upon arrival. Not Just Talk Of Being Open We&rsquo;ve misused the word open when it comes to APIs, so that I&rsquo;m always skeptical when I see it use, but not in the case of OpenFDA. At the top of the home page, it gives three distinct examples of how OpenFDA embraces open, with data, code, and in community, and through making the API openly accessible, simply by requesting a key, in exchange for your email address. Explaining What It Is All About OpenFDA explains what the OpenFDA is all about with a detailed about page, telling what the API does, who worked on the project, and how you can get involved. This type of background is often overlooked by API providers, requiring API consumers to have to piece together what the big picture is around an API&mdash;not with OpenFDA. On-boarding with the API starts with an overview of the project, and resulting API, then dropping you...[<a href="/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I finished up my response to the Department of Education RFI focused around the use of APIs at the government agency, a place where I&rsquo;m not just advocating for APIs, but pushing very hard for read / write APIs. I finished up my response to the RFI while waiting for my flight out of Barcelona where I spoke at API Days Mediterranea, where I the heard echoes of the importance role that write APIs will play in government, during a talk from Xavier Badosa (@badosa). All of this primed the pump for me thinking about write APIs in government, while on my flight back to Los Angeles. This will be one of the biggest challenges API evangelists in government will face in coming years, something that scares the shit out of government leaders and their legal advisors, but will also be essential to government assuming its role in the API economy. A read and write strategy for some government APIs, will evolve government resources from being just a download, to being a conversation with private sector interests that are putting those resources to use. As I highlighted in my Department of Education RFI response, allowing reading and writing to government resources, combined with development of sensible service composition around these resources, and establishment of trusted access tiers, will be the connector between the public and private sector, in the API economy. I&rsquo;m not API delusional enough to believe that deploying of APIs, or even read / write APIs will automatically be a good thing in all scenarios. However the opportunity to increase access to government resources by the private sector, in a secure and controlled way, should be considered by all government agencies. When appropriate, the design and deployment of read / write APIs is bundled with all the essential building blocks for API management, it has the potential to allow for a new, real-time, two way partnership to emerge between the public and private...[<a href="/2014/06/03/significance-of-the-we-the-people-api-being-first-modern-read-write-web-api-in-government/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>03 Jun 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m working my way through the collection of talks from API Strategy &amp; Practice Amsterdam that are available on Youtube, and I'm reminded of what an amazing lineup of speakers we've managed to assemble at not just #APIStrat Amsterdam, but also in San Francisco and New York. Today I re-watched three videos which I think reflect not just #APIStrat, but also where we are at in the industry: Mike Amundsen - In an effort to understand where we are going with the API economy , Mike looks back at the history of computing, trying to understand how we got here, uncovering some interesting patterns, while weaving it all together into a compelling story worthy of a Ken Burns PBS documentary. Romain Huet - When selecting talks for #APIStrat we don't just select big brands, we look for the most compelling speakers, and the #APIStrat audience got both with a walk through the Twittersphere and bonus look at the convergence of Internet of Things and APIs, by taking an audience selfie, and flying a drone on stage, from Romain Huett of Twitter. Eva Sjokvist - Eva from Absolut Vodka wowed the #APIStrat audience with the story of their cocktail database API, which went beyond tech, and internally changed culture at the leading vodka manufacturer, teaching them how to look outside the company walls and realize the benefits of external partnerships. I&rsquo;m still working my way through other talks, but these three stand out as examples of what we look for from presenters at #APIStrat. Our speakers tell stories, wow the audience with entertaining demonstrations of the power of APIs, while showcasing how APIs have made an impact at companies, and within industries around the globe. If you have an idea for a talk that you would like to share at #APIStrat in Chicago, something that you think will not just benefit the 700+ attendees, but will also push the API space forward, we want to hear...[<a href="/2014/06/03/pushing-the-space-forward-with-talks-at-apistrat-did-you-submit-yours-for-chicago/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I spent considerable time going through the Department of Education RFI, answering each question in as much detail as I possibly could. You can find my full response below. In the end I felt I could provide more value by summarizing my response, eliminating much of the redundancy across different sections of the RFI, and just cut through the bureaucracy as I (and APIs) prefer to do. Open Data By Default All publicly available data at the Department of Education needs to be open by default. This is not just a mandate, this is a way of life. There is no data that is available on any Department of Education websites that should not be available for data download. Open data downloads are not separate from existing website efforts at Department of Education, they are the other side of the coin, making the same content and data available in machine readable formats, rather than available via HTML&mdash;allowing valuable resources to be used in systems and applications outside of the department&rsquo;s control. Open API When There Are Resources The answer to whether or not the Department of Education should provide APIs is the same as whether or not the agency should deploy websites&mdash;YES! Not all individuals and companies will have the resources to download, process, and put downloadable resources to use. In these situations APIs can provide much easier access to open data resources, and when open data resources are exposed as APIs it opens up access to a much wider audience, even non-developers. Lightweight, simple, API access to open data inventory should be default along with data downloads when resources are available. This approach to APIs by default, will act as the training ground for not just 3rd party developers, but also internally, allowing Department of Education staff to learn how to manage APIs in a safe, read-only environment. Using A Modern API Design, Deployment, and Management Approach As the usage of the Internet matured...[<a href="/2014/06/02/my-response-to-how-can-the-department-of-education-increase-innovation-transparency-and-access-to-data/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2014/05/29/the-swagger-specification/">The Swagger Specification</a></h3>
			<p><em>29 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>This post is an exact copy from the Swagger specification page, on the Swagger Github project. As I was reviewing the latest Swagger 2.0 release, I read this descripton, and I really felt it caputred not ust the mission of Swagger, but spoke to the essence of API design. With this in mind I wanted to re-post, as part of my ongoing coverage of the API design space.&nbsp; The goal of Swagger&trade; is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swager removes the guesswork in calling the service. Use cases for machine-readable API interfaces include interactive documentation, code generation for documentation, client, and server, as well as automated test cases. Swagger-enabled APIs expose JSON files that correctly ahere to the Swagger Specification, documented in this repository. These files can either be produced and served statically, or be generated dynamically from your application. Without going into a long history of interfaces to Web Services, this is not the first attempt to do so. We can learn from CORBA, WSDL and WADL. These specifications had good intentions but were limited by proprietary vendor-specific implementations, being bound to a specific programming language, and goals which were too open-ended. In the end, they failed to gain traction. Swagger does not require you to rewrite your existing API. It does not require binding any software to a service--the service being described may not even be yours. It does, however, require the capabilities of the service be described in the structure of the Swagger Specification. Not all services can be described by Swagger--this specification is not intended to cover every possible use-case...[<a href="/2014/05/29/the-swagger-specification/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m constantly evangelizing how APIs bring individuals and companyies out of their silos and stimulate conversations internally amongst distributed groups,co and externally with partners and the public. During a federal government panel this Monday in Maryland, I was facilitating a discussion between NASA, GSA, the White House, with participation from Energy, FEMA and other agencies. It was mentioned several times that APIs were facilitating conversation beyond what just a data download does, in a way that changed culture, making APIs more about people than technology&mdash;something that is core to my mission as the API Evangelist. A well crafted API, with essential building blocks like interactive documentation, blogs, forums, active social media accounts, create valuable feedback loops that stimulate conversation around valuable API resources, and the applications and sites that put them use. Then later this week, at Gluecon in Colorado, I saw a talk from Rebecca Standig (@understandig), linguist and software engineer at Keen.io, that blew my mind, taking the concept of APIs and communication to a whole new level. Rebecca connected the dots between linguistics, the need for linguists to have programming skills, and the potential when they design APIs. I&rsquo;m still processing everything she said, and told her I&rsquo;d like to work together more to tell stories about lingistics and APIs, so there will be more stories on this subject, but I had to share my initial thoughts while I was processing my Evernote from the talk. I&rsquo;m always working to craft meaningful stories in the API space, that will help people understand the potential of APIs. Throughout my evangelism I&rsquo;m encouraging companies, organizations and government agencies to employ APIs that will help stimulate conversation with employees, partners and the public. What Rebecca is proposing takes this to a whole new level for me, and opening up new possibilities for how we configure applications to communicate, in a way that is rooted in, and derived from our own understanding of how humans communicate....[<a href="/2014/05/23/why-apis-should-be-designed-by-linguists/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>One of the interesting conversations that came out of the APIStrat Un-Workshops at Gluecon this week, was the exploration of the analogy of applying copyright to restaurant menus, and applying copyright to APIs. This type of conversations is why 3Scale and API Evangelist support these types of events. When you Google the topic of restaurant menu API copyright, you get a wealth of contradictory answers that show the difficulty of applying copyright to menus. In practice you can put a copyright on your menu, and you could probably spend a lot of energy enforcing this if someone copies your menu. In reality, it will probably be pretty hard to win, unless your menu is exactly copied, and a fair use claim couldn&rsquo;t be enforced. One interesting layer in this discussion, is the ubiquity of restaurant menus, and even the order, naming and organization of these menus. A phase I don&rsquo;t think APIs have reached, but will at some point. It is pretty difficult to argue that menus are essential to interoperability, meaning you can sit down at any restaurant and the menu contributes to you on boarding with the restaurant experience. Imagine if you had to know to ask for food via a chalkboard, or pick up some phone to call in what you wanted, without knowing any orderly way of understanding what a restaurant provided? Each restaurant would be different, and screw up the whole thing. I would argue that bookmarks, images, video and other common API designs are just like hamburgers, steaks, and salads, when I explore this analogy. I think a lot of the confusion in the API copyright discussion is around the separation between an API and the API definition. The order and layout of restaurant menu is not the restaurant, just like the API design is not the API. Could you imagine enforcing copyright on a american restaurant or diner menu layout? Maybe with fast food, which is not about...[<a href="/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>
When I run into enterprise folks at events, one of the common characteristics I notice, is they always tell me how much they read my blog. Yay! Many of these people have Twitter accounts, which follow me and I follow them, and they can usually reference specific topics or posts I've written&mdash;demonstrating they do indeed read.
Most of these people I'm aware of online, and I usually consider them fence sitters. They rarely retweet posts, or engage in conversations online, they just consume. I think this is fine, because not all everyone is suited for actively engaging in the social media world. What I do think is interesting is how interested they are in my work, and they let me know how my work reaches them, and reference specific topics and stories, but don&rsquo;t actually contribute to the conversation.
In my opinion this isn't individuals faults, this is enterprise culture. Businesses of this scale are not equipped to deliver value unless it is sanctioned and specifically part of the larger brand. The enterprise generates value, but only when in service of their business objectives. Generating open value for a community, even as small as a retweet, comment, or a response in blog post, is not in the DNA.
I strongly believe that businesses should generate just as much value as they consume. I&rsquo;m not stupid. I understand that capitalism is about extracting value and monetizing for shareholders, but can&rsquo;t help but think about what this existence is like for these individuals.
Personally, I find it very rewarding to contributing to communities, and the overall health of the API community, by contributing ideas, engaging in conversations, without the expectation that it will all result in revenue for API Evangelist. Ultimately all of this effort comes back to me, and ensures I will be able to sustain my evangelism efforts, while also nourishing my own individual needs.

			<p><em>23 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m still gathering my thoughts from the deep technical conversations that occurred on Tuesday at the Gluecon APIStrat Un-Workshops&nbsp;in Colorado. Before the official Gluecon festivities kicked off, 3Scale and API Evangelist held a 5 hour un-workshop where approximately 70 API professionals gathered to discuss some of the most pressing topics in the API space. Internet of Things One of the fastest growing areas of the API design and deployment, is in support of the Internet of things (IoT). During the IoT portion we had some interesting conversation around how APIs enable communication in Iot world, including some heated discussion about whether or not HTTP will scale and handle the fast growing Iot space. API Versioning One of the hot topics proposed within the API design un-workshop was API versioning, which I thought would be a technical dive into versioning, but ended up being more of the human side of versioning, and communicating with your API consumers&mdash;clearly setting expectations around the how and why of API versioning. Real-Time Dovetailing nicely with the Iot discussion, there was a very enlightening discussion around real-time, which covered one of the most fundamental issues of real-time&mdash;what is it? As with the API versioning discussion, the conversation took gave a nod to the human side of tech, acknowledging real-time was more about expectations of end-users and providers, than about technology. API Copyright As expected the topic of API copyright was a major part of the discussion, not just at the APIStart Un-workshops, but also the wider Gluecon. A group of us walked through the legal case, where everything stands with API Commons, and how we can best take the offensive attack on the issue as a community, which includes educating more API providers, consumers and business owners. API Design &amp; Discovery Emphasizing the importance of the release of APIs.json and APIs.io, and the conversations around API Commons, a portion of the API design workshop walked through the available API definition formats,...[<a href="/2014/05/23/keeping-the-api-conversation-moving-forward-at-the-gluecon-apistrat-unworkshops/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>In 2014 API design is exploding, proving to be one of the fastest growing areas of the API industry. For many years we&rsquo;ve talked purely about API management, but after consolidation in the space, and serious growth, the conversation has shifted. The API conversation is moving upstream in the API lifecycle, focusing on designing, mocking, and collaborating around designing the best quality APIs possible, that will meet the needs of consumers--before any code is written and deployed. A new wave of API design companies have zeroed in on supporting healthy API design practices by providing tools like Apiary.io which allow you to mock, design and collaborate early on in API design process. This new wave of tools and service is meant to foster the healthiest possible design practices, and is cultivating an expanding army of knowledgeable API designers, who demonstrate that API design can be more art than science and technology. Amid this rapid expansion we are witnessing the potentially damaging effects of the Oracle v Google legal battle, which is looking to inject unnecessary concerns around copyright into this blossoming API design sector. What will the copyright of APIs do to the API design process? Will API design be as creative when you have to be concerned with designing unique interfaces vs creating with the best of breed API design patterns that are already available in the space? Will you design for quality of interfaces, the needs of your consumers and interoperability, the lifeblood of APIs, when you are focused on copyright and your API definitions become about legal protection and not access and innovation as they were intended? If the precedent is set that copyright indeed applies to web APIs, I think that one of the chilling waves that will ripple through the industry will be extremely visible in the API design layer. API definitions are not one of the layers where control and monetization should be applied, allowing for more creative energy...[<a href="/2014/05/23/api-design-may-take-on-new-meaning-when-api-copyright-comes-into-the-picture/">Read More</a>]</p>

API discovery has not changed much since 2005, when John Musser launched ProgrammableWeb, the API directory we've all come to know and love. In 2014 (9 years later), we have Mashape and a handful of other API directory and discovery tools, but we have not made progress on truly being able to discover the best APIs possible, in a distributed, machine-readable way.
Steve Willmott of 3Scale, and Kin Lane of API Evangelist, are at it again, looking to provide a possible solution, that we are calling APIs.json&mdash;a machine readable listing of your APIs and supporting building blocks that lives in the root of your domain.
The objective of APIs.json is to help fix this problem by making it easy for people to signpost where the APIs on a given domain are and provide information on how they work. The format is simple and extensible and can be put into any web root domain for discovery.
We are just getting started, so make sure and get involved via the Github repository or via the Google Group we've setup to facilitate discussion.

			<p><em>16 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m torn on a matter that I face when reviewing APIs for companies. I get emails from people who want me to review their API implementation, and they state they want public developers to get excited about an API, but the program isn't fully available out in the open. Most often these APIs just have some sort of landing page, which is really just a press release, and email address of someone to contact to gain access. I&rsquo;m all for people being able to have any grade of privacy for their APIs ranging from internal to completely public, but I just it difficult when API providers express interest in public developers learning about and potentially using an API, but don't provide any of the common building blocks developers are used to with a modern API. In my mind, if you are courting public developers, you should provide as much information as you possibly can, and manage access at the registration and API access levels. In the end I guess I'm just exploring the best way to educate companies about the benefits of opening up, provide more information about their developer program, helping them understand that this how it is done with modern web APIs. With the right on-boarding, and API management strategy you can control who actually gets access to your API, and I can't think of why you would want to hide documentation, forums, code libraries, app showcases and other things for an API that is generally available to the public. In 2014, if you are going to provide API resources to the public, you should expose as much of the developers area and as man of the supporting building block to the public as you can. At least talk through each one, and discuss the pros and cons of this being public.

			<p><em>15 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>
As I&rsquo;m working to add yet another API example to my growing list of hypermedia APIs in the wild, I can't help but think about the long evolution of hypermedia, and how it will eventually become part of the mainstream API consciousness.
I first started following the often heated discussions around hypermedia a couple years ago as leading API technologists began discussing this significant evolution in API design. Hypermedia has numerous benefits and features, but one you often hear in discussions is that if we use hypermedia we can stop designing custom clients that consume APIs.
The logic is that if every API call comes bundled with URLs for discovering and navigating the resources that are made available via an API, clients can just use this as a blueprint for any app to API interactions. This became a fairly large argument between hypermedia architects and hypermedia haters, something that I think turned a lot of people off to the concept, forcing us to stick with many of the bad habits we already knew.
As I review these new hypermedia APIs, few of them are perfect by any hypermedia measurement, but they use the sensible portions of hypermedia discovery and navigation to deliver a better API experience for developers. I don't think API providers are doing it because of the perfect hypermedia vision we've heard articulated in the past, they are borrowing the pieces that make sense to them and that meet their goals.
Someday we may achieve a world where API clients aren't custom, with every application automatically knowing how to discover, interact, and navigate any API resource it will need. However I think in the currently reality, we will see hypermedia being adopted because it just makes sense as a next step for sensible API design, and this is how we should communicate it to curious API designers, looking to understand exactly what is this concept called hypermedia.

			<p><em>15 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>We&rsquo;ve seen a significant growth in the number of APIs in government, but to date most of these APIs are read-only, meaning you can just retrieve content or data from these APIs, not actually add, update or delete any of the resources made available via these APis. I've written about the lack of write APIs in government before, trying to kickstart the conversation amongst existing API advocates at various agencies, and now 18F, the elite tech group at the GSA is doing the same. 18F has a page dedicated to the conversation around write APIs in government, with eight active examples of write APIs, nine potential examples, and two that are "under consideration". What 18F is doing, is a key part of the process that will demonstrate to existing API owners at government agencies, that write APIs are possible, by showcasing the existing implementations, as well as others that are under development. Agencies need clear examples to follow, reassuring them that this is possible in government, giving them potential mentors, and in some cases incentivize agencies by making them feel they are behind the curve, and missing out on opportunities to lead when serving their constituents. The importance thate government agencies have read / write APIs goes beyond the obvious benefits around content and data being more complete and up to date--a two way street, when it comes to API operations requires a more dedicated approach, bringing agencies closer to both private and public sector partners who will be consuming and contributing to the API(s). This process reduces the chance an API will be launched and forgotten about, which really does nobody any good, and contributes to giving APIs in government a bad name. If you work at a federal agency, or are a contractor working on APIs within government, make sure and reach out to 18F and see how you can be part of this significant change in how federal government operates.

			<p><em>14 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>
API interoperability and reciprocity provider Zapier is looking to get everyone up to speed on the world of APIs, by providing an introduction to APIs that is meant for both developers who are new to APIs, and easy enough for non-developers to follow.
To help get people up to speed on APIs, Zapier&rsquo;s introduction has eight chapters covering the big picture:


Chapter 1: Introduction
Chapter 2: Protocols
Chapter 3: Data Formats
Chapter 4: Authentication, Part 1
Chapter 5: Authentication, Part 2
Chapter 6: API Design
Chapter 7: Real-Time Communication
Chapter 8: Implementation

It is good to see providers like Zapier develop an introductory course for people to learn about APIs. It is in Zapier&rsquo;s interest to help get people up to speed&mdash;the more folks who understand that APIs exist, the more chance they will use Zapier as the platform they depend on to orchestrate their lives in the cloud.
Zapier&rsquo;s move reflects my original vision behind API Evangelist, and my belief that everyone should understand APIs, and I mean everyone! Much like personal finance, not everyone needs to understand the inner workings of APIs, but every individual should understand they exist, and how they can use services like Zapier to take control of our digital self.

			<p><em>14 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>A couple of weeks ago I attended a two day API specification session between major California utilities, Southern California Edison (SCE), San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (SDG&amp;E), and Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E), that was organized by Hypertek Inc. for National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), that is looking to push forward the Green Button data and API agenda of the White House and Department of Energy. The Green Button API and open data model already exists, but the current hurdle for the initiative is to get leading utilities to agree to specific implementation definitions that serve their customers, so it can be ratified as a standard. This entire two day session was dedicated to walking through line by line, and establish the oAuth scope that each of the three utility companies would implementing when providing Green Button data via the API to 3rd party developers, who are building solutions for utility customers. An example of this in the wild, would be if a utility customer wanted to get a quote for a rooftop solar installation, the installer could use a software solution that was developed by a 3rd party vendor, that pulls that customers energy usage via the Green Button API, and generate a precise quote for the number of solar panels they&rsquo;d need to cover their energy usage. Now this is just one example of how energy data could be used, but a very powerful and relevant one in 2014, that give customers access and control over their data. Before we even get there, the Green Button API definition, data model, and oAuth scope has to be finalized with utility providers, before it can be submitted as a standard&mdash;with the final oAuth scope being what will be agreed to by each 3rd party developer that integrates with each utility's Green Button API. This oAuth scope sets the tone for the conversation that 3rd party software providers, and vendors can ultimately have with...[<a href="/2014/05/14/the-future-of-public-private-sector-partnerships-being-negotiated-at-the-api-oauth-scope-level/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>14 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>There is a laundry list of problems with the current state of terms of service, affectionality called TOS--those legal documents we all agree to as part of our usage of online services, and are defining relationships between API providers and their consumers. API Voice is dedicated to exploring this, and other building blocks that make up the politics of APIs, an area you will see increased coverage of in 2014. As I continue to develop a better understanding of how API terms of service influence the API economy, I can't help but think one of the fundamental flaws of API terms of use is that there is no room for negotiation. Earlier this month I explored the concept of being able to pay for alternate options within a terms of service, as part of my ongoing journey towards a machine readable TOS. I strongly believe that to fully realize the API economy as many of us technologists see it, the terms of service have to be machine readable, allowing for seamless integration into the other political building blocks like privacy policies, service level agreements, partner access tiers, and pricing. If you think about it, current API terms of service reflect the command and control governance style of SOA, not the flexible, agile and innovative approach that APIs are often known for. Why aren't API terms of service negotiable? Well they are, it just isn't built into the existing API platform. Many API ecosystem allow for circumventing and negotiating at the terms of service level behind closed doors, with partners, and API consumers who share the same investors, it just isn't a conversation that occurs out in the open. This approach reflects legacy ways of doing business, where if you are in the know, have the right connections, you can negotiate, and not the new API driven approach that will allow the API economy to scale as required. The ability for API consumers to negotiate the...[<a href="/2014/05/14/one-of-the-problems-with-api-terms-of-service-is-that-there-is-no-negotiation/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>14 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>The time has come for one of my favorite events in the tech space&mdash;Gluecon. If you have never been to Gluecon or Defrag, read some of my previous posts about just how different the event is. Gluecon has brought together tech leaders, who have helped define the API space for the last six years, to a small resort in Colorado, creating an environment for conversation I have not experienced anywhere else. This year Gluecon is exceptionally special for me, because 3Scale and API Evangelist are doing a special first day of un-workshop discussions on API design and the Internet of Things and Realtime, continuing the API Strategy &amp; Practice conversation. You can find all the details over at the APIStrat site, and even register and be part of the conversation. The topic of API design has dominated my blog traffic, with every story I do on the subject filling the top 10 most visited posts for the last 3 months. The conversation of how to design APIs has exploded, with the introduction of languages and tooling from Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML, and as we realize that API design is more art than science&mdash;something that developers and business leaders should all be part of. The first Gluecon / APIStrat un-workshop is dedicated to this fast growing area of the API sector. In 2014 you can&rsquo;t have a conversation about APIs without discussing the next wave of Internet enabled devices&mdash;dubbed Internet of Things (Iot). We are seeing a new breed of APIs, and frameworks emerge that don&rsquo;t just connect devices to the Internet, but also facilitate realtime communications between devices and the cloud&mdash;merging realtime and Iot. The second Gluecon / APIStrat un-workshop is bringing together a wide range of practitioners to discuss what is next for APIs in the context of realtime IoT. It isn&rsquo;t too late to get your tickets to Gluecon and register for the APIStrat un-workshops. Tickets to Denver are pretty inexpensive from...[<a href="/2014/05/14/join-me-for-iot-realtime-and-api-design-at-gluecon-in-colorado-next-week/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>14 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>I was invited to moderate a workshop panel in Maryland next week at the The American Council for Technology (ACT) - Industry Advisory Council (IAC) Management of Change 2014 event. If you arenat familiar with ACT-IAC, they are a non-profit, public-private partnership dedicated to improving government through the application of information technology--with the event bringing government leaders together, and discussing open data, open source, and APIs. The workshop is described as: Open Data isn&rsquo;t just data sets. It&rsquo;s APIs, it&rsquo;s open source and, most importantly &mdash; it&rsquo;s people. Working within these new concepts and methods requires a change in culture by our programs, executives, and contracting offices. In order to execute on providing open source to the public, we need new skills for the workforce that let us contract appropriately, and learn how to design our systems from the ground up with APIs and open source in mind. I will be leading the discussion between a panel of X subject matter experts: Kevin Youel-Page - Assistant Commissioner, Integrated Award Environment, General Services Administration Dan Gahafer - Forge.mil Program Manager, Defense Information Systems Agency Leigh Heyman - Director of New Media Technologies, the White House Dan Lockney &ndash; Technology Transfer Program Executive, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Pamela Wise-Martinez - Senior Strategic Enterprise Architect, Office of the Director of National Intelligence I&rsquo;m honored to have been invited to help lead the discussion, which is in alignment with my mission to bring awareness of the power of APIs amongst government leaders. I&rsquo;m looking forward to what I, and the rest of the event, can learn from these government leaders regarding how they are using open data, open source software, and APIs to effect change within their agencies. The fact that we are having conversations like this at the highest levels of government in 2014, after four years of API evangelism, makes me hopeful that we are making progress, in not just changing how we do business,...[<a href="/2014/05/14/i-will-be-moderating-open-data-and-api-workshop-discussion-with-gsa-disa-dni-nasa-and-white-house-next-week-in-maryland/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>12 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>I had too many scribbles in my Evernote about work I&rsquo;m doing for APIs in higher education, so I decided I need to publish as a story, which hopefully will help me organize my thoughts, figure out my next moves, and share what I&rsquo;m doing to a couple of folks who asked what I&rsquo;m up to in this area. APIs In Higher Education Institutions To keep API Evangelist operating I have some very supportive partners who invest in my research, and one of the areas 3Scale&nbsp;and I work together on is understanding how APIs are currently being used in higher education. As part of my recent research I went back through the universities I track on who have APIs, to see whats changed, and I stumbled upon the fact that BYU&rsquo;s API inventory has grown to a mind blowing 261 APIs, covering almost all aspects of university operations. I will be continuing this research on what BYU is up to, but also the 10 other institutions I&rsquo;m tracking on, and as I do with other areas of the API space, try to identify some of the common building blocks universities are employing&mdash;hoping to create a blueprint that other institutions can follow. You can find all this research, kindly supported by 3Scale, up on the Github repository designated for the project. Dept of Education and FAFSA APIBeyond the general use of APIs by universities, last November I started working on a prototype of an API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid or FAFSA form, looking to jump start a conversation at the Department of Education around APIs. It worked, and in January they announced that they would looking to get feedback on what an API for FAFSA would look like. Behind the scenes I was contacted to provide a proposal for a FAFSA API, hoping to chase after some budget that could fund such a project.

			<p><em>10 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>I wanted to comment on the response yesterday in the Oracle v. Google case being played out in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. This appeal is important to me because it will not just set the tone for how APIs are designed, deployed and managed, but also because I worked with the EFF to craft the Amicus Brief, and signed on as one of the computer scientists in opposition of API copyright--making the response a huge blow to me personally. The case is far from settled, so I will refrain from using hyperbole when I describe the situation, but will echo the EFF&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;the implications of this decision are significant, and dangerous&rdquo;. For me, it doesn&rsquo;t change the conversation, it just re-enforces what I already believe, and hopefully it will do the same amongst API providers across the space. Steve Willmott of 3Scale and I read the writing on the wall when we started API Commons last year, that a political line was being drawn by the Oracle v Google appeal, and would not just continue to play out in the courts, but also within the heart of the API economy, and that we needed to collectively stand up and push back--API Commons is a back-burn strategy for the wildfire that Oracle has set. API Commons basically declares that API definitions are ultimately copyrightable or licensable as code, depending on your viewpoint, all you do is hang your definition in the API Commons, and provide a reference to the license that matters to you, whether it licensed as content (CC) or software (FSF)&nbsp;is your call. Giving every API provider a torch, and the ability to participate in setting the back-burn, taking a stance in the Oracle v Google wildfire that has been set by Oracle, that could potentially burn down all of our collective resources. In my opinion, Oracle v Google is just one of many battles that...[<a href="/2014/05/10/where-will-your-api-stand-in-the-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-debate/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>I just turned down a potential partnership with a major enterprise company. As I do with many stories, I will scrub the names of those involved, because there is no reason to blame a single company, this is a lesson any large entity can learn from&mdash;for this story, we&rsquo;ll just call them Acme Inc. Acme Inc. contacted me a couple weeks ago, stating they were looking to do some research into the API space, and have been following my work for some time. After a few emails we made time to get on the phone and talk about what each of us were up to. We spent about an hour, where I gave my history, why I do API Evangelist, and how I go about generating short form, and long form content as part of my research across the API space. Acme Inc. shared their interest in exploring how APIs could be applied to a couple of business sectors, and were looking to generate white paper(s) that they could distribute internally, and amongst partners. Acme was extremely vague on details, and I understand that not everyone can be as open as me, especially when you work at a big company. We ended the call, agreeing that we&rsquo;d explore what a potential partnership might look like, around research projects, but they would need me to sign an NDA first&mdash;no problem. I received an NDA via email a couple days later, as I was on my way to IBM Impact in Las Vegas, and while I was busy in Las Vegas I received an a reminder to please sign the agreement. When I was done in Las Vegas, on my way to Texas for another engagement, I signed the NDA, printed a PDF and sent it back. A few days later, as I was leaving Texas, on my way home to LA for about 8 hours, before I left to Berlin, I received another email requesting that...[<a href="/2014/05/07/partnering-for-me-is-about-sharing-of-ideas-research-and-stories/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>One of the most meaningful API projects I work on with the US government is the Green Button API, which provides access to energy data for US consumers across the country. First, what is the Green Button API? The Green Button builds on top of the Green Button data initiative which is: ...an industry-led effort that responds to a White House call-to-action: provide electricity customers with easy access to their energy usage data in a consumer-friendly and computer-friendly format via a "Green Button" on electric utilities' website. Which Todd Park, Assistant to the President and U.S. Chief Technology Officer states: Giving residential and commercial customers secure access to their own energy data in a standard, easy-to-understand format will help them visualize their energy use and identify opportunities to save money. At the same time, Green Button is spurring the development of new online tools and services that add value to this information, creating an innovative new domain for entrepreneurship and job creation. The Green Button API delivers flexible access to Energy Usage Information through a set of RESTful interfaces, providing access any consumers Green Button data. The Green Button API is being designed by EnergyOS, providing a solution that any utility can download and run to mediate access between their retail energy customers, and 3rd parties who will provide energy data driven services to them. I&rsquo;m very excited to announce that the Green Button API definition has been added to the API Commons. The Green Button API represents why 3Scale and API Evangelist launched API Commons, to provide a place where we can hang the most important, and meaningful API interfaces, and underlying data models, to encourage re-use. You can find the Swagger specification for the Green Button API on Github, complete with interactive documentation and other resources. The project is a work in progress, with the final specification still being hammered out by EnergyOS and utilities across the country, but the API is fully...[<a href="/2014/05/07/green-button-energy-api-added-to-api-commons/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>I heard an interesting statement this week at APIDays Berlin that I&rsquo;ve heard before, "API document is an bug not a feature". The logic behind this is that if you design a proper API, using proven REST and hypermedia patterns, you shouldn&rsquo;t need documentation. While this is true, and I agree with 100%, it ignores the vital process of getting the average person up to speed--simply stating that what many of us are actively doing, and what we currently know is a bug. I work with any folks who barely know what an API is, or what JSON is, yet have a lot of influence and control over whether some very important APIs exist, or not! I know that these API experts are speaking to the correct path that we should be taking, yet there is very little consideration to understanding where most folks are on the path, and how many forks there are in the road, before we get to where we need to be. To help those understand the path, think of the numerous APIs in the past with no documentation, then all of a sudden static API documentation was the norm, and now in 2014, interactive documentation has become commonplace. Alongside this journey the debate around REST, and recently hypermedia has been going on, with only recently getting to a place where healthy patterns are being used across many APIs, not just a handful of demos. Understanding this will help you see the path that we are on. A path that we can only move down at a certain speed, because it takes careful education and planning to move not just developers, but business leaders down. Maybe eventually the path will be a highway, and at some point a freeway that we can get more people down, but for now it takes a lot of planning to shepherding to move everyone along.

			<p>This is my speaker notes from my talk this week at APIDays Global in Berlin. You can find my slide deck in my talks repository on Github, and find more photos from the event on Flickr. We live in a very exciting time, one where the resources we need to build meaningful websites and applications, that have the opportunity to impact how we do business, and potentially make change in how the world around us, is rapidly expanding. Once upon a time, many of these digital resources took millions of dollars of investment to deliver, if they were available at all. Now, with the introduction of web APIs, many valuable resources are available in a self-service, pay as you go manner, allowing anyone to integrate these valuable resources their own business or personal worlds. History of APIs Over the last 14 years of the Internet, companies have been using a new approach to APIs, built on the same technology that drives the web&mdash;HTTP. Web APIs are not a new, proprietary way of building applications on the Internet, but a way of delivering the vital resources web and mobile applications need, side by side with the same websites that humans consume&mdash;except APIs are raw data, minus the visuals that a human would require, enabling developers to deliver exactly the experience that end users will need. Delivering On Original Visions of Digital Commerce This low cost approach to deliver resources on the web has been pioneered by tech giants like SalesForce in delivering the next generation of customer relationship management, and sales in the clouds. We&rsquo;ve also seen web APIs transform world of ecommerce from tech giants like Amazon, and shift auctions online from eBay. The payments needed to transact in this new world of commerce also emerged via APIs from Paypal, and a newer generation of payment API providers like Stripe.

			<p><em>01 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>
Terms of service guide every aspect of how we provide and consume an APIs&nbsp;that drive&nbsp;our web and mobile applications. As an excercise, lets imagine a future where API terms of service (TOS) are machine readable, and always in alignment with the multiple partner tiers, and the service composition of an API platform.
Right now, the options available to API consumers is organized into service packages, allowing us multiple tiers of access, based upon usage + cost, when registering for and consuming API resources. Imagine if during this process the API TOS were integrated into the registration and account management workflows. Imagine you could fully understand each portion of the API TOS, and be provided with options, instead of a single, rigid level of service.
Currently options for API access are throttled across TOS, privacy policy, branding, service level agreements, pricing, and service composition and partner access tiers. I want to explore the possibility that these building blocks could be machine readable, allowing for variances on each aspect of API operations. This scenario would allow for API consumers to prioritize which aspects of operations are most important to them, allowing them to pay more for premium access to API services.
I&rsquo;m just working through my thoughts on the politics of APIs, expanding on ideas of machine readable terms of service (TOS) introduce to me by Tyler Singletary (@harmophone)&nbsp;of @KloutAPI, and also a tweet from Antony Falco (@antonyfalco)&nbsp;of Orchestrate.io&nbsp;about the potential to allow for variances of TOS.
I would love to hear your thoughts on this subject. Am I off in left field, or is this something we should play with more?

I getting ready to heading to Berlin in the morning. I'm scheduled to speak at APIDays Berlin on Monday. APIDays is the sister site to #APIStrat, an event you will always find me at, no matter where it is at in the world.
APIDays has been pushing the conversation around APIs across Europe and the United States for a couple years now. While #APIStrat is focused on larger markets, and bigger events&mdash;APIDays is focused on new markets, and conversations within new business verticals, like the automobile API conversation, in San Francisco this June.
I&rsquo;m scheduled for the end of the day Monday, so my talk titled &ldquo;The Kin Lane Show&rdquo;, will be a summary of the current state of API space, while also integrating the other talks I will see throughout the day. Something that will helps me fine tune a talk for a local audience and specifically for APIDays Berlin.
Hopefully you already have your tickets, if not you can catch me at the end of May at APIDays Mediterranea in Barcelona, and at APIDays San Francisco in June.

			<p><em>01 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>Its official, the next edition of API Strategy will be in Chicago, September 24,25, and 26th 2014. We've dubbed this version of the conference, 'APIs Going Mainstream'! As APIs make their way into almost every business sector imaginable, we thought it would make sense to have an API conversation with some of the top brands, in the heartland of the United States--Chicago. We are kicking things off with six speakers: Ashe Dryden Ashe is an outspoken educator for diversity, inclusiveness, and empathy. She's currently writing a book on increasing diversity within companies, as well as working on a video series and site to serve as a resource to people who want to get involved.&nbsp; John Ellis As Global Technologist and Head of the Ford Developer Program with Ford Motor Company, John is tasked with expanding Ford&rsquo;s &ldquo;brought-in&rdquo; strategy of integrating mobile technology into the vehicle. John Musser John Musser is the CEO of API Science and previously founded ProgrammableWeb, the leading online resource on open APIs. Marten Mickos Marten Mickos is CEO of Eucalyptus Systems, the leader in open source cloud computing platforms for on-premise use. Previously as CEO of MySQL AB, Marten grew that company from a garage start-up to the second largest open source company in the world. Phil Windley Phil is the founder and CTO of Kynetx, which provides a cloud-based application platform that is uniquely architected to use events, personal data, and APIs to create social products and services. Pratap Ranade Pratap is the Co-founder of Kimono Labs - Kimono makes it easy for developers turn web data into APIs. His work on APIs and Big Data has been published in Forbes and the McKinsey Quarterly. This group of speakers represents what API Strategy &amp; Practice is all about, with speakers ranging API veterans like John Musser, pillars of the american economy from Ford, cloud computing pioneers, the future of APIs, and tech diversity leaders like Ashe Dryden. &nbsp; API Strategy...[<a href="/2014/05/01/come-talk-api-strategy-and-practice-in-chicago-september-2426th/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 May 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I spoke on the business of internal APIs at the IBM Impact conference in Las Vegas, this last Tuesday. About 15 people attended my talk, but the conversations I had with folks afterwards, signaled to me that my talk was a success.
I do not expect IBM or the enterprise to listen to my brand of API evangelism, but I&rsquo;m still determined to better understand the collision of the enterprise with the open  world of web APIs. Even if I convert just one or two individuals at any event, my mission was a success.

Impressed that IBM invited @kinlane to speak at #IBMImpact. Maybe this isn&rsquo;t your father&rsquo;s IBM!
&mdash; Michael Facemire (@ASocialFace) April 29, 2014

As I walked around the event talking to people I was reminded of how hungry the enterprise is for conversation about the API space that aren&rsquo;t linked to a product or particular company. As soon as people realize I have no sales pipeline, and I&rsquo;m genuinely trying to understand the space, and help them be successful, the tone always shifts dramatically.
You can find my slide deck for the talk on Github, unfortunately its in my minimalist style, so you need to have my narration&mdash;maybe I&rsquo;ll work on longer post to summarize what I covered during the talk. I&rsquo;ll have more thoughts on my experience at IBM Impact in Vegas, but will publish as separate posts across Kin Lane, and API Evangelist.

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been studying the API space exclusively for the last four years, and have worked hard to try and understand the space by studying the history of APIs, and as a result I can confidently say we are smack dab in the middle of what I consider to be an enterprise phase. In 2013 and 2014 I&rsquo;ve seen the enterprise across multiple business sectors turn their attention to this curiosity called the web API. So why is the enterprise so interested in APIs? Many technologists from the enterprise claim that it is no difference than their own earlier SOA efforts, but there has to be more under the hood, that is attracting the enterprise, beyond just a shiny new label, API&mdash;so what are they?

			<p><em>25 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>The number of APIs in government has grown significantly in the last couple of years, increasing access to public data, potentially driving the private sector to build web and mobile apps around government resources data. Even with this growth in API deployment and resulting app development, this movement has been severely handicapped by one aspect&mdash;99% of these APis are read only, you cannot write data to government via APIs. APIs being a two way street is one of those subtle, but very important aspects of API operations that can define whether an API initiative will be success or not. Since government is so risk averse, most entities are afraid of what can happen when they launch APIs, and completely terrified around what will happen with an API that people can write data to. I&rsquo;ve been pushing for more read / write APis in government for some time now, and for the first time I'm seeing the potential for things to change, with a new beta API project from the We The People API. I couldn't think of a better program to test a writable API for, than We The People&mdash;pushing the democratic powers of web APIs. First, what is We The People? We the People is the White House's petitions platform -- giving people a new way to petition the government. The way it works is pretty simple: People can create or sign petitions on WhiteHouse.gov. If it gets enough support (i.e. signatures), it will receive an official response. And with more than 13 million users, it's been a big success. Second, why an API? An API opens up the petition platform to exist within any website, application and mobile applications. A read API allows for content to display on any site or app, and a write API allows for participation in the petition process via any site or app&mdash;changing the dynamics of the petition process, moving it off of just .gov websites, ultimately evolving...[<a href="/2014/04/25/a-rare-beast-in-government-the-write-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I just finished up participating in an API specification session for Green Button data with Southern California Edison (SCE), San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (SDG&amp;E), and Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E). The discussion at one point during the last day was around &ldquo;chunking&rdquo; of huge data sets that a provider wants to allow for download over http. The group has been talking about scenarios for how this will work, and after over an hour they are getting to some pretty edge case scenarios surrounding &ldquo;chunking&rdquo;. As I listen, I can&rsquo;t help but thinking about he pros and cons of upfront planning vs. iterating on your API over time. Are they planning for scenarios that will never happen, and building in development time for use cases that may never become a reality? They know their data and industry best, so I am not educated enough to make a determination, but it doesn't stop me from having these thoughts. I understand that large companies, like wihtin the utility inudstry, have to plan as much as they can, as they operate in a pretty unforgiving environment when it involves physical integrations, government regulations, and other constraints in the industry. Even with this understanding, I think some larger institutions are very used to planning, and covering every possible scenario that they can think of, and in the process, spending unnecessary resources, and also limiting any positive unknowns from occurring. Developers from the open API space definitely have to better understand planning, and doing their due diligence before just leaping, but I also think the enterprise will have even more challenges when it comes to letting go and realizing the innovation that can occur around APIs. That you can cover your ass by considering the obvious negative scenarios, then building quality management tooling and processes, and identify other negative scenarios in realtime--when you actually have the data evidence to support.

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking on education and university APIs for a while now, but after kicking off some work on the FAFSA API prototype, and preparing a response for to the request for information (RFI) on the use of APIs in higher education data and student aid process, I'm ramping up the time I&rsquo;m spending on education related APIs. APIs in higher education is also one of the areas 3Scale and API Evangelist are partnering, to help define what the API landscape looks like across higher education institutions, and as I do with other business sectors, we are looking to stimulate the API conversation amongst existing leaders from the space&mdash;online, and offline at as many events as we can. In support of all of this, I went through the API efforts of 10 institutions I&rsquo;m currently monitoring, to see what was new, reacquainting myself with what each of the institutions were up to. My primary goal was to establish a list of the common services that other universities could offer, based upon these existing API leaders, and I was well on my to compiling a pretty robust list, until I got to Brigham Young University (BYU), and I was blown out of the water. BYU wins the API deployment game within a university with the 261 web services they have listed in their registry. Every aspect of university operation is represented as a web service, and as you scan down the list, and you look at the XSDs, you realize how much work went into their API stack. There are definitely some interesting things going on at University of Washington, UC Berkeley and in Poland around university APIs, but BYU blows everyone away. I will go through the list of web service from BYU, clean up a little, and use to seed a general list of potential services that other universities could use when planning their own API program.

			<p><em>22 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>I was introduced to the ReliefWeb API last week, which provides information including reports, jobs, training, countries, and source details on global crises and disasters going back to 1996. The ReliefWeb API follows a trend of organizations realizing not just the potential of APIs for delivering content to mobile applications, but also the benefits of opening up publicly. As the site states: The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) originally built the ReliefWeb API to power a mobile version of the ReliefWeb website. Since then they have normalized the interfaces for public consumption, hoping that &ldquo;developers can build tools that increase exposure for valuable content and facilitate analysis for better decisions.&rdquo; The ReliefWeb API provides seven valuable API endpoints: Discovery - Providing discovery, navigability and insight into other APIs. Reports - Content API of updates, headlines and maps available on ReliefWeb. Jobs - Job offers available on ReliefWeb. Trainings - Training opportunities available via ReliefWeb. Countries - Countries from Reliefweb. Disasters - Disasters tracked on as part of ReliefWeb. Sources - Sources of information available on ReliefWeb. The design of the API is pretty well thought out, providing some common, as well as some forward thinking technical elements: Documentation - Detailed information about all API endpoints, including content types, versions, data model, including full text and interactive version using Swagger. Hypermedia - Control links facilitate paging, deep cross-linking of content allows navigating between related resources, and all resources can be reached by drilling down from the top level of the API at http://api.rwlabs.org. Caching - Uses Cache-Control headers to point out how often ReliefWeb recommends checking for updates. I started playing around making some calls and enjoyed the way the API flows, and excited about the potential. I do have some critique of the implementation, with the hope of influencing their roadmap. Side Project The API initiative has a very side project feel.

			<p><em>18 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;ve been involved in a lot of conversations lately around turning government forms into APIs. Which seems like a great idea, right up until the part where I&rsquo;m thinking about the original workflow represented by many legacy forms, and realize that maybe this form was a bad idea to begin with.
If I develop an API for a form, and the original form all by itself is a bad idea, am I just making a bad idea worse, by attaching an API to it? I'd say yes!
I don&rsquo;t feel like this will be true in all situations. I think APIs will allow us to hopefully break free of what the original intent of a form was, explore new opportunities for gathering and managing data, and changing the concept of what a form is.
Even with the potential, I can&rsquo;t help but think APIs on forms may not be good in all scenarios. Then again, this isn&rsquo;t just limited to forms, before we attach an API to anything, we should probably think&mdash;is this a good idea?

			<p><em>17 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
The first consumer of all of my APIs, including my screen capture API is me. I develop my APIs first for my use, and only recently have decided to make available to the public. So when I sat down to create my service composition for my APIs, I needed to figure out what I was going to do about my internal consumption.
My first instinct was that I didn't need to include my internal API consumption alongside my partner and public API consumption. I quickly changed my tune as I realized that it was going to be important that I monitor my own API usage in the exact same ways I would partners or public consumers.
I need to better understand how I consume my own APIs, identify security breaches or just unhealthy ways I&rsquo;m consuming my own API resources. I've seen too many APIs like Instagram and even Tesla get burned by not having the proper management layer on their own internally consumed APIs--allowing hackers to get through doorways that weren't monitored.
While my internal API usage won't be billed as it will with my partner, retail or wholesale API consumers, it will be tracked, limited and analyzed alongside the other target API consumption groups.
I need to understand how my API resources are being consumed, and this includes my own usage. This is a very important lesson for all of us API providers to understand, helping us see the complete picture of how APIs are put to use.

			<p><em>17 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>The biggest impact APIs will have at your company will be the internal, cultural change regarding how you do business. We are in the middle of an explosion of APIs, and while there are many new public APIs emerging, the majority of growth is coming from the deployment of internal APIs. There is a lot that companies can learn from the open API movement over the last fourteen years, with many building blocks, and healthy practices that can be applied when internally deploying APIs. This is a topic I will be exploring on API Evangelist, and at the IBM Impact conference at the Venetian in Las Vegas, NV&mdash;April 27th through May 1st. The abstract from my talk, titled "Business of Internal APIs&rdquo; is: The largest area of growth in the last couple years of APIs is internally within the enterprise. There are numerous lessons that can be extracted from the world of public APIs, and applied internally within any company, helping increase agility, efficiency, while also helping develop new business lines. When it comes to APIs, the secret to success isn&rsquo;t all about technology, and this session will help introduce you to the business of internal APIs, extracted from the approach of leaders in the space. In my experience there are fundamental elements that make APIs successful, where more classic approaches like service oriented architecture (SOA) fall short. When companies are deploying APIs for internal consumption, you have to consider elements like self-service access, up to date API docs, code samples, and the human elements, that have made public API deployments successful. Even though internal APIs consumers will have some unique needs that your partner or public API consumers won't, there will also be many similar patterns across your internal, partner and public API customers that you will need to leverage.

			<p>If you read my blog regularly, you know I am constantly pushing the boundaries of how I see the API space, and sometimes my ramblings can be pretty out there, but API Evangelist is how I work through these thoughts out loud, and hopefully bring them down to a more sane, practical level that everyone can understand. My crazy vision for the day centers around virtual API stack composition, as beautiful as the Absolut Drinks Database API. Ok, before you can even begin to get up to speed with my crazy rant, you need to be following some of my rants around using virtual cloud containers like we are seeing from docker, AWS and OpenShift, and you need to watch this video from APIStrategy &amp; Practice about Absolut Drink Databse API deployment. Ok, you up to speed? Are you with me now? Today, as I was playing around with the deployment of granular API resources using AWS CloudFormations, I was using their CloudFormer tool, that allows me to browse through ALL of my AWS cloud resources (ie. DNS, EC2 Servers, S3 Storage, RDS Databases), and assemble them into a CloudFormation Templates, which is just a JSON definition of this stack I&rsquo;m going to generate. Immediately I think of the presentation from Absolut, and how they spent years assembling the image and video parts and pieces that went into the 3500 drinks they wanted available via their API, for developers to use when developing interactive cocktail apps. They had 750 images, and video clips, with a combination of 30K mixing steps, that went into the generation of the 3500 drink combinations. * mind blown * Now give me this same approach but for composing virtual API stacks, instead of cocktails. With this approach you could define individual API resources such as product API or screen capture API. These are all independent API resources, with open source server and client side code, openly licensed interface via API...[<a href="/2014/04/17/api-virtual-stack-composition-like-the-absolut-drinks-data-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I am evolving my own approach to deploying my API resources, and I needed an important sounding name for it, so came up with &ldquo;operational harness&rdquo; over a couple pints of IPAs. Ok, so what do I mean when I say operational harness?
Based upon the way that I evolve my stories, I evolve my API projects in real-time with the help of Github. For my screen capture API I will be focusing on delivering four separate architectural pieces:

Open Source Version - An open source, server implementation of my screen capture API, which will PHP initially with other languages next.
API Service - A publicly accessible, cloud version of the screen capture API, allowing users to a certain amount of calls in a specific time frame before they are charged a per call rate, depending on their service their. 
API Containers - OpenShift and AWS CloudFormation version of the screen capture API for rapid deployment in cloud environment.
Wholesale Service - A wholesale version of the screen capture that a partner can pay me to deploy and / or manage in mine or theirs cloud environment.

I call this my operational harness because I will be operating live instances of these components, scaling as I need in the cloud, but will also be maintaining the open source version, and container versions on Github, while also supporting wholesale deployment. &nbsp;My definition will act as a sort of harness holding together all the architectural pieces of the screenshot API, but also in sync with other utility APIs I will be deploying--helping guide me as I push it all forward.
I&rsquo;m enjoying putting together my strategy around my own API platform. It gives me some good material to work through for stories here on the blog, and helps me push forward with new approaches to API deployment, like deploying and scaling in virtual containers, and providing wholesale access to resources.

			<h3><a href="/2014/04/16/two-things-i-learned-on-traffic-and-weather-today/">Two Things I Learned On Traffic And Weather Today</a></h3>
			<p><em>16 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
If you aren&rsquo;t already familiar with Traffic and Weather, it is an extremely structured discussion between John Sheehan&nbsp;(Runscope) and&nbsp;Steve Marx&nbsp;(Dropbox), about "the latest API and cloud tools, news and technologies&rdquo;.
Its not often I learn something new from the show (kidding), but today I learned about two new things:



  
Flask RESTful - Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs. It is a lightweight abstraction that works with your existing ORM/libraries. Flask-RESTful encourages best practices with minimal setup. If you are familiar with Flask, Flask-RESTful should be easy to pick up.


  
Flynn - Flynn simplifies deploying and maintaining applications. Instead of using complex configuration management systems, Flynn allows self-serve management of containerized deployments, making life easier for ops and developers.



Its nice to hear more discussion about the evolution of deploying API resources and micro services, and the use of virtual containers from Docker, OpenShift and Cloud Formations&mdash;especially since its a topic Traffic and Weather and API Evangelist have discussed before. ;-)
Seriously though, they put on a good show, forward thinking API conversation, with lots of humor and not-so-funny humor mixed in. I always recommend listening when you have time, you might learn a thing or two about APIs along the way.&nbsp;
Tip: If it sounds like the show is almost over, it is. Turn off the podcast.

			<p><em>16 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I look at a lot of API developers areas in my work, and the first sign I see that nobody is home behind an API, is that their blog is out of date.
I found myself at the ESPN developer center last night, clicked on the blog, which has a great tag line of &ldquo;API-focused musings and rambling&rdquo;, but alas hasn't been updated in over a year.
Your API developer blog posts do not have to be anything master planned, and should just be thoughts from the daily life of running your API. A little effort goes a long way on your API developer blog, and when it becomes out of date, it also will send a strong signal to developers&mdash;nobody is home, don&rsquo;t use this API.
Make sure your API-focused musing and ramblings occur more than once very year, I know that personally I need it daily, but maybe you need it a little less frequent. ;-)

			<p><em>16 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
Its not often I find myself referencing Cisco when it comes to shedding light on interesting practices for the API space, but today is not your usual day.
At some point yesterday, I found myself at cisco.com, and I stumbled across their social page, which gives equal real estate to their blog, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Youtube channel, as well as highlights from their community forum.

I like the idea of having a page like this for API providers. It helps you establish a single page, that can act as a one-stop shop for getting information about what is going on within an API community.
From a planning perspective it also helps providers understand they need to have more than one channel when it comes to providing API support via social channels.
Cisco&rsquo;s social media page is a pretty basic example, but I think a potentially powerful one that API providers can follow when organizing their own social platform, for their own API communities.

			<p><em>16 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>I just wrote up a piece about how to deploy an API driven application backend using Orchestrate.io, and wrote a piece last week on API deployment using Solr and government data. After writing about both of these approaches, I can't shake the thought that external, API driven approaches like this will become commonplace in the next couple of years. Both the approach using Solr, and the other using Orchestrate.io, identify that data is available via a machine readable data dump and even an API, but neither solution provide the simple web API access that would make application development easy. In both these stroies, 18F and Orchestrate.io are both looking to just get the job done, achieving their development goals--in one case deploy an API of federal business opportunities, and the other is to build a web application that will make browsing super hero characters easier. Granted these two scenarios have radically different outcomes, but both share a common approach to meeting their goals: Orchestrate.io - Uses Orchestrate.io to extract, store and normalize data from the Marvel API, making it much more accessible, searchable and usable in their MarvelousDB web application FBOpen - Uses Solr to mount and index business opportunities with the federal government in an XML dump, then deliver a web API so they can build the web interface for FBOpen, but also provide an open source API that anyone can use as is, or deploy on their own infrastructure Both of these approaches are all about making the data and content they need for web and mobile apps, easily accessible via a simple API. Both of these projects acknowledge the data source they have to work with doesn&rsquo;t meet their exact requirements, but for very different reasons. One project uses open source software to tackle their problems, while the other uses the latest cloud services to provide a solution&mdash;both get the job done.

			<p><em>15 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
There is a great post over on the Orchestrate.io blog about how they deployed a backend for the MarvelousDB app, using data from the Marvel API, allowing you to explore the world of Marvel comic book characters, through a simple web interface
As developers often face with valuable API resources, the Marvel API leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to available interfaces, data access, and rate limit restrictions. This is common with new APIs, where it takes time to understand the right levers and dials to turn, that will make the API more usable by developers.
Even with these challenges, the Orchestrate team wanted to build the MarvelousDB so they could easily browse the world of Marvel comic book characters, putting the Marvel API to use, but also showing what is possible when using Orchestrate.io. The result is a great example of dynamically building a backend from API resources, in a way that delivers the access and performance you need.

To deliver the MarvelousDB the project employs Node.js, Express.js, Orchestrate.js, Handlebars for templating, and Q for async operations. Using the Marvel API, they pull the data they needed to drive the app, pulling it into Orchestrate.io, giving them the data model and performance they needed, but also adding in capabilities like full text search on top of the data&mdash;something that isn&rsquo;t available from the Marvel API alone.
MarvelousDB is an great example of what is possible via the API driven, database as a service platform Orchestrate.io, but is also a great model to follow when developing web or mobile applications that depend on APIs. Sometimes APIs aren&rsquo;t structured exactly as we need, and we can use platforms like Orchestrate.io, to well&hellip;orchestrate exactly the backend experience we need to get the job done.

Each month I spend an hour or two maintaining this list, to make sure it is complete and actively change my logins when appropriate.&nbsp; I saw the recent Heartbleed SSL situation as an opportunity to move forward some of my IT practices, including using 1Password to manage all of my accounts, and better profiling which APIs I'm consuming. This gave me an opportunity to update my list of APIs that I depend on, adding about 4 or 5 new ones. First I depend on a couple of the core Google APIs: Gmail - Integrate my daily emails, as well as email blasts with my administrative system Google Contacts - Keep business and individual profiles in my admin system in sync with my daily Google Contacts activity. Google Calendar - Publish hackathon calendars to Google Calendar as well as keep conferences, meetups and other events I pull through APIs and curate in sync Google Docs - Publish copies of blog posts to Google Docs, as well as version of pages from my content management system to Google Docs Google Sites - All of my research is in Google Sites. So I tend to publish lists of curated news, blog posts and other research to wiki pages under specific projects Next, I would say Amazon Web Services delivers some pretty critical APIs I can't live without: Amazon EC2 - I deploy and shutdown various EC2 instances for various jobs I run for API Evangelist.

I use this API in my own platform, capturing what websites and applications look like for reference in stories, and other content. I want to make this valuable utility API available to a wider audience now. I need to compose some tiers of access to my screen capture API, that makes sense to my business goals and how it will be consumed by a variety of users. So far I&rsquo;ve come up with five levels of access to my API: Private / Internal - This is where my API is consumer currently, internally my own systems. I need this tier to be unlimited use, no charge, but still tracking on how I am consuming the screen capture API so I can evaluate along with all my other service levels. Private / Partner - I have partners who can make use of my screen capture API, I want to offer them special access to my resource, but I still want to track on how they are using the resource. Public / Free - To help attract new developers to my screen capture API I want to make open to the public, all you have to do is sign up for a key, and you can make a certain amount of calls in an hour or day, I haven't decided how much yet. Public / Retail - Once a user hits a certain amount of screen capture API calls I want to be able to charge a certain rate per call, allowing consumers to use as much as they want, but cover my operational costs, while making a little money on top.

			<p><em>14 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I reviewed the deployment the FBOpen API the other day, which is a simple API resource of&nbsp;business&nbsp;opportunities with the U.S. Federal Government. An interesting aspect of the FBOpen implementation was that 18F used Solr to deploy the API layer.
Solr is an open source search tool developed by the Apache Software Foundation, which can take any document store and easily generate a simple, yet pretty powerful web API&mdash;opening up access to content, without costly infrastructure. I showcased how the Free Law Project launched the Court Opinion API, using Solr, opening up access to archives of legal documents from across the country.
18F took XML dumps of business opportunities from FBO.gov, then deployed Apache Solr as the API layer. You can download or fork 18F&rsquo;s FBOpen API, and deploy the API in your own infrastructure. This provides a pretty interesting blueprint for how government can easily open up data, then launch an API for developers to build on top of.
I&rsquo;m thinking that government data dumps, plus web API deployed using Solr, plus interactive documentation deployed via Github, combined with frictionless API access via api.data.gov or 3Scale, open licensing and terms of use&mdash;all sounds like a pretty health formula for open, reusable government API infrastructure.
Along with other healthy patterns for API design, deployment, management and evangelism I find out in the API space, I think what 18F has done with the FBOpen API, needs highlighting. I think government data plus web API using Solr is a recipe I&rsquo;d like to see used across all government projects.

			<p>After the recent heartbleed security fiasco, I&rsquo;m spending my weekend going through my list of online services that I depend on, changing my passwords, and along the way I&rsquo;m going to reclaim as much of my domain as I can. I will be asking some questions of each online service, questions like, why do I use this service? does this service have an API? Questions that will help me establish a profile of that service, to better understand how I use it, and whether there is any valuable content or information I should be organizing in a better way. I produce a lot of content each day, and on the surface it seems like I maintain control over most of this, but in reality my content resides in online services like Twitter, LinkedIn, and other places that I frequent daily. I do a pretty good job of centrally managing the blog content I generate each day. I have a central CMS where I create my blog entries, and then syndicate to my network of 60+ Github repositories, that use Github Pages + Jekyll. When it comes to my social media streams, I do a very poor job of maintaining control over my network. I do not store my Tweets, Facebook, Linked or other social streams anywhere. I don&rsquo;t centrally sync my network of friends and business contact, until recently. I now have a central CRM alongside my blog CMS, but I&rsquo;m just getting started there. Overall, there is just a lot of content I generate on the Internet, and in addition to understanding my online footprint, to make sure it is secure, I want to make sure I maintain as much control over the intellectual exhaust I generate each day, as I can.

I purchased kin lane.com from a website hosting provider I found online, and after they drained over 1K from my bank account for a simple $10.00 website and domain purchase, they proceeded to squat on my domain for almost two years. Eventually I got my domain back, but it taught me some serious lessons about navigating this new online world we were creating for ourselves. Fast-forward ten years, and I&rsquo;ve not just learned a lot more about operating online, I have generated quite a bit of content, and value within my domain, giving me even more reason to protect not just my domain, but my brand. I produce a lot of content online, in the form of Tweets, blog posts, and other online exhaust from my daily life as the API Evangelist, and it is in my best interest to control as much of this content as I can. While I have my online brand to protect, and overall I have a heightened awareness around my online persona, this is something everyone should learn about. You may not have a valuable blog, online portfolio or other valuable online assets, but eventually you might. No matter who you are online, you should work to understand where your content, images, video and other assets you generate reside, and retain as much control over them as possible.

			<p>I have been using 3Scale API Infrastructure to manage API Evangelis's public APIs for almost two years now. My APIs provide access to my blog posts, news I curate, and the tools I track on. I also use the same infrastructure to secure and manage various projects I work on. You can view a list of my APi deployments on my API account management home page. In reality I haven't been all that serious about the management of my APIs until now. I have enough content I&rsquo;d like to make available via APIs, and I have a growing number of new APIs, some of which I'd like to make available for a fee, and see if I can&rsquo;t generate some new revenue streams off my research. Until now I've been on the 3Scale base plan, which is free and allows for 150,000 API transactions a day, and all the API management tools I needed to get going. This has been plenty for me to get my APIs established, but now I&rsquo;d like to be able to generate more API transactions, as well as be able to bill for API usage if I choose. With this in mind I've finally upgraded beyond the basic 3Scale plan to the plus plan, which at $125.00 / month gives me up to 250,000 calls a day, and the ability to charge for access to select APIs, opening up the possiblity to generate revenue on some of my content and programmatic resources. The ability to sign up, deploy and management my APIs until I found my way, has been essential to me getting to this point. I would not have been able to play with different configurations of access to my APIs, without 3Scale. This ability to on-board into the world of APIs, experiment and iterate, before having to pay a monthly fee is essential to many companies figuring out what this whole API thing is about.

			<p>Earlier this year I created a screen capture API, filling a need I have across my network&mdash;capturing an image snapshot of any web page. Not all APIs are created the same, but I think this screen capture API represents a very fundamental layer of the API economy, the utility API. This API isn't Twitter or Google Maps, it does one thing and it does it well&mdash;something most APIs should work hard to achieve. I've been using my screen capture API internally for several months now, and I think it is time to do more with it. I want to make this API available publicly, but I don&rsquo;t want to just make freely available to anyone on the open Internet, to use as much as they want. I want to create an access layer, using 3Scale API infrastructure management that allows me to control who has access, and what they can, or cannot do with it. To help me plan the next steps for my screen capture API I'm working on: Service Composition - An outline of the different ways I will sell access to my screen capture API Operational Harness - An overview of how I will deliver these API services to my target customers My goal in all of this is to generate stories for API Evangelist, but I also want to push forward my own understanding of how API resources can be delivered, and what better way than providing my own APIs. I have a number of other APIs I would consider very utility in nature, that I want to launch, but I&rsquo;m going to focus on just the screen capture API for now, and try to establish a blueprint I can use across all of my APIs.

			<p>As the API Evangelist I spend a lot of time cheering for companies to have APIs, and in 2014 I&rsquo;m continuing a slow shift from cheerleading to calling out companies who do not have an API. If you are an older company or institution I will be a lot more forgiving about whether or not an API exists, but with newer tech companies, there is NO excuse --an API is mandatory! As a digital citizen in 2014, you should not use any online service that doesn&rsquo;t allow for data portability, which starts with the ability to just download a complete file of all your account settings and data, and is fully realized when a fully read/write API exists, with the support of a healthy, vibrant API community. If a company doesn&rsquo;t provide you with these basic data portability features, you are most likely in a hostage situation where you are generating content and value for a company, with no say in how your content is used, monetized or even removed. I am reminded of an example of a modern tech company, who is harvesting the knowledge and wisdom of the crowd, but offers nothing back in return to its users, by Andy Baio (@waxpancake): Worth noting: Quora has no public API, no backup/export tools, blocks anonymous display of answers, and banned the Wayback Machine entirely. &mdash; Andy Baio (@waxpancake) April 9, 2014 After I retweeted Andy&rsquo;s reminder, one of my followers said they would like to retweet, but they want to make sure it was true. Andy said to go look for their self, and that after over 300+ retweets nobody had challenged his statement--which the reply was he didn't have time. Well I have time to go look, and verify whether or not Quora has an API&mdash;let&rsquo;s take a look, and what better way than to just ask Quora! Does a Quora API exist? The short answer is yes.

As with APIs themselves, visualizing something like how an API platform can position itself in the emerging API economy, is very difficult to do&mdash;something that takes refinement, something I do by blogging, so here we go... Much like developers are looking into the details of each API call, using API integration tools like RunScope and APITools, to better understand how their applications are consuming APIs, API providers need to understand all the moving parts involved with successfully executing an API strategy.

			<p><em>10 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I just published a post showcasing Socrata's use of Github to deploy their new open data and API developer portal. There are numerous reasons for using Github as part of your API management strategy, with one of the main reasons being the collaborative features that Git, and the social coding platform Github introduce.
I've had the news about Socrata&rsquo;s new developer portal open for over a day now, and what triggered that story was seeing a link to the regulations API on data.gov, which not only just uses Swagger for the API definition, it employs a simple portal that is deployed using Github pages.
Deploying API developer areas on Github, using Github pages is nothing new, we've been doing it a while now. However there is a groundswell within federal government recently, so I think its worth noting&mdash;hoping other open data and API folks in government jump in too!
I like the basic layout of the regulations API portal. It is a simple overview, changelog, terms of service and interactive API documentation using Swagger. Then demonstrating one of the biggest benefits of deploying your developer portal on Github, it simply says: &ldquo;Help Improve This Content&rdquo;, directing users to edit, fork and submit a pull requests on the portal&rsquo;s Github repository&mdash;enabling anyone to improve the portal content, with the approval of the API administrator of course.

			<p><em>10 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
The end of last year I was asked to spent time thinking about three things: 1) An API for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)  2) Next steps for the Green Button API 3) API strategy for the overall United States Government. I managed to find the bandwidth to get two of the three projects active, but neglected to spend time on the Green Button API.
To support my research I established a Green Button API repository on Github, where  will track all my work. My goal is to pull together all the existing pieces of the Green Button API into one place, and evolve a strategy for taking Green Button API the next step. Like I did with the FAFSA API, I just want to explore what is possible, and jump start a conversation either within government and outside with other 3rd parties.
I've spent a few hours gathering what elements I could find about Green Button&mdash;existing sites, APIs, code, documentation, etc. Over the next couple of weeks I will spend more time connecting the dots, and tell the story via my Green Button API project blog.
If you have any resources I should consider, or would like to provide any feedback, you can use the Github issue management for the Green Button API repository.

			<p>Civic data platform Socrata has launched a new developer area to support developers who are building apps on top of city, county, state and federal data, as well as the publishers of this data. A release of a new developer area is always worthy of note in my tracking of the API space&mdash;anytime I see a tweet or blog post about the release of new developer area, I will visit to see what is going on. The first thing I find particularly interesting about Socrata&rsquo;s approach is that they published as a Github repository, using Github Pages. We are seeing more government developer areas move onto Github, because of the easy site hosting with Github Pages, and the benefits of managing your projects with Git, as well as social benefits of Github and its underlying API. Application Developers Socrata provides a wealth of information for application developers, including a getting started guide, robust API documentation, client libraries, and D3.js assistance for those looking to build visualizations on top of government data. Data Publishers On the other side of the coin, Socrata also provides data publishers with what they need to get started, clean and organize their data, and the ability publish or sync with the Socrata platform, providing R, Ruby and Java libraries that really jumpstart integration. The second thing I really like about the new Socrata portal is that it is more educational than it is technical, and tailored to onboard the next generation of government data publishers and consumers. Socrata doesn&rsquo;t just provide details about API endpoints, they provide information on what is JSON and HTTP verbs. From years of experience, Socrata has a firm grasp of the amount of education the space needs to get up to speed, and it shows in their developer portal. To provide some critique of the implementation, the formatting of the text wasn&rsquo;t the easiest to consume.

			<p>The mission of API Evangelist is all about bringing awareness of APIs to the masses. The biggest challenge I face in doing this, is that API Evangelist is primarily a blog, which means a chronological listing of content I produce. When you are new to the API space, you can start with home page, but then you have to start sprinting to keep up with what I'm dish'n up on the blog. I have been working to address this by deploying other static research sites like design, deployment, management, evangelism, monetization for API providers, and discovery and integration on the API consumption side&mdash;however, even with this work its not enough. This is why its great to see other resources emerge that help new API providers and consumers get up to speed on the space, while still remaining informative for the advanced users, or anywhere on the API proficiency spectrum. In this case I&rsquo;m talking about API Codex , the curated site for API news from 3Scale--if you want to find the best articles from the API space, addressing all levels of expertise, API Codex is the resource you are looking for. The first thing you see when you land on API Codex: Just getting started? Check out our API101 page! Then you can browse the best articles from the space, by level of expertise, and by tag, as well as find the best API stories organized by author. This isn&rsquo;t just a random stream of articles from the API space, it is the best of the best from the API space. There is also an API tools section along with the API news, showcasing the best in tooling for both API providers and consumers. As the API universe expands we are going to have to get better at organizing the most valuable educational API resource, and making them accessible to users.

			<p><em>09 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>Scraping has been something I&rsquo;ve done since I first started working on the web. Sometimes you just need some data or a piece of content that isn't available in a machine readable format, and the only way is to get it scrape it off a web page. Scraping is widespread, but something very few individuals or companies will admit to doing. Just like writing scripts for pulling data from APIs, I write a lot of scripts that pull content and data from websites and RSS feeds. Even though I tend to write my own scripts for scraping, I&rsquo;ve been closely watching the new breed of scraping tools like Scraperwiki: ScraperWiki ScraperWiki is a web-based platform for collaboratively building programs to extract and analyze public (online) data, in a wiki-like fashion. "Scraper" refers to screen scrapers, programs that extract data from websites. "Wiki" means that any user with programming experience can create or edit such programs for extracting new data, or for analyzing existing datasets. The main use of the website is providing a place for programmers and journalists to collaborate on analyzing public data I was first attracted to Scraperwiki as a way to harvest Tweets, and further interested by their web and PDF extraction tools. Scraperwiki has already been around for a while, founded back in 2010, and recently there is a new wave of scraping tools that have emerged: import.io Importio turns the web into a database, releasing the vast potential of data trapped in websites. Allowing you to identify a website, select the data and treat it as a table in your database. In effect transform the data into a row and column format. You can then add more websites to your data set, the same as adding more rows and query in real-time to access the data. Kimono Kimono is a way to turn websites into structured APIs from your browser in seconds.

			<p>When I first started API Evangelist, I wanted to better understand the business of APIs, which really focused on API management. Over the course of four years, the list of companies delivering API management services has expanded with new entrants, an evolved with acquisitions of some of the major players. Visit my API management research site for more news, companies, tools and analysis from this part of API operations. API Management In 2011, people would always ask me, which API management company will help you with deployment? For a while, the answer was none of them, but this soon changed with new players emerging, and expanding of services from existing providers. To help me understand the expanding API lifecycle I started two new separate research areas: API Design API Deployment Once you design, deploy your API, and you get a management plan in place, you have to start looking at how you are going to make money and get the word out. In an effort to better understand the business of APIs, I setup research sites for researching the monetizationand evangelizing of APIs: API Evangelism API Monetization As the API space has matured, I started seeing that I would have to pay better attention to not just providing APIs, but also better track on the consumption of APIs. With this in mind I start looking into how APIs are discovered and what service and tools developers are using when integrating with APIs: API Discovery API Integration While shifting my gaze to what developers are up to when building applications using APIs, I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice the rapidly expanding world of backend as a service, often called BaaS: Backend as a Service (BaaS) As I watch the space, I carefully tag interesting news, companies, services and tools that have an API focus, or influence the API sector in any way.

I stumbled into a pretty interesting use of Github yesterday, which I&rsquo;m seeing as part of a greater push from our government to use the popoular social coding platform. The government blog Govfresh held a live chat session with FCC CIO David Bray (@fcc_cio), where some really interesting questions were asked of the very progressive CIO.
I&rsquo;m going to break up a few of the questions into separate blog posts, what I wanted to highlight in this post was the use of Github as a chat forum, showing once again that the platform isn&rsquo;t just about managing code, but can be used to openly manage a multitude of collaborative government technical operations.
Luke Fretwell (@lukefretwell) opened up the discussion which ran for about an hour, asking Bray several questions, and then Steve Spiker (@spjika), myself and the infamous Alex Howard (@digiphile) chimed in with further questions&mdash;making for a pretty interesting discussion.
Govfresh used Gitchat, a way of turning Github Issue Management + Github APIs into a chat thread, for the conversation. I like this approach to managing and controlling a live conversation, with the ability to archive for future use. I think it is also a great way to help people in government understand that Github is more than just code, it is also about being very social and collaborative around technical ideas.

			<p>There has been some great coverage of the new group of tech specialists out of the GSA, dubbed 18F. According to their own home page, 18F: ...builds effective, user-centric digital services focused on the interaction between government and the people and businesses it serves. We help agencies deliver on their mission through the development of digital and web services. I know most of the team members from my work with the GSA, and my own time (albeit short) as a Presidential Innovation Fellow, and I am extremely optimistic about the potential of the team. This optimism is being seriously validated after looking through the groups recent release of the FBOpen API, which is a simple API resource to get access to opportunities to do business with the U.S. Federal Government. Use Existing Tools The 18F demonstrates their tech chops by not re-inventing the wheel when it comes to designing and developing the FBOpen API. After they downloaded the existing business opportunity XML dumps from FBO.gov, they employed Apache Solr to develop a thin API layer on top of the files. Solr does two things well, it provides a REST interface on top of document stores, and supports the Lucene query syntax, which provides a powerful query interface on top of the simple API. Beyond Solr, 18F also used Apiary and Github, to cobble together a platform for API operations, demonstrating their dedication to agility and speed. Simplicity Rules The FBOpen API interface adheres to API simplicity by providing logical, versioned URI for accessing the government business opportunities, with a query and data source parameter allowing you to tailor the source of your query. Then you can filter by noncompetes or closed opportunities, as well as controlling the number of results returned, including common pagination controls developers are used to when working with APIs. FBOpen API does one thing, and does it well--the calling card of successful APis.

I was just having another conversation about virtualized cloud containers like Docker.io, and the approaches from leading cloud providers like Amazon with Cloud Formations, and RedHat with OpenShift. This is a subject that seems to be coming up more and more, and is definitely something you&rsquo;ll see more of on API Evangelist, as well as being discussed at future API Strategy &amp; Practice and API Days.
John Sheehan (@johnsheehan)&nbsp;of Runscope put it best, a couple weeks back during a similar conversation:

@kinlane containers will do for APIs what APIs do for companies.
&mdash; John Sheehan (@johnsheehan) March 13, 2014

Virtual containers will make API driven resources even more agile, nimble and scalable--not just for providers, but also for consumers. Everything we have right now I&rsquo;d consider to be a retail API market&mdash;where even though APIs are sold b2b, they are generally a one-size fits all API solution. Think about when API resources become modular, customizable, scalable, wholesale resources that can be bought and sold, and deployed anywhere, making all digital assets into commodities that are ready for use in the API economy.
In preparation for some research on the subject, I pulled together my stories on this subject from the last couple months:

The Power Of Designing And Deploying API Driven Resources In Containers
Virtual Containers, Stacks, APIs And Application Management
Server Side API Templates On AWS Cloud Formation And OpenShift
Modular APIs Driven From Github Blueprints Using OpenShift
Deploy Instances Of APIs At Heroku Or PaaS Of Your Choice
Github As The Central Presence, Definition, Configuration, And Source Code For Your API
A Wholesale On-Premise Version Of My API For Sale

Hopefully I can organize some of my thoughts, review some of the more innovative implementations I&rsquo;m seeing out there, and shed even more light on how virtual containers are being used to deploy the next generation of APIs. If you are doing something cool in this space, please let me know.

			<p><em>07 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
The Internet of things (Iot), and security camera API platform evercam.io has submitted the API definition for their camera API to the API Commons.
I&rsquo;ve been impressed with the amount of leadership that is coming out of this new startup in a potentially very political, and inevitable aspect of the API economy&mdash;cameras.
Marco Herbst (@marcoherbst) of evercam.io approached me during #APIStrat in Amsterdam and expressed interest in submitting their Swagger API definition into the commons, and this last weekend we created the API Commons manifest and published to the commons.

When I spoke with Marco several months ago about API Commons, he took the importance of submitting an API definition to heart. By doing so evercam.io is saying that their API definition is significant in their industry, and something that others in the industry should follow.
This type of stance in an industry like Iot is going to become crucial in encouraging not just manufacturers to adhere to a common format, but also saving application developers and data scientists time when their are building Iot solutions.
Thanks evercam.io for sharing your API definition with the world, and taking your role and responsibility in defining an interface to a very important layer of the API economy, so seriously.

As I have evolved my blog from a content management system into an API industry monitoring system, much like other companies I work with, I&rsquo;m making the switch to use more APIs in my operations. As I roll out these APIs, I want to share them with you, here within the API Evangelist developer area.
Here at developer.apievangelist.com you will find APIs that give you access to the content I curate and turn into stories, the analysis I provide on the API space, and companies, tools and other resources that I use make API Evangelist go around.
Sometimes I will roll out APIs as separate projects, and other times I will roll them out here, the central API area for API Evangelist.  I&rsquo;m working to separate out some of my resources, much like other companies do in the space, and allow my internal systems to read / write, while also providing public and partner access to these resources. I am even working to create premium, pay for use API resources, but most of the time you will find my APIs are free.
If there is anything you&rsquo;d like to see me publish, let me know. You can use the issue management for the Github repository that houses this project to share any comments, thoughts or issues. Thanks for tuning in!

			<p><em>04 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
Last week at #APIStrat in Amsterdam, I had the pleasure of watching a keynote by Romain Huet (@romainhuet), Developer Advocate at Twitter, aptly titled &ldquo;connecting to the pulse of the planet&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of watching Romain give this talk twice now, and he really delivers&mdash;you can watch the whole video on Youtube.
Romain used Twitter as a conduit for not just one, but two live Internet of things (Iot) demos. First he took a live selfie of him and the audience with a Raspberry Pi camera he had developed, and second he made a drone take off on stage using commands he sent via Twitter.
When talking to Romain earlier in Amsterdam, we were discussing APIs and Iot, and I said that Twitter seems to be a wonderful gateway for developers, when it came to connecting devices to the Internet. As an API driven messaging channel, developers just get Twitter and its APIs, so it makes sense we&rsquo;d use this familiar channel for exploration communication in the Internet of things.
Twitter works well as a gateway API to Iot for developers because of its familiarity and ease of use, but it also immediately makes it social, allowing us to open up Iot communications to a trusted network, or even the public. While we don&rsquo;t want every device in our lives immediately social, it works well for us to learn new thing, allowing us to learn using tools we are already familiar with, and have a network of established friends.
Like it or not, I think many Iot devices will come pre-configured to work with our common social networks, and as the Iot world matures, we will find more logical ways to communicate with these devices in our lives&mdash;realizing that not everything needs to social and on the web, but in the early days we&rsquo;ll depend on these characteristics to understand how to make devices and sensors communicate.

			<p><em>04 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>
As I go through the management of my 60+ research sites that make up my API Evangelist network, I can't help but think about how I can automate specific aspects of the process. This is the way my custom built platform works, I have workflows and tasks I accomplish each day, and as I have time, I will write scripts and automate where I can.
In an ordinary week I will process hundreds of blog feeds, tweets and new APIs, and sometimes I&rsquo;m tempted to automated my curation, sorting, tagging and other aspects of what I do, but then I find valuable nuggets on company sites, blog and other places. Valuable insight that my algorithms wouldn't necessarily find, things that I can use in stories across the API Evangelist network, as well as expand my own knowledge.
Each day I work to strike this balance between manually monitoring the API space, and automating what I do. I am constantly re-evaluating whether something is better automated, and at what point does something need my critical eye.
As I write this post, I can't help but think about all the talk of automation via the web, mobile apps and Internet of things (Iot) each day, and hope that we all can find restraint, and apply critical thinking around how we best use Internet enabled technology in our lives&mdash;minimizing what we lose by automating our worlds.

			<p><em>03 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a wave of blog posts about additions to the developer and partner programs, of some of the leading APIs in the industry, making me think its time for some more research into the area. Partner programs come in several shapes and sizes, and go by different names, and are something I would like to understand better. I have several Evernote folders full of research on API partner programs, now I just need to polish it and publish it here on the blog, and possibly give it its own research repository on Github. Many companies consider their API partner programs, a type of partner all by itself. However when I talk about partner or developer programs, it is about establishing multiple tiers of API access, within an API developer ecosystem. When most think of APIs, a vision of an open, public API comes to mind&mdash;when in reality, many APIs will have multiple levels of access, with public just being the first rung of the partner ladder. Some APIs start with signing up to be a partner, and require developers share details of their integration idea, before they can gain access to an API. IBM does this with their Watson platform, requiring developers to share their idea, and wait for approval before they can access resources. I always recommend providing a open access version of API resources, something that is self-service, and can be accessed 24/7 by developers, but this won&rsquo;t be applicable with all APIs. To find solid examples of API partner programs, I wanted to start with the API pioneers, as they have been doing this a while, and have a great deal of experience managing very large, mature developer ecosystems. Salesforce This early pioneer in the API space crafted their AppExchange Partner Program to have two separate models that developers can take advantage of: ISVforce allowing developers to build, market, and sell apps only to salesforce.com customers at 15% cut, and Force.com...[<a href="/2014/04/03/taking-a-quick-look-at-the-leading-api-partner-programs/">Read More</a>]</p>

Last week at #APIStrat Amsterdam, I moderated, and presented in a session that was called API service descriptions. I gave the talk for the first 15 minutes, then Sumit Sharma (@sumitcan), Ole Lensmar (@olensmar), and Ruben Verborgh (@RubenVerborgh) followed me-- the full video is on Youtube if you are interested.
Over the last couple months I've been doing a deeper dive into the area of API design, with a specific look at API definition formats from API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, so the session was intended to help me continue the conversation, in person, on the stage at #APIStrat Amsterdam. I'm happy I did, because Ole came to the table with some valuable data on API definitions, that save me some valuable research hours.
I'm breaking up his work into several smaller posts, you can find his full deck on slideshare, first up is a comparison overview of each API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger:

Ole provides a nice overview of the three leading API definition formats, giving API providers a good side-by-side summary that can be used when deciding which format to support. I will work with Ole to help keep the numbers up to date, and include in my final research white paper for API design when finished.

			<p>I spend a lot of time looking through the websites of API companies, trying to understand not just the way they do business, but their role in their overall industry, or possibly how they influence other industries. I have been spending more time looking through the payment API space lately, and recently pulled together a list of key players in this space, as well as the common building blocks being used across the sector. Much like other significant areas of APIs like cloud computing, messaging, geo, and social, I can&rsquo;t help but consider the impact these payment APIs will have across all business sectors, and our government. The 50 building blocks I identified as part of my payment API research will not just be the essential components of the payment API space, but will ultimately be some of the building blocks of the API economy itself--take a look. Merchant Account&nbsp;- Creation, management and integration with merchant accounts that are required to process credit cards. Bank Account&nbsp;- Integration with existing bank accounts, for linking with payment workflows. Processor / Gateways&nbsp;- Access to multiple payent processors and gateways in multiple countries. Currencies&nbsp;- Ability to conduct transactions in multiple currencies, handling all the conversions for developers. Credit Card Transactions&nbsp;- The option to process major credit cards. ACH Transactions&nbsp;- The option to process transactions over the ACH network. Checks / Wire Transactions&nbsp;- The option to do bank to bank, wire and check transactions. Cash Transactions&nbsp;- The option to accept cash payments at retail locations. Virtual Transactions&nbsp;- The option to accept transactions for credits via virtual accounts.

			<p><em>02 Apr 2014</em></p>
			<p>API Infrastructure provider 3Scale has moved beyond just API management, with a launch of a new API integration service called APITools. 3Scale, one of the original API management providers, is moving out of just providing tools for API providers, and now targeting developers who are depending on API services for their web and mobile applications&mdash;catering to both sides of the API infrastructure coin. As developers depend on more API driven resources for their web and applications, the need to be in tune with the inner workings of an API is increasing. We don't just need access to the results of an API anymore, we need to understand the composition, performance and overall availability of the web APIs we depend on. The number of tools and services dedicated to assisting developers with API Integration is one of the fastest growing API areas, right along with API design. Getting In Front Of The APIs You Depend On APITools allows you to add all the APIs you depend on, whether they are public APIs like Twitter and LinkedIn, or the homegrown services of your own company and your partners. Once connected, APITools does all the work to profile communication with APIs, and how applications are consuming them. Establish Middleware Between Your Apps and APIs Without API integration tools, the inside of API calls are a black box. APITools doesn't just profile API transactions, it allows you to establish a middleware platform between your apps and the API they depend on. This middleware allows you to transform and inject elements into API transactions, allowing you to not just understand API operations, but force them to execute as you desire. Evolved Awareness Of How Your APIs Operate Once web API services are connected with APITools, and the middleware configured, the learning begins via a visual dashboard, providing you with intelligence on all API operations. This awareness of API operations can become real-time, with notifications of API events, staying in tune...[<a href="/2014/04/02/3scale-moves-into-api-integration-space-with-apitools/">Read More</a>]</p>

Sorry, while VC investment in companies that have APIs is a relevant data point, I just don't think its newsworthy enough to warrant its own blog post, usually just a tweet.
One thing that I did find interesting in this post, was the image depicting the distribution via the BandPages platform:

This image provides a very simple and clear way to articulate the value delivered via an API driven platform--showing users what BandPages does in a single image.
I wish every API I came across had an image like this, demonstrating what value the API delivers, in a very visual way.

			<p>I just got an email from an open data, API evangelist, working on a "New Zealand cross government program that is set up to deliver better public services for businesses and providing more and better APIs is a core vehicle that we have identified for that&rdquo;, who asked a question I see a lot, and thought I should do another post on: Should government provide the full download of datasets or encourage API access of data assets? The answer is both, but only if you have the resources to properly design, deploy, manage and evangelize the APIs, and you should always start with providing the full download of datasets. Many open data folks feel APIs are unnecessary when you have the full data download, but in reality this is a narrow view of the world&mdash;not everyone has the resources to consume entire data downloads, and there are so many lessons for government to learn from when providing APIs. Always Provide Raw Data Downloads Publishing of government data assets in machine readable formats like CSV, XML and JSON should be default for all government agencies. Period. If a dataset is not classified or contains personably identifiable information (PII), it should be available in a central location on government web sites for download. This is where ALL government agencies should start, before embarking on any API. Deploy APIs When Resources Are Available APIs should only be deployed by government agencies when they have the resources to do so properly. At the very least you should be able to properly design, deploy and respond via email requests around APIs in a timely manner. Nothing is more frustrating than integrating with an API where nobody is home. Also remember that EVERY API operations is short handed, even companies like Twilio and SendGrid could use more resources, so don&rsquo;t wait for the perfect resource levels before you launch, however you should make sure and give your APIs enough investment so...[<a href="/2014/03/31/should-government-provide-download-or-api-of-government-data-resources/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>31 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I am back in Los Angeles, after being in Amsterdam last week for API Strategy &amp; Practice. It's Monday morning, with the event ending Friday, and rather than being drained and exhausted, I'm still glowing and very charged and excited for APIs, after all the amazing discussions.
First off, thank you to 3Scale for making API Strategy &amp; Practice possible. Without 3Scale, not only would the event not exist, it would not have the tone that it does. 3Scale is investing in the conversation happening, with the priority being an open, inclusive community discussion around APIs&mdash;products, brands and companies are not the focus, API strategy and practice lead.
Second, thank you to all the sponsors, WSO2, IBM, Mulesoft, Pearson, BladeRunnerJS, Context.io, NGINX, Node1, API Days, Apiary, Application Developers Alliance, Amsterdam Marketing, Nordic APIs, SendGrid, and WIP. Without these company&rsquo;s support, the conversation wouldn't happen.
Third, thank you to the 96 speakers who elevated the API conversation at #APIStrat, bringing the stories of their API efforts to the event. There are already three of the talks up on the APIStrat Youtube channel, and the rest will be going up over the next couple weeks&mdash;if you weren't there, you have an opportunity to hear the talks.
I know 3Scale shares my vision of the event, and once again we nailed it! #APIStrat was the open and inclusive discussion of APIs I feel is critical for moving the industry forward. It is this type of open, vendor neutral discussion occur regularly around the globe, otherwise we just operate within our silos, and will never achieve the interoperability, integration and reciprocity that is needed to make the API economy work in a healthy way.
Thanks everyone for making such an amazing #APIStratAMS!

			<p><em>21 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I spend a lot of time each week reading the blog feeds, and twitter streams from the best API providers in the space. In my opinion this represents the lowest hanging fruit in my API monitoring, where the stories just land in my lap, delivered to me by my feeds&mdash;then once I've picked all this fruit, I find myself looking through the Twitter followers of many of these APIs.
The Twitter followers can contain some really interesting gems from across the API sector that I wouldn't find through my normal channels. By manually browsing the Twitter followers for APIs I&rsquo;m looking for:

People - Interesting folks doing innovative stuff across the API space.&nbsp;
Companies - New startups that have trouble cutting through the noise in space.&nbsp;
Stories - The lesser known stories that I see when looking through my unique lens.&nbsp;
Services - API related services that might be shifting from the norm, pushing the API space forward.&nbsp;
Tools - Developers are notoriously bad at marketing their work, and I find some cool tools on Twitter.

I have tools that I have developed that help me filter, search and easily look through thousands of Twitters followers, but I also find manually looking through them allows me to find the gems that my algorithm can&rsquo;t always find. A balance of programmatic and human approach to scanning the followers seems to work best.
Some of my best companies, individuals and stories I&rsquo;ve written, have come from trolling through Twitter followers. While I focus on my core feeds to understand the space daily, each week I try to remember to expand my network, adding new users, and blogs to my network, and Twitter followers is a great place to do this.

			<p><em>21 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
The first day at API Strategy &amp; Practice is always workshops that expose you the world of APIs, and #APIStrat in Amsterdam next week is no different. We had four workshops, but successful development and deployment best practices to secure, monitor and manage APIs, by Isabelle Mauny, Director of Product Management at WSO2 is already sold out.
That leaves us with three workshops currently available:

API-First Development with RAML from Daniel Feist, Architect @ Mulesoft
Introduction to APIs from Kirsten Hunter and D. Keith Casey
CitySDK APIs Boosting Civic App Development from Hanna Niemi-Hugaerts, Project Manager at Helsinki, Forum Virium

I know most of them are getting full and I see emails coming with regularly with new registrations, so if you are interesting in participating in any of these workshops head over to the workshops page #APIStrat.
Remember that #APIStrat isn't just for the seasoned developer, there are many sessions to get you up to speed on APIs, including Kirsten&rsquo;s and Keith&rsquo;s Introduction to 101, and the workshops on Civic API hacking is meant for everyone looking to make a change in our government works.
I look forward to seeing you there next week.

			<p><em>21 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
Content and data aggregation provider Gnip just announced a new API from their &ldquo;Plugged In Partner&rdquo; Brandwatch, who launched the Brandwatch API, giving developers access to social data, filtered through their a brand lens, so they can build custom tools, visualizations and other apps around Twitter data.
The Brandwatch API itself isn't that groundbreaking, there are plenty of other social analysis APIs offering similar features, but the fact that it was an API built on top of Gnip, one of the only approved Twitter firehose providers remaining, I found to be interesting.
Gnip is trusted Twitter provider, with firehose access to Twitter data, and Brandwatch is a trusted Gnip partner, providing an API with access to Twitter data. At this point I can't tell if I&rsquo;m in a dream, or a dream within a dream?
I feel like we've moved into a strange post Twitter API apocalypse land where turmoil in the Twitter ecosystem has died down, Gnip and other Twitter partners are thriving, and we are even seeing new APIs being built on Twitter data. I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about this, to be honest I can't tell if I&rsquo;m awake anymore.

			<p><em>19 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I&rsquo;m adding the API Rating Agency to my stack of companies who deliver in the area of API discovery.  The API Rating Agency helps API consumers understand each API provider on a whole list of metrics, ranging from terms of service to platform uptime.
Rating of APIs has been a nut I&rsquo;ve been trying to crack for a couple years now, resulting in a ranking system that is more human, than algorithm&mdash;so I know how hard  it is to go through hundreds of APIs, and develop some sort of coherent ranking system.
The API Rating Agency is a work in progress. I know they are hard at work reviewing API providers, so if you have an API make sure and contact them and see how you can put together a package that will help them understand your API.
To achieve the scale we need in the API economy, we will have to have an unbiased, 3rd party ranking, kind of sorta like Moody&rsquo;s or Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s, but hopefully more neutral. Developers have to be able to understand which platforms they can depend on.
You can catch Jonathan Bourguignon (@jon_bou) of the API Rating Agency at API Strategy &amp; Practice next week in Amsterdam, participating in the discovery and trust session&mdash;I hope to see you there!

			<p><em>18 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>I'm going through the schedule for API Strategy &amp; Practice next week in Amsterdam, getting intimate with each keynote, panel, and session, and their speakers. On day one we have a keynote from Mike Amundsen (@mamund), API Architect at Layer7 titled, "Self-Replication, Strandbeest, and the Game of Life What von Neumann, Jansen, and Conway can teach us about scaling the API economy&rdquo;. I have not seen this talk by Mike, so I have no idea what he is planning, but I have to share an epiphany I had when I first contacted Mike about speaking at #APIStrat Amsterdam. Mike had responded to my initial email asking me what I was interested in having him talk about, which I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Mike&rsquo;s approach to storytelling, so I&rsquo;m leaving it up to him. However Mike responded with a link to Strandbeest, simply stating he would like to incorporate this into a talk. As I watched Strandbeest I had a realization, this was a physical manifestation of what I envision as API driven application architecture for the API economy. Over the years I had built up visualizations in my mind of what architecture will look like when you are building applications with not 1 or 2, or 10 or 20 API, but hundreds of API driven resources, all working together in concert for a single outcome. The Strandbeest is the first physical object I've seen to come close to what i was seeing in my minds eye, and even more telling was that it was Mike Amundsen who introduced me to this object. When you watch the Strandbeest video, imagine each tube as a single API, and each resulting "beest" as a system or application you intend to build with APIs. Imagine being an architect at this scale, orchestrating hundreds of APIs into a workflow, or series of workflows that produces a virtual "strandbeest" that doesn't just run on the beach, but operates within the API...[<a href="/2014/03/18/strandbeest-apis-and-orchestrating-the-api-economy/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>18 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>I use both Bitly and Google shortened URLs to track activity across my networks. I don&rsquo;t just track click throughs, I also track image impressions for many of my projects and partners. This usage of shortened URLs lets me quantity the scope of my network, and understand interest across the network in the form of impression and click-throughs. After talking with Plot.ly about their embed strategy for API driven data visualizations, the topic of a sensible API branding has floated to the top of my story list again. I consider an APIs branding strategy to be an important building block that contributes to the politics of an API and its ecosystem (both internal and external). If an API branding strategy is too strict, it can turn developers off from using your API, but a well planned branding strategy that includes a healthy suite of embeddable tools can be a serious asset, and go a long way in satisfying internal concerns about brand integrity--which is major concern for companies when it comes to API deployment. What is a branding strategy? At its simplest it is about providing your API developers with a set of simple links and / or images that they should publish on their site, providing attribution for API resources consumed. A complete branding strategy provides the links, images and possibly JavaScript tools, as well as guidance on how they should be published on websites and within apps, providing proper attribution. In the context of a basic API branding strategy, URL shorteners can provide a wealth of data about the scope of your API ecosystem, as well has help measure specific activity across deployments by your developers. You should be able to quantity the impressions and click throughs everywhere your API resources are put to use. Of course, a healthy API partner structure also allows for developers to opt out of tracking and possibly deploy white label solutions. What does your branding strategy look...[<a href="/2014/03/18/building-more-metrics-into-your-api-branding-strategy-to-quantify-your-reach/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>18 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I'm continuing my journey through the session line-up at API Strategy &amp; Practice next week in Amsterdam, next up is the API discovery and trust session, where the conversation will be about API directories, service descriptions and of trust and rating systems for APIs.
Speakers for the API discovery and trust session are:

Bruno Pedro (@bpedro), CTO at CloudWork
Jonathan Bourguignon (@jon_bou), Co-founder at Reelstorm and APIRatings.org
Rix Groenboom (@rix_groenboom), Solution Architect at Parasoft
Stefan Rust (@srust99), Founder &amp; CEO at Exicon

It will be tough to decide between the API design and development and this one in the first session, on Day 1 for me. Thankfully that everything is recorded!
API discovery is an area we have a lot of work to do to prepare for the explosive growth in the space. It is tough to find quality APIs, understand the differences between APIs, and know who you can really depend on after you&rsquo;ve integrated into your applications.  This will be an important session.

			<p>In preparation for a fireside chat with Tyler Singletary at API Strategy &amp; Practice next week I&rsquo;m reviewing many of what I consider the political API building blocks, and reading some of my past stories to refresh my thoughts on the most pressing topics in the space. The technical building blocks of APIs are pretty clear at this point, and the business of APIs has been being hammered out over the last five or so years, by API infrastructure providers like 3Scale, but the politics of APIs are an aspect of the API economy we are going to see become more and more of a hot topic as the space continues its growth. There are a handful of building blocks that are clearly driving how APIs are used (or not used): Legal &nbsp; Branding&nbsp;- Along with the other business assets made available via an API ecosystem, the API owners brand is also being put on the on the line. Branding Guidelines set the tone for how partners and developers can use the resources and assets made available via an API. The branding guidelines will provide a framework for attributing the API owner, how resources can be displayed and provide visual assets to support the company brand. As with terms of use and privacy policies, branding guidelines need protect the API owner but also provide developers with enough freedom to innovate. &nbsp; Terms of Use / Conditions&nbsp;- Terms of Use provide a legal framework for developers to operate within. They set the stage for the business development relationships that will occur within an API ecosystem. TOS should protect the API owners company, assets and brand, but should also provide assurances for developers who are building businesses on top of an API. Make sure an APIs TOS pass insepection with the lawyers, but also strike a healthy balance within the ecosystem and foster innovation. &nbsp; Privacy&nbsp;- Privacy policies protect the rights of partners, developers and platform users...[<a href="/2014/03/17/politics-of-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>17 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
The API space has been pretty easy to monitor until recently, with most API efforts being public, but lately everything is trending is towards internal APIs, making it a lot harder to track on what some companies are up.
I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for new signals I can use to track on what companies are up to when it comes to their API strategy. A signal I&rsquo;ve been using for a while, but is an increasingly important part of my monitoring, is the job posting for API architect, developer and evangelists.
An example of this is the posting for an API platform engineer from video collaboration platform BlueJeans. We know that BlueJeans gets APIs when it comes to integration, but there isn&rsquo;t much public discussion about their internal API initiatives or any publicly available developer program.
According to the job posting BlueJeans is looking for a developer to help in, "building and scaling the API platform of our cloud application". It is pretty clear that APIs is what make the video collaboration platform operate, and I will add BlueJeans to my list of companies using APIs, just not into showcasing it publicly.
In the future, job postings will be just one of many signals we use to understand how companies are using Apis. I&rsquo;ll do what I can to get companies to share stories publicly about their APIs, but in some cases I don&rsquo;t think that companies are ready, and not used to talking about their operations in this way.

			<p>Its always funny to come across the hyperbolic folks that exist in technology, that blindly believe that technology will save us. I seem to get attract a lot of these people with my API Evangelism (its the name), which on the surface I can imagine seems like I'm advocating use of APIS BY EVERYONE, in ALL SITUATIONS--when in reality, this is furthest from the case. At API Evangelist, I focus on having conversations about APIs in all situations, but not necessarily the deployment or consumption of APIs. I don't think APIs by themselves are a solution. I think APIs employed by a savvy business and technology team, providing access access to valuable data, content and other resources to consumers, are a good idea. My missions is for: businesses to understand how APIs can potentially benefit them, and change how they operate internally, with partners and the public at large and even influence how an entire industry operates government of all shapes and sizes to know that APIs can help democratize access to public resources, empowering the public to help share the load of governing cities, counties, states / provinces and countries every individual to realize the messages, photos, banking, location, and other information they depend on via their cell phone travels through APIs, and that they, the end-user has an important role to play I do not want every business and object in our life to have an API and be connected to the Internet. I evangelize an awareness and healthy understanding of APIs by everyone, as well as sensible approaches to designing, deploying, managing and evangelizing APIs. This is what happens at API Strategy &amp; Practice. If we were just pushing APIs for everything, the name would be something like APIs - Do It! In reality the conference in Amsterdam next week will be a mix of business and technical folks, listening to the stories from API leaders, about their strategy and practices from...[<a href="/2014/03/17/its-not-just-about-doing-apis-its-about-having-conversation-about-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t have a love of infographics, mostly because they more graphic, than info, and I&rsquo;ve stated before that all infographics should have the data behind them. I&rsquo;ve been working with data of over 20 years, I thoroughly believe in its importance when used right, but it seriously pisses me off when it is distorted in support of any argument&mdash;whether I agree with the argument or not. This sentiment is shared by a startup I was introduced this last week, called Plot.ly. I had a great conversation Nolan Browne the co-founder &amp; chief business officer at Plot.ly, and he conveyed to me about how serious Plot.ly is about providing embeddable, API driven data analysis and visualizations tools that really empower data stewards. First, I really like Plot.ly because it is JSON driven. Next they provide you with all the web-based tool you need to import, manage and share data in a way that lets you collaborate and publish along the way. Plot.ly even provides an API to help you manage everything about your data analysis and visualization work. The most important thing about Plot.ly is that each visualization is embeddable, like a Youtube video, allowing you to share not just the visualization, but also the data behind it. Each embeddable Plot.ly visualizations contains the entire story behind it, allowing you to understand the credibility of the author, and how the data has evolved, and potentially adding your own stamp on its history with the ability to save, reverse engineer, and edit in your own Plot.ly account. Plot.ly has some pretty impressive tools for importing, analyzing and visualizing data, but I think its samples and gallery, with the ability to save and fork the works of others which will make it work for the masses. Data stewards across the government, and private sector need not just the tools, but simple blueprints they can reverse engineer, helping them understand how they can better analyze and visualize their...[<a href="/2014/03/17/i-always-want-to-see-the-data-behind-and-so-does-plot-ly/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>14 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>Building off a conversation I had with a fellow evangelist in the federal government today, regarding API service level agreements (SLA), I wanted to talk through some thoughts I&rsquo;m having about a couple of key API building blocks. Reflecting what I see across the API space, API terms of service (TOS) are the legal agreement that API consumers agree to before using an API resource. API best practices, tends to reflect what the API TOS lays out, but are delivered in plain english, avoiding the legalese of the standard TOS. When these two building blocks (terms of service, best practices) are deployed well, an API consumer can easily make a decision on whether an API is in alignment with their goals, then also being able to pass it off to the lawyer for a deeper analysis. Secondarily, API service level agreements (SLA) are the legal agreement that API providers agree to when offering up their service for consumption--setting the bar for what API consumers can expect from a service provider. While TOS, SLA and best practices involve both API providers and consumers, I&rsquo;d say the TOS and best practices lean towards guiding API consumer behavior. Where the SLA leans toward guiding the API provider behavior. What I&rsquo;m looking for is a phrase to describe the friendlier, plain english version of an SLA. I want a building block that API providers can use to set the same eexpectations that a low-level SLA would, but without the legal baggage that comes with an SLA. After reading through wikipedia entries, and several great articles on SLAs, and looking through what is contained in common SLAs, I&rsquo;m playing around with several phrases including operational understanding, operational accord, and service accord&mdash;leaning towards service accord, based upon the definition of accord: 1) give or grant someone (power, status, or recognition). 2) (of a concept or fact) be harmonious or consistent with. Like best practices, a service accord would explain service levels...[<a href="/2014/03/14/api-service-accord/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>One of the transformative experiences of my career was when I worked for SAP, running SAP events as VP of Engineering at WebEvents Global. When I started, I was handed an architecture that was completely hosted in a hostage colocation facility, where I had no support. Long story short is, I was able to redefine my architecture using an API-centric approach, coupled with AWS EC2 and S3 APIs, I re-deployed infrastructure piece by piece into the cloud, exiting my restrictive environment, but then also giving me a newfound agility, and the ability to scale in new an exciting ways, that were very liberating. This experience was the birth of API Evangelist. After three years doing this, I needed a change, and knew that APIs was the space I wanted to be in, so I started a research blog to study the space--four years later I&rsquo;m still doing the research and publishing in real-time across the 60+ Github repos that make up API Evangelist. I evangelize APIs to not just spread the gospel of the technical benefits of APIs, I have remained passionate about APIs after four years by evangelizing the business, legal and cultural effects of an API-centric approach to business and government. The ability to break up operations into little bite size resources, that allow these resources to be used in their current context, but also allowing them to be used in entirely new ways is very appealing. Along with a more modular approach to business, comes a flexibility, agility, and transparency that will change culture at any company, and potentially an entire industry, or industries as we saw with Amazon. In my opinion business operations is about 30% technical, with the other 70% being about humans, and APIs deliver across 100% of that spectrum. As it did in 2006, the cloud is playing a transformative role in the world APIs in 2014, building on the concept that an API is a single, modular...[<a href="/2014/03/13/the-power-of-designing-and-deploying-api-driven-resources-in-containers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>13 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I am getting psyched going through the schedule lineup of 15 sessions at API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam. In planning the session outline, Steve, Vanessa and I listened to what the #APIStrat audience asked for after New York and San Francisco, which was more of the deep technical, as well as a balance of the business and politics of APIs.
I think our lineup delivers on this, which we've broken up into three tracks:
API Provider


Design and Development
Service Descriptions
Hypermedia APIs
API Marketing &amp; Developer Communities
Hardware and Internet of Things (IOT)

API By Industry


Media, Music and Audio APIs
Civic APIs
Enterprise APis
APIs in Financial Services
Community APIs

API Consumer

Discovery and Trust
Security and Testing
High Scalability
API Based App Development
Business Models

This lineup of sessions represent what we are seeing across the API space, with API design coming front and center, to hypermedia moving beyond an academic discussion and actually getting traction.  That is what API Strategy &amp; Practice is about, providing a venue to have discussions about the areas that are impacting the industry.
The best thing is, this is just the session lineup, we still have workshops, keynotes, fireside chats and panels.

			<p><em>13 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m adding a new grouping to my list of API management building blocks, called reciprocity. If you want to know what I mean by reciprocity check out my earlier post From ETL to API Reciprocity, Looking at 20 Service Providers. As I was working with Nimble the CRM system last night, and I was planning out some workflows associated with keeping contact data up to date, and noticed that Nimble provides access to Zapier automation tools directly from their interface, using an iframe. Providing access to API automation tools for your developers, and end-users, is an important piece of a larger reciprocity puzzle. As an API provider you should allow for developers and end-users to access, migrate, download, and orchestrate the flow of their own data. With this in mind I&rsquo;m adding four building blocks for reciprocity as part of my API management recommendations: Data Portability - Providing users with the ability to get data out of a system through a bulk download and via an API is essential to reciprocity existing. Along with other basic web literacy skills that every user should possess, every person should demand that any services they sign up for, should allow for data portability of all their resources. Terms of Service - The Terms of Service (TOS) is the central hub which makes the API economy work (or not work). TOS is where the protections for platform owners, developers and end-users exists. Restrictive TOS can suffocate the reciprocity of platform, while more sensible ones allow for the movement, and collaboration around resources that will make a platform thrive. oAuth - While not a perfect standard, oAuth is the best we have when it comes to providing an identify and access layer for API driven resource, one that allows for reciprocity to occur within a single API ecosystem, and between multiple ecosystems. oAuth gives the platform, developer and end-users a (potentially) equal role in who has access to API driven...[<a href="/2014/03/13/api-management-adding-reciprocity-building-blocks/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<h3><a href="/2014/03/12/api-talent-agencies/">API Talent Agencies</a></h3>
			<p><em>12 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>
I am watching Airpair and Workmob step up to meet the demand for developer talent in the API space, and can&rsquo;t help but selfishly want to see the same for API evangelism talent.
Along with the growth of the API space, the need for quality API developer talent has grown exponentially. Airpair and Workmob have both identified this (obvious) need, and will do well, if they can truly qualify, organize and direct talent to where it is needed across the space.
I would call Airpair and Workmob, API talent agencies, with a focus on development. I want to see the same emerge for API evangelism, advocacy, or whatever label you give it where you are from. The need for developers is greater, but there is a huge, unmet demand for evangelists. This is literally from an email I received today:
No one interesting is replying to our job postings, and I am wondering if you have any thoughts or suggestions on who the right person is and how to find them.
I see this throughout the week, and feel bad for many of the companies reaching out. An API evangelism talent agency wouldn&rsquo;t be your average marketing or PR agency. An API evangelism talent agency would have to be a tech savvy group, bringing not just outreach skills to the table, but some serious hacking chops.
If you have the desire (and resources) to start such an agency, let me know. I don&rsquo;t have the desire to run such an operation (or the resources), but I have the understanding of what the market needs, and can probably bring all the clients you'd need.

			<h3><a href="/2014/03/11/which-building-blocks-should-i-use-as-part-of-my-api-support-strategy/">Which Building Blocks Should I Use As Part Of My API Support Strategy</a></h3>
			<p><em>11 Mar 2014</em></p>
			<p>I wish I had more time to take many of the questions I get behind the scenes via email and publish as stories, but with an insane inbox I only can make time for some of the more relevant ones. I had one from a couple weeks ago that I just got around to responding to, which had to do with which support building blocks should an API provider use. This particular question comes from Jamie Parkins (@jamieparkins) from JustGiving: In your experience of documented APIs, when you come across the need for help, do you find the simple Google Group approach works or do you prefer the more ticket like approach that a Zendesk might offer (and possibly wrapped with some FAQs)? I only have a resource of 1 dev so have to pick my battles carefully but I can't help thinking I'll end up gaining time if I can help users solve their own problems or questions better from the start (i.e. A self service approach) Which building blocks you use in supporting your community is a balancing act based upon the amount of resources you have, the size of your community, and the types of users you have in your API community. Based upon what I've seen available at other APis, and the one's I've developed strategy for, you try and balance between self-service and direct support building blocks--with emphasis on self-service and asynchronous communication. Depending on your target audience, some consumers may be needier than others, and will not be accustom to self-service API approaches, coming from more of a sales and direct support culture. The goal within any API community is to steer as many of these users as you can towards a self and community supported model, but you want to make sure your company is actively present as well, engaging and supporting your developers&mdash;not absent and relying just on your community and self-service. There is no standard template...[<a href="/2014/03/11/which-building-blocks-should-i-use-as-part-of-my-api-support-strategy/">Read More</a>]</p>
