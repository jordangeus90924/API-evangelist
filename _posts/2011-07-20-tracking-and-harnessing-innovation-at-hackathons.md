{% include JB/setup %}<p>A lot of innovation occurs at hackathons.Seems like every hackathon I attend, there are discussion about how to better harness the talent available at these events, and develop a way to track what gets generated.The last hackathon I attended one of the ideas pitched was actually a web application that tracks what gets produced at hackathons.It would track the participants, and provide repositories for any code created.The application would provide access to ideas and projects from any participating event.</p>
