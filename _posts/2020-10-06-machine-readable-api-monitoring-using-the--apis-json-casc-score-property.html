These API resource centers are all powered by an <a href="http://apisyaml.org/">APIs.yaml</a> index, providing a machine readable core that is used to power each API resource center single page application. <a href="https://github.com/postman-toolboxes/covid-19/blob/master/_data/apis.yaml">Providing an index of a variety of COVID-19 and election related resources that powers the website</a>, but also can be used in other applications and systems to pull the OpenAPI, Postman Collections, and other artifacts that are being made available. One of the artifacts I am layering into the listing for each API is a <a href="https://www.api.expert/about/casc/">CASC score</a>, showing the uptime and availability across all of the resources being made available, helping me float the best APIs to the top of each API resource center.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">First, to make sure everyone is up to speed, <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> / <a href="http://apisyaml.org/">APIs.yaml</a> is a simple machine readable index for defining collections of APIs, and mapping out API operations. In this scenario I am using APIs.json as the core of an <a href="https://github.com/postman-toolboxes">API toolbox</a> that runs 100% on GitHub using Jekyll and Github Pages. In addition to indexing the documentation and Postman collections for each API, I am adding a property for a CASC Score which looks like this:</p>

<p class="p1">CASC Score is a way to understand the reliability and maturity of an API from my friends over at APIMetrics. I just took their data and created a machine readable APIs.yaml property that I could then use to display the CASC score for each of my COVID-19 and U.S. Election APIs. Using the property to sort and display the CASC score as part of each listing.</p>

<p class="p1">I needed a way to float the cream of each API resource center to the top, and the CASC score is one thing I consider when it comes to ranking each of the community contributed APIs. I am looking at other metrics, which I will also publish as APIs.yaml properties in the near future, but understanding the overall availability and reliability of the API from many different geographic regions over time is a pretty key indicator of whether an API is something I want to be recommending to developers.</p>
<p class="p1">Using the APIMetrics CASC score to helping me monitor and ultimately rank COVID-19 and U.S. Election APIs is just the beginning of this renewed work around APIs.json / APIs.yaml. I am working on a number of other human and machine readable properties for a variety of APIs. Helping me map out different layers of the API universe from COVID-19 to banking, and back again. If you have any questions about <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> / <a href="http://apisyaml.org/">APIs.yam</a>l head over to the website to learn more, and if you have any questions about the approach to delivering API resource centers then head over to <a href="https://github.com/postman-toolboxes">the GitHub repo for each of the repositories I have setup to power each of them</a>. Feel free to fork and play with any of the projects, or <a href="https://github.com/postman-toolboxes/home">visit the home repo for my API toolbox prototypes</a> to suggest new types of resource centers, or industry API catalogs.</p>\n
