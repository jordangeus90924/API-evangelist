It has been a while since I provided an update on the White House Digital Strategy.  I [monitor the progress of federal agencies participation programmatically][1], using JSON reports published by each agency at the agencies domain, /digitalstrategy.

After running the script today, I notice 20 federal agencies with active footprints.  There are about five more, but there are issues with the JSON version of their digital stratgies--I really want to focus on the programmatic value. So, across these 20 agencies I find 76 data API initiatives and 75 mobile API projects.

To bring you up to speed, there are two specific milestones in the [Digital Government Strategy][2] that specifically address API deployment:

  * **2.2 (Data) -** Make high-value data and content in at least existing two major customer-facing systems available through web APIs, apply metadata tagging and publish a plan to transition additional high-value systems
  * **7.2 (Mobile) -** Optimize at least two existing priority customer-facing services for mobile use and publish a plan for improving additional existing services  

To help shed light on where these progressive agencies are going with both their data and mobile intiatives I wanted to break them out into separate groups, for each agency.

###  2.2 Data

  * **Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT)** \- The Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT) provides longitudinal information on the education and employment of the college-educated U.S. science and engineering workforce, collected through three biennial surveys. These surveys capture trends in employment opportunities and salaries in various degree fields, and help federal researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of equal opportunity efforts.
  * **NSF Award Information** \- Information pertaining to NSF awards from 1959 through the present. Data includes principal investigator, awardee institution, NSF program and associated NSF organizations, award amount, award dates, award abstract, and publications and conference proceedings produced as a result of the research.
  * **NSF Research Grant Funding Rates** \- NSF funding rates for competitive research proposals by organizational unit. (Funding rates constitute the number of awards divided by the number of actions for a given year by organizational unit).
  * **Science **
