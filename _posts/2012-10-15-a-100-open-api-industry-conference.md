{% include JB/setup %}<p>When I set out to put on an API industry event in early 2012, I had grand visions of what it would be.Getting everyone together to discuss the best ideas, approaches the industry has to offer--while also discussing the critical topics such as open APIs, developer rights, monetization, etc.Fast forward 10 months, and the event is a reality, and even though it doesn’t exactly look like I imagined, it is damn close--with lots of amazing API discussions.After I announced the event has 60 speakers yesterday, I saw a tweet from Dave Winer (@davewiner): A conference about APIs with only speakers representing corporate APIs.Not one open API, so no interop.</p>
