{% include JB/setup %}<p>I would say the most common path to an API is from your companys database.This makes database to API connectors, tools and services a pretty valuable area of the API space.While there will always be high profile APIs dominating the tech blogosphere, most APIs will be launched quietly from small companies, by connecting them to various internal data sources.During API Strategy &amp; Practice, I met a new API service provider, called SlashDB, that focuses on just delivering APIs from your database.Once installed on any web server, SlashDB connects your internal databases and constructs a REST/HTTP web service, easily making database content accessible by URLs for getting, updating, inserting and deleting in a secure way.</p>
