<p>I&rsquo;m working extra hard when it comes to creating APIs across every  possible industry I can think of to help push my understanding of what  Postman collections are all about, and what is possible when putting  them to work. As I progress in my work I am quickly realizing how much  more versatile they are than OpenAPI definitions, allowing me to do  things I wanted to do with OpenAPI, but couldn&rsquo;t always figure out how  to make happen. Some of my dedicated readers might be getting sick of  hearing me talk about Postman collections, but since most of my readers  don&rsquo;t follow me regularly and rely weekly updates via email, or stumble  across my work as part of search engine exploration&mdash;I am going to  continue cranking out the stories! <a href="https://www.apievangelist.com/2019/09/24/enabler-mock-data-apis-alongside-other-apis-within-my-collections/">While working with an API collection for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) National Drug Code (NDC) API</a>,  I realized how Postman collections can help flatten some cumbersome API  queries I encounter while on-boarding with some of less than well  designed APIs out there.<br /><br />Many APIs are born out of database  backends, with very little design applied to the APIs externalizing the  database tables. Because of this most APIs offer Create, Read, Update,  and Delete (CRUD) functionality with the parameters reflecting the core  elements of a SQL Query. In these situations, database developers assume  that consumers will possess enough knowledge about the underlying  schema and requiring them to fill in the blanks of what fields should be  returned, and the details of the where clause determining which records  will be returned. Missing the point of what APIs are all about, and  workig harder to externalize the rich resources available within  database tables by providing intuitive paths, parameters, and other  elements that help any consumer understand what is possible. Database  developers who deploy APIs make these mistakes over and over again,  making many assumptions about what other developers will know and not  know, introducing unecessary friction for developers who are on-boarding  with their APIs.<br /><br /><a href="https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/ndc/example-api-queries/">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) National Drug Code (NDC) API</a> possesses a lot of rich data inside of it, but it does a pretty poor  job of documenting everything it is capable of its would-be consumers,  forcing you to do a significant amount of sleuthing before you can  really get at the entire surface of the API. The API provides a search  property which allows you to pass in a variety of properties including  brand_name:&rdquo;{brand name}&ldquo; and active_ingredients:&rdquo;{active ingredient}&ldquo;.  The approach isn&rsquo;t too uncommon, and if you have played with many  different APIs you can pretty quickly follow what is going on. Where the  challenge really comes in is knowing what the values are for brand name  and active ingredients&mdash;they don&rsquo;t document them for you. Providing two  hurdles for the average consumer when on boarding: 1) figuring out the  search properties, and 2) hunting down what the potential values can be.  Something not all developers or non-developers will be able to get  over.<br /><br /></p>
<p>To help abstract away this complexity I am developing a  Postman collection for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) National  Drug Code (NDC) API, possessing folders for each of the search  properties, with individual collections that are pre-populated values  for each parameter, so consumers do not have to learn the query language  or the potential values.</p>

<p>Here are a handful of examples of the queries  I&rsquo;ve populated:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brands</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Abilifu</li>
<li>Humira</li>
<li>Nexium </li>
<li>Crestor</li>
<li>Enbrel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Abiraterone Acetate</li>
<li>Acamprosate Calcium</li>
<li>Acitretin</li>
<li>Adapalene</li>
<li>Adefovir Dipivoxil</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All a potential consumer of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  National Drug Code (NDC) API has to do is click on the Run in Postman  Button, open the folder for brands or active pharmaceutical ingredients  and click on the option they want, and click &ldquo;send&rdquo;, and they get the  results. Eliminating the friction for API consumers using a Postman  collection. This is one of the features of Postman collection that you  can accomplish with an OpenAPI, but because of the historic use cases  for OpenAPI, it isn&rsquo;t something anyone has fully realized. For me, it is  a simple, yet potentially powerful feature that can significantly make  APIs more accessible to developers, and non-developers alike. This is  friction that could be easily addressed through some investment in APIs  design as well as API documentation, but for APIs that haven&rsquo;t done  this, Postman collections make for a pretty sweet plan B approach.<br /><br />This  is one of many killer features I&rsquo;m uncovering while playing around with  Postman, while cranking out Postman collections for many different  APIs. I am purposely playing around with many different types of APIs  because I want to see how I can push the boundaries of what Postman  collections are capable of doing, and transcend the technical aspects of  API integration, and make APIs more intuitive for consumers who aren&rsquo;t  necessarily up to speed on all the gotchas when it comes to API  integration. I have a LOT of work to do on this Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) National Drug Code (NDC) API collection before it  is ready for publishing. Once I have all the parameters and values added  to the collection I will share in another blog post. I&rsquo;m playing around  with dynamically generating the Postman collections from APIs I have  created for each of the lists of property values I&rsquo;ve gathered from  other data sources outside of the FDA developer area. I really don&rsquo;t  want to be manually adding each request to the collection, and automated  the creation of this type of Postman collection will pay dividends in  the future when I come across similar APIs that are missing their parts  and pieces, and haven&rsquo;t gone the distance with their API  design--allowing me to make some very useful APIs more accessible using  Postman collections.</p><p>I&rsquo;m working extra hard when it comes to creating APIs across every possible industry I can think of to help push my understanding of what Postman collections are all about, and what is possible when putting them to work.
