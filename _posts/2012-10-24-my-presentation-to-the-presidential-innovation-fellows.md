I spent two hours with a handful of the [Presidential Innovation Fellows][1] in Washington DC yesterday. They were some super savvy folks from a wide variety of agencies and backgrounds including education, energy and health.

During my two hours with them I walked through several areas of the API industry, from my perspective, including:

  * History of APIs
  * API Planning
