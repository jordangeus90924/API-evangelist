{% include JB/setup %}<p>Every couple weeks I get posts that really strike a chord with my audience, like Barack Obama Directs All Federal Agencies to Have an API, which has received 40K+ page views and 1000+ tweets.When it comes to sustained traffic numbers, two posts seem to really bring in eyeballs each and every week via organic searches: Open Building Blocks for an API Open Source API Billing and Traffic Control These posts are successful, not because of searches driven from a couple of hours on the home page of Reddit or Hacker News, these get page views because users are searching for open source API tools on the open Internet.Seeing these sustained numbers validates for me the need for an fully open-source set of tools for API deployment and management.While the top API management service providers like 3Scale, Apigee, Layer7, Mashery and SOA Software are enjoying growth in API adoption, to reach a million APIs and a truly healthy API industry, we need a solid open-source API platform that provides: RESTful Framework for Deployment and Management API Analytics and Metering API Service and Billing Management Ecosystem Building Blocks Like Documentation, Code Samples, etc.Discovery I know there are individual tools that deliver in some of these area, and this is what I am working to bring together via the API Evangelist tools section.</p>
