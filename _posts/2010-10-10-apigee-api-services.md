[Apigee][1] provides resources to help you understand best practices, avoid common pitfalls, develop your strategy, and learn to drive your developer community.

Apigee breaks down their product offerings into three tiers:

  * **Free** tools to learn test, and debug APIs. Analytics and rate limiting.
  * **Premium** tools for advanced rate limiting, key management and unlimited traffic plans.
  * **Enterprise** tools for API policy framework, scaling solution for both cloud and on-premise options.
[Apigee][1] seems dedicated a healthy and standards based approach to delivering your API ecosystem with pricing for every budget. Their three tiers of pricing allow you to get your API up and running without a huge budget, and grow as the demand for your API grows.
