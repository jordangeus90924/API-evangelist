<p><a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/05/introducing-twilio-functions.html">Twilio launched their Twilio Function this last week</a>, localizing serverless infrastructure for Twilio API consumers, when it comes to powering key functionality that Twilio brings to the table. This seems like a logical move for mature API providers, keeping in tune with shifts in how developers are integrating with APIs, and deploying their applications in a DevOps, continuous integration world.

<p>I could see other API providers following Twilio’s lead, jumping on the serverless bandwagon, and localizing compute within their API ecosystems. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/05/evolving-the-api-sdk-with-apimatic-dx-kits/">I can see this approach converging with other movements in the SDK space where service providers like APIMATIC are enabling the continuous deployment of SDKs, samples, and other scripts for API integration</a>. Allowing developers to quickly deploy integration scripts, in the programming language of choice–all baked into their existing API platform developer arrangement.

<p>It makes sense that some of these common approaches that are emerging across the API space like containerization, webhooks, serverless, evented and other real-time technologies make their way to being baked in, or at least augmenting existing API operations. I don’t think that every API provider should be following Twilio’s lead in every area, but they do provide a pretty interesting example consider when we think about where the API space might be headed–I find the most mature API providers are just as important to keep an eye on as much as each wave of startups.

<p>I’ll keep an eye on serverless being localized like this with other API providers. It seems like an opportunity for some provider, to develop a white label solution to help API providers deliver scripting, events, webhooks, and other emerging ways to orchestrate and integrate with APIs like Twilio is doing.
