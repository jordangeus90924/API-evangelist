        <span class="post-date">12 Jan 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://hyp3rl0cal.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-486" title="Tag-Cloud-HyperLocal" src="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Tag-Cloud-HyperLocal-300x143.png" alt="" width="300" height="143" align="right" /></a>I needed a way to tell the story of the&nbsp;<a title="CityGrid API" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid API</a>&nbsp;from the perspective of cities across the United States. &nbsp;The way I tell stories is through programming and hacking on APIs, so I needed a project that would allow me to hack on CityGrid&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a title="places" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API">places</a>,&nbsp;<a title="reviews" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Reviews+API">reviews</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="offers" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Offers+API">offers</a>&nbsp;as well as play with different ways of using the&nbsp;<a title="web, mobile and custom advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Ads+by+CityGrid">web, mobile and custom advertising</a>&nbsp;we offer.</p>
<p>So I created&nbsp;<a title="Hyp3rL0cal" href="http://hyp3rl0cal.com/">Hyp3rL0cal</a>, my playground for all things local. &nbsp;&nbsp;Hyp3rL0cal gives me a place to publish projects that I hack on using the CityGrid APIs, while also telling the story of what I build in real-time. &nbsp;You can find local applications I build in a variety of languages, complete with links to&nbsp;<a title="download and fork on Github" href="https://github.com/kinlane">download and fork on Github</a>, and even in some cases I publish Amazon Machine Images (AMI) with the code already loaded and ready to use.</p>
<p>As the API Evangelist at CityGrid I will be touring around the country attending hackathons and conferences, &nbsp;spreading the word about CityGrid, and interacting with developers in different cities. &nbsp;Each city I visit, I will launch a copy of my local directory prototype for that city, and publish to Hyp3rL0cal. &nbsp;This will allow me to see the quality of data available via CityGrid APIs for each city and community I visit.</p>
<p>I have added a&nbsp;<a title="blog to Hyp3rL0cal" href="http://hyp3rl0cal.com/blog/">blog to Hyp3rL0cal&nbsp;</a>where I will tell the story of my projects and travels around the country evangelizing about&nbsp;<a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygrid.com/">CityGrid</a>. &nbsp;Come back often, I hope this will be as much of a learning experience for you, as it is for me.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Jan 2012</span>
        <p>
     <a title="Hackathon" href="http://www.hackweekends.com" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-hackathon.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I just wrapped up the <a title="AT&amp;T Mobile Hackathon in Las Vegas" href="/events/att_mobile_app_hackathon_las_vegas.php">AT&amp;T Mobile App Hackathon in Las Vegas</a>. I had a great time hanging out with developers at the <a title="Palms Hotel" href="http://www.palms.com/">Palms Hotel</a>, and watching everyone compete for the 30K in prizes.
</p>
<p>
     My primary goal at these events is to get to know developers and hear what they have to say. I was fortunate to connect with one such developer, <a title="@Code4Ever" href="https://twitter.com/#!/code4ever">Ravi Singh</a> (<a title="@Code4Ever" href="https://twitter.com/#!/code4ever">@Code4Ever</a>), and he was so kind to share Ravi's Rules for Hackathon's:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <strong>#1:</strong> Use Eventbrite or Meetup to organize the event. Don't spin your own system because it is a waste of time. Eventbrite has it's own systems to market and get info about your event out.<br />
     <br />
     <strong>#2:</strong> Build a messaging network BEFORE the hackathon and register a hash for it. So many times developers leave the main area to work out their idea and miss critical information. Establish a simple back-end for all messages and let the attendees now and blast all important information about the even through it.<br />
     <br />
     <strong>#3:</strong> BEFORE the event setup a Google Spreadsheet so teams can register for the final presentations and send that out in the first mails. Do not wait to do or announce it late or in slides.<br />
     <br />
     <strong>#4:</strong> FOOD: Do not waste your money in lots of cheap items that are bad for the developer. Pounds of candy and jerky don't help your developers become more productive. There is a reason Google has 640 chef's cooking with organic and healthy foods. Instead of wasting your money on that stuff, find a good local cook or chef to make a hot lunch for the developers. Do not invest in Red Bull or 5hr energy or other food items that are actually bad and questionable for the health of the developers. This doesn't mean you serve tofu and fruit , but that you actively consider making food and providing drinks that are in the benefit of making the best apps.<br />
     <br />
     <strong>#5:</strong> Networking, test the network before and get a clause from the facility that states what the maximum they can support is and hold them to it. So many times the wifi connection is the blocking point for developers to make something great.<br />
     <br />
     <strong>#6:</strong> Judging and Rules. Make sure you post information about all of this upfront and be consistent and transparent. Do NOT have hidden or "soften" requirements when they are declared as hard ones. There is nothing more frustrating then when a team plays by the rules and gets beat by another team that hasn't. Create simple, clear and clean rules and enforce them. The more complicated the rules it is inversely proportional to the quality of the applications produced. Instead of making something great people make something to appease a set or rules. Always , Always , Always focus on making great software.<br />
     <br />
     <strong>#7:</strong> Vet all API's. If a particular requirement is to use an API , you must thoroughly examine the API ahead of time and if you have to hire someone to write a sample app for the intended app that you can distribute. There is nothing more negative then presenting a badly written or untested API to a potential group of developers , it actually creates negative market impressions.<br />
     <br />
     <strong>#8:</strong> Choose to make several smaller prizes instead of just 1 super prize. A lot of times the difference between #1 and #2 is negligible, reward the effort.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
     <strong>#9:</strong> Let the developers present to you and give them feedback if they request it. I have seen a few times where hackathon's ask for Video's or PowerPoint slides and don't let the developer present their idea in person. A developer that can not give a good presentation is still a million times better than the best powerpoint. Hacakthon's are usually compressed time events let the developers focus on making a great app and not waste time on presentation materials. Simple is always best. Ask the judges to keep notes and if they feel comfortable share with teams how they did. Give the developers a chance to get better. <br />
     <br />
     <strong>#10:</strong> Think about app display BEFORE the presentations. I have seen elmo's used, or projectors with VGA cables but the best setup is a an elmo or projector attached to video camera because it allows people to show their app on their computer or mobile device without a lot of fuss. You will need ideally 3 people in dedicated positions, A: Someone to host and take care of announcements and queueing up teams B: Someone near the display device adjusting and helping the nervous hackathoner's setup C: Someone to advise and keep the queued up teams in order. The video setup has maximum adaptability and the least amount of change over time between devices.<br />
     <br />
     <strong>#11:</strong> Give them time. I always find it weird that the developers spend 500 to 700 minutes creating something great and the presentations get limited to a 2 or 3 mins. Average hackathons have 30 teams , if each team was given an extra minute that is only about half an hour of extra judging time. If the developers have spent the time to make something they believe is great let them share it with you and the group and give them that extra minute.<br />
     <br />
     <strong>#12:</strong> Along the lines of being upfront there has been a new trend I have been seeing at hackathons that has me bewildered. One of the great things about this profession is that we are color and age blind. All we care about is if someone can make something great and not what they choose to do in their personal life or look like. The troubling trend that I have seen is discriminating against developers because of age. I have heard this a few times now where a judge has said outside the chambers that a particular developer was "too old" or they were looking for someone really young. This is insane. This should only be based on merit , who made the best app, nothing else.<br />

<p>
     Ravi is what I’d label as a hackathon veteran with over 30 hackathons under his belt, he has a good idea of what developers are looking for when attending hackathons.
</p>
<p>
     Thanks again <a title="@Code4Ever" href="https://twitter.com/#!/code4ever">Ravi</a>(<a title="@Code4Ever" href="https://twitter.com/#!/code4ever">@Code4Ever</a>) for sharing your thoughts, and I’d love to hear what other developers have to say about the event, now that we have all gotten some rest, and had time to reflect.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/01/10/definition-of-hack/">Definition of Hack</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2012</span>
        <p>

</p>
<p>
     I’m spending a lot of time traveling around the country going to <a title="hackathons" href="/events/">hackathons</a>. I find myself constantly explaining what the term hack means.
</p>
<p>
     I’m blown away by the number of people, even in the tech industry that still see hack as a negative term. At the <a title="AT&amp;T Hackathon" href="/events/att_mobile_app_hackathon_las_vegas.php">AT&amp;T hackathon in Las Vegas</a> , I encountered quite a few hardware folks in town for CES, attending the event. I was asked by one guy, “Are all these people trying to hack someone’s network?”.
</p>
<p>
     So, as part of my 2012 hackathon roadshow, I will take on trying to rebrand the term. Currently, these are the common definitions of the word hack:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>To cut or chop with repeated and irregular blows: hacked down the saplings
     </li>
     <li>To break up the surface of soil
     </li>
     <li>To alter a computer program
     </li>
     <li>To gain access to a computer file or network illegally or without authorization
     </li>
     <li>To cut or mutilate as if by hacking
     </li>
     <li>To cope with successfully
     </li>
     <li>To chop or cut something by hacking
     </li>
     <li>To write or refine computer programs skillfully
     </li>
     <li>To use one's skill in computer programming to gain illegal or unauthorized access to a file or network
     </li>
     <li>To cough roughly or harshly
     </li>
     <li>A rough, irregular cut made by hacking
     </li>
     <li>A tool, such as a hoe, used for hacking
     </li>
     <li>A blow made by hacking
     </li>
     <li>A rough, dry cough
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     The definition I’ve heard, and prefer is:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <strong><em>A quick and dirty programmatic solution to a problem.</em></strong>
</blockquote>
<p>
     I would like to solicit other definitions and feedback of how you’d like to see the term hack used widely in the media and Hollywood.

        <span class="post-date">08 Jan 2012</span>
        <p><a title="Twitter Hashtags" href="http://cmiroconsulting.com/2011/07/what-are-twitter-hashtags-and-how-to-use-them/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/twitter/Twitter-Hashtag.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons for throwing a <a title="hackathons" href="/events/">hackathon</a>, and what value you get out of a hackathon will vary depending on who you are.</p>
<p>As I explore the hackathon phenomenom in 2012, I&rsquo;m trying to track on what value hackathon organizers, API owners, mobile platforms, developers and other participants get out of hackathons.</p>
<p>I will be tracking on the different reasons people attend hackathons throughout the year, and share my findings, but here in January I know one thing for sure--hackthons are a marketing vehicle.  Whether you are the hackathon organizer, an API provider or developer you are depending on the event to market your organization, business, API or talent and skills as a developer.</p>
<p>In future posts I will write, more about the marketing effect of hackathons, but I wanted to talk about a common mistake I&rsquo;m seeing from hacakthon organizers--no Twitter hashtag for the event.</p>
<p>A Twitter hashtag is probably the most important marketing element of your hackathon.  It should be everywhere, on your site, print materials, slides...everywhere.  A hackathon organizer should be tweeting out every aspect of the event with the hashtag, before, during and after the event.</p>
<p>The hashtag will enable sponsors and other participating businesses to market themselves around the event.  It will also allow hackathon developers to showcase their ideas, skills and applications.</p>
<p>While researching hackathons I have to spend a lot of time tracking down the event hashtag, and many times I have to ask an event organizer to provide it, and often there isn&rsquo;t even one.</p>
<p>If your organizing an hackathon, make sure and establish a unique Twitter hashtag for event right away, and use it everywhere, everyone involved will benefit, and your event will be much more successful.</p>

     I look forward to meeting everyone at these events.  I will also work to establish some open office hours when I'm in each town, so I can maximize my networking with local developers from every city I visit.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/01/03/service-offered-by-local-social-mobile-api-providers/">Service Offered by Local, Social, Mobile API Providers</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">03 Jan 2012</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hyp3rl0cal/local-search-map-pin.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />To kick-off my role as <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> at <a title="CityGrid" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid</a>, I took a <a title="quick walk through of locations and places data APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/12/22/quick-walk-through-the-world-of-location-&amp;-places-apis/">quick walk through the world of location and places API</a>.<p></p>
The <a title="CityGrid API" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid API</a> centers around places API which provides rich local business data via a RESTful API. So getting familiar with other location and places API is critical to my role.<p></p>
While going through each of these APIs in the space I flushed out what I'd consider the high levels areas that these APIs offer. This list is a work in progress, with a goal in helping see the industry, and potentially identify where players are leading the industry, and where there are gaps.<p></p>
Of course it all starts with places information. Rich content about businesses and other geographic points of interest. CityGrid, Google, Yahoo, Bing and other players like Foursquare, SimpleGeo, InfoChimps and Factual all bring places data to the table.<p></p>
CityGrid and Foursquare also bring merchant APIs to the game, allowing businesses to manage their profile data as well as how it gets syndicated across many networks.<p></p>
Along with places data there are various geo related services that are offered across these APIs:
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hyp3rl0cal/geofencing.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a title="Geocoding" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding">GeoCoding</a></li>
	<li>Directions</li>
	<li>Distance</li>
	<li>Elevation</li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence">Geofencing</a></li>
</ul>
The next area I'm grouping location services under would be other content directly related to specific places, pulled through APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Reviews</li>
	<li>Offers</li>
	<li>Images</li>
	<li>Videos</li>
	<li>Menus</li>
	<li>Editorials</li>
</ul>
After location and business related content I'd say there is a growing pool of related content that may not be directly associated with a business or location, but provide context, and augment places data making it more meaningful to users:
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hyp3rl0cal/neighborhood-city-center.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Weather</li>
	<li>Demographics</li>
	<li>Wikipedia</li>
	<li>Neighborhood</li>
	<li>Tagging</li>
</ul>
That isn't a complete list of contextual places content, but a couple of quick ones I found. I will explore this area more later.<p></p>
After content I'm seeing very distinct actions that users can take around location and places data. Again, I'm sure there are more of these, but here is a short list of location actions:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Check-In</li>
	<li>Push Notifications</li>
	<li>Recommendations</li>
</ul>
You can't talk about location data without bringing in mapping. Google Maps is the most well known mapping API, but there are several providers that have JavaScript and Image based location mapping that developers can use in their web and mobile applications.<p></p>
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hyp3rl0cal/urban-spoon-iphone.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Next I broke out a group of location specific services, that provide location tools for developers that provide current location of users as well as tools for recording the history of users. There are also robust tools for doing look-ups of location based upon IP address, longitude and latitude and physical address.<p></p>
While doing the review of location and places APIs I also notice mobile specific tools offered by a few of the provider like mobile network probe for identifying network quality, and mobile specific SDKs, making sure mobile developers can take maximize their usage of services.<p></p>
Last but not least are a handful of social tools that bring the social to local, mobile, social. Mostly these are hooks into Twitter and Facebook friend networks, but some bring their own social networks to the table, such as Foursquare.<p></p>
This is just my first draft of the different areas of APIs, tools and services provide by location and places API providers. Its by no means a complete listing, and is meant to give me a start in understanding and organizing the local, mobile, social API space.<p></p>
If you know of any areas I'm missing and should be considering, please <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/contact/">let me know</a>.

<p>
     I expected Apple related API stories to be big, but the other topics on here like endpoint planning, transit APIs, open building blocks, RESTful business architecture and a flood of APIs were a surprise.
</p>
<p>
     Overall it shows me that applying APIs and RESTful concepts to business in specific industries can really get people talking.
</p>
<p>
     A few of these posts were written while I was doing deep dives into government, water and transit industries and how APIs are changing the landscape.
</p>
<p>
     I hope to do many of these deep industry dives in 2012.

     One of the most important fronts of API development is Government.  All of us API and data guys have all been screaming for city, county, state and federal government to open up their data via APIs for years now. 
</p>
<p>
     In 2011 I would say many government officials listened, and opened up almost <a title="100 government APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?apicat=Government&amp;maxdays=360">100 government APIs, according to ProgrammableWeb</a>:

<p>
     In 2012 it will be critical for more government agencies to open up, but also I think its time for us developers to step up and start making sense of this data and how our government operates.
</p>
<p>
     We are getting what we wanted, now how do we deliver on the promise of open government APIs?

So far its a great read. Very thought provoking stuff.
</p>
<p>
     I just read this passage on how the first dictionary transformed the way we were able to think about, understand and re-use words:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>...the meaning of words come from other words. It implies that all words come from other words, taken together, form an interlocking structure: interlocking, because all the words are defined in terms of other words. This could never have been an issue in an oral culture, where language was barely visible. Only when printing---and the diction---put the language into separate relief, as an object to be scrutinized, could anyone develop a sense of a word meaning as interdependent and even circular. Words had to be considered as words, representing other words, apart from things.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     For the first time words stood on their own, apart from the stories and poems that contained them. The first dictionaries set into motion, much of what we take for granite today with writing and communicating.
</p>
<p>
     It made me think of what APIs are doing for business information and resources. APIs decouple them, making them independent of their original intended form and meaning.  Allowing them be accessed, distributed, re-used and transformed into new ways never even conceived by its original source or creator.
</p>
<p>
     The content of an existing travel book could become an interactive application, using Google Earth, Wikipedia and other APIs allowing someone to travel the global on their iPad without leaving their home.  
</p>
<p>
     The <a title="CityGrid API" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com">CityGrid API</a> I evangelize for offers business and places data for cities across the country, with a web and mobile adveritising network.  This single resource can mean many things to different people, it could be a restaurant directory in Seattle or a medical assistance guide in Philadelphia.  
</p>
<p>
     APIs have a lot of potential in freeing up many of the business resources, media and content we use everyday and allow for them to be used in new ways.   Creating entirely new ways of doing business, using many of the same business information and resources we've been using for years.

</p>
<p>
     As 2011 comes to an end, I’d like to take another look at what I learned about the <a title="API Service Provider" href="/serviceproviders/">API management service provider</a> space in 2011. I started the year engaging 3Scale, Apigee and Mashery, trying to find a platform to build the Mimeo Connect API platform on. Then spent the entire year getting to know each of the API management service providers, and the products they offer. At the end of the year, we are <a title="discussing the relevancy of API service providers" href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups/How-can-Infrastructure-API-vendors-4084799.S.86250844?qid=c824d4cb-887b-41d2-81c1-1170eff1c6d8&amp;trk=group_most_popular-0-b-ttl&amp;goback=%2Egde_4084799_member_86250844%2Egmp_4084799">discussing the relevancy of API service providers</a>, so I think a year-end API service provider post is due.
</p>
<p>
     <strong>The First Dimension<br /></strong>To make sense of the API management space, I’m looking at it in five separate dimensions. As of December 2011, I would set the first dimension and primary API management playing field as:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="3Scale" href="/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Alcatel Lucent" href="/serviceproviders/alcatel_lucent.php">Alcatel Lucent</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Apigee" href="/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="SOA Software" href="http://www.soa.com/">SOA Software</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Intel" href="/serviceproviders/intel.php">Intel</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Layer 7 Technologies" href="/serviceproviders/layer_7_technologies.php">Layer 7 Technologies</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Mashery" href="/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Vordel" href="/serviceproviders/vordel.php">Vordel</a></strong>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     These companies are going to provide a gateway, proxy or a connector for your APIs either on-premise or in the cloud.
</p>
<p>
     Then through that gateway, proxy, connector they will offer a variety of services to secure, translate, throttle, cache, distribute and scale your APIs as you need.
</p>
<p>
     Some of these companies will also provide you with a way to manage usage, billing, reporting and legal for the users, partners and developers who will be consuming your API.
</p>
<p>
     These companies will also bring a whole bunch of expertise to the table, that your company can tap while building your API strategy. Some will even help you market your API to developers online and at events.
</p>
<p>
     One thing to know about these API management service providers is, well...they are API management service providers. To my knowledge they don’t actually deploy your API for you, they help you build a strategy, and manage the API. But you still need to rely on other tools and in-house resources to deliver your API.
</p>
<p>
     A common Google search or in-person query I get is: Apigee vs. Mashery, 3Scale vs. Apigee and Layer7 vs. Apigee, etc 
</p>
<p>
     After all my research, and talking to all the API management service providers--I don’t have a straight answer. My response is...visit each of their sites, choose the ones that speak to you, and call them. They each have a unique style to API management, and its healthy to get acquainted with each of their approaches, and find one that fits your companies objectives.
</p>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Second-Dimension-Data-API-Management.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     <strong>The Second Dimension</strong><br />
     Beyond the primary players I’d say there are a group of data driven API service providers that bring a different set of tools and expertise:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="WebServius" href="/serviceproviders/webservius.php">WebServius</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Kasabi" href="/serviceproviders/kasabi.php">Kasabi</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="InfoChimps" href="/serviceproviders/infochimps.php">InfoChimps</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Socrata" href="/serviceproviders/socrata.php">Socrata</a></strong>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Data API management platforms are focusing on bringing data to life as APIs. These companies are either acquiring their own data-sets to deliver as APIs, doing it as a service for companies or providing you with tools to do it yourself. Whatever the scenario is, its about building access and delivery networks, for data, using APIs.
</p>
<p>
     <strong>The Third Dimension</strong><br />
     There is also a wave of new breed API management platforms, each with a slightly different vision of where the space should go:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Apiary.io" href="/serviceproviders/apiary.io.php">Apiary.io</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Atmosphere" href="/serviceproviders/atmosphere.php">Atmosphere</a></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Mashape" href="/serviceproviders/mashape.php">Mashape</a></strong>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     These new players are bringing community and social to API management, along with new ways to describe, test, manage and share APIs. This new wave has a chance to change the conversation around APIs dramatically in 2012.
</p>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Third-Dimension-New-Wave-API-Management.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     <strong>The Fourth Dimension</strong><br />
     Beyond these companies directly offering API management services, there is always the bootstrap model. Wordpress, Github, Google Groups, Twitter and some custom coding on an Amazon EC2 instance can make for a pretty fine API and supporting area.
</p>
<p>
     I’ve identified a whole range of <a title="API Building Blocks on API Evangelist" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">API building blocks on API Evangelist</a>, and I’m always working to <a title="define the tools a DIY API owner can use" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/apitools/">define tools that the DIY API owner can use</a> to deploy and manage their API. This is where you’ll find the frameworks you’ll need to deploy an API, forum, blog, code samples, repositories, etc.
</p>
<p>
     However there are some key building blocks missing in this approach. There are no clear tools for API key management, rate limiting, translation, transformation, metrics, billing, reporting, and other areas that API management service providers are capitalizing on. <a title="on the road to the commodization of certain API management" href="http://www.diversity.net.nz/finding-relevance-in-a-commoditized-world-apis-and-infrastructure-2/2011/12/21/">On the road to the commodization of certain API management services</a>, we need some more open-source players to jump in the game. Or maybe some existing player could open-source their tools?
</p>
<p>
     <strong>The Fifth Dimension</strong><br />
     So we have the primary, data and next wave of API management service providers as well as the DIY approach to API management. I’d have to say there is a fifth dimension of this space, and that’s Google.
</p>
<p>
     Much like Amazon has done with EC2, S3 and RDS, Google is in a great position to lead the industry by example, with their standardized approach to Google API delivery and management with <a title="Google Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google Console</a>, <a title="Google Discovery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">Google Discovery</a>, <a title="Google Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/google-api-explorer/">Google Explorer</a> and Google Analytics.
</p>
<p>
     In my post, the <a title="Business of Google APIs" href="/2011/12/21/business-of-google-apis-2011/">Business of Google APIs 2011</a>, I introduce the idea of Google opening up its API management platform to other API owners. My thought is, that Google is in a good position to open up API management infrastructure via the Google Apps Platform, allowing any company to easily deploy an API and enable discover, exploration and management via the tools Google rolled out in 2011 for its own APIs.
</p>
<p>
     In my opinion each of the <strong>five API management dimensions</strong> I’ve laid out will have significant roles they could play in 2012:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>First Dimension</strong> - The primary API management players will fuel growth of API adoption in 2012 from the small business to the enterprise.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Second Dimension</strong> - Data API management providers will ensure the massive amounts of data we have, and are creating daily will be accessible, have delivery networks and marketplaces using APIs.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Third Dimension</strong> - A new wave of social, agile and community driven approaches to API management whill change the game and create entirely new ways to deploy, deliver, manage and consume what we know as APIs.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Fourth Dimension</strong> - DIY API management will fuel growth and innovation in the space, but without the entry of more open-source API building block players the whole industry will suffer.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Fifth Dimension</strong> - Google posses all the tools for deploying, discovering, exploring, managing and consuming APIs, will they share with the world, or keep it for themselves?
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I may actually throw in a <strong>Sixth Dimension</strong> for the API management space in 2012, <strong><a title="Content APIs" href="http://seabourneinc.com/projects/contentapi/">Content APIs</a></strong>. This is based on what I’ve <a title="seen in the space around delivering content APIs" href="/2011/12/20/the-fcc-lanches-api-curation-platform-called-myfcc/">seen in the space around deployment of Content APIs</a> for Worpdress, Drupal and other CMS platforms. Essentially turning every site into an API.
</p>
<p>
     Any of these six dimensions of API management could change the API conversation in 2012. The only thing I can predict 100%, is 2012 is definitely going to be a fun ride, based upon what i’ve seen in 2011--we are poised for some serious growth.

<p>I took a walk through what I am calling the locations and places API landscape today. Most of these APIs I&rsquo;m familiar with, but as the <a title="CityGrid API Evangelist" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/citygrid-api-evangelist/">CityGrid API Evangelist</a>, I&rsquo;m getting an opportunity to immerse myself into this new local, social mobile world.</p>
<p>As I immerse myself in this semi-new world I want to share my findings with everyone else. &nbsp;If you have any suggestions make sure and let me know in comments below.</p>
<p>First I started with&nbsp;<strong><a title="CityGrid APIs" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid APIs</a></strong>, which provide several key location and places APIs:<br /><a href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/citygrid/citygrid_logo_200.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>The Places API</strong>&nbsp;- Provides functionality for information on local businesses, including search, detail, user content submission, and predictive text</li>
<li><strong>The Offers API</strong>&nbsp;- Provides coupons and special offers from businesses based on geography and category</li>
<li><strong>The Reviews API</strong>&nbsp;- Provides access to customer reviews for businesses selected by id or by geography or category</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I wanted to see what Google was doing, and of course started with the&nbsp;<strong><a title="Google Maps API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html">Google Maps APIs</a>:</strong><br /><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-Maps-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Maps JavaScript API</strong>&nbsp;- The Google Maps Javascript API lets you embed Google Maps in your own web pages</li>
<li><strong>Maps Image API</strong>&nbsp;- The Google Maps Image APIs make it easy to embed a static Google Maps image or Street View panorama into your web page, with no need for JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with Google Maps they offer a set of&nbsp;<strong><a title="Geo Web Services" href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/">Geo Web Services</a></strong>&nbsp;that contain several location and places based APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Directions API</strong>&nbsp;- The Google Directions API is a service that calculates directions between locations</li>
<li><strong>Distance Matrix API</strong>&nbsp;- The Google Distance Matrix API is a service that provides travel distance and time for a matrix of origins and destinations.</li>
<li><strong>Elevation API</strong>&nbsp;- The Google Elevation API provides you an interface to query locations on the earth for elevation data.</li>
<li><strong>Geocoding API</strong>&nbsp;- Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates</li>
<li><strong>Places API</strong>&nbsp;- The Google Places API is a service that returns information about places, defined as establishments, geographic locations, or prominent points of interest</li>
</ul>
<p>Already with&nbsp;<strong><a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygrid.com/">CityGrid</a></strong>&nbsp;and Google I&rsquo;m seeing that the type of location and places services, really start to get complicated and diverse. With&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/latitude/" target="_blank">Google Latitude</a></strong>&nbsp;I start separating the location from the place, with what are two location specific APIs:<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/latitude/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google_latitude_icon.jpeg" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Curent locations</strong>&nbsp;- Represents the user's most recent known location</li>
<li><strong>Location history</strong>&nbsp;- Represents the list of all recorded user locations</li>
</ul>
<p>After Google I have to look at another big player,&nbsp;<strong><a title="Yahoo" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/everything.html?category=location&amp;view=detail">Yahoo</a></strong>. Yahoo has several location based services:<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/everything.html?category=location&amp;view=detail"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/yahoo/yahoo_geo_logo_med.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Fire Eagle</strong>&nbsp;- Fire Eagle is a service designed to build and use location-aware applications and services</li>
<li><strong>GeoPlanet</strong>&nbsp;- Yahoo! GeoPlanet is a resource for managing all geo-permanent named places on Earth</li>
<li><strong>Local</strong>&nbsp;<strong>API</strong>&nbsp;- Provides a database of information including business address and phone, category, rating, distance, URL, and traffic alerts</li>
<li><strong>Maps</strong>&nbsp;- Provides interactive maps with driving directions and traffic information</li>
<li><strong>PlaceFinder</strong>&nbsp;- Converts street addresses or place names into geographic coordinates (and vice versa)</li>
<li><strong>Placemaker</strong>&nbsp;- Identifies places mentioned in text, disambiguating them and returning unique identifiers</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally after taking a look at Yahoo I have to go see what&nbsp;<strong><a title="Microsoft" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701715.aspx">Microsoft</a></strong>&nbsp;is up to in the space:<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701715.aspx"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/bing/Bing_Maps_blue_200.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Bing Maps API</strong>- The API that power Bing Maps, an online mapping service that enables users to search, discover, explore, plan, and share information about specific locations</li>
<li><strong>Bings Maps Location API</strong>&nbsp;- Use the Locations API to get location information (<em>I love this description!</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>After looking at what local and mobile offerings the big players Google, Yahoo and Microsoft had I started looking at less search and mapping based services to more carrier based location and place services. I started with&nbsp;<strong><a title="Verizon" href="http://developer.verizon.com/content/vdc/en/verizon-tools-apis/verizon_apis.html">Verizon</a></strong>, who has a single location API:<a href="http://developer.verizon.com/content/vdc/en/verizon-tools-apis/verizon_apis.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/verizon/verizon-logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>LBS Network API</strong>&nbsp;- The Verizon LBS API allows you to use the user's location to deliver specific services</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a title="Sprint" href="http://developer.sprint.com/site/global/home/p_home.jsp">Sprint</a></strong>&nbsp;brings three location APIs to the table:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Geofence</strong>&nbsp;- Provides virtual perimeter services</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong>&nbsp;- Determines the location of a Sprint CDMA Device</li>
<li><strong>Presence</strong>&nbsp;- Determines if a device is present on the Sprint CDMA&nbsp;network</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a title="AT&amp;T" href="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/telcos/att-logo.jpg">AT&amp;T</a></strong>&nbsp;has a LBS API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Terminal Location</strong>&nbsp;- Set of Location-based Services (LBS)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a title="Deutsche Telekom" href="http://www.developergarden.com/startseite">Deutsche Telekom</a></strong>&nbsp;has one location API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>IP Location API</strong>&nbsp;- Locate Internet users with their IP addresses</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a title="Ericsson Labs" href="https://labs.ericsson.com/apis/">Ericsson Labs</a></strong>&nbsp;provides a developer community around a full suite of APIS:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>3D Landscape API</strong>&nbsp;- 3D Landscape API for integration o realistic 3D MAPS</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Location API</strong>&nbsp;- Allows the use a mobile phone user's current CELL-ID to obtain their geographical location</li>
<li><strong>Network Probe API</strong>&nbsp;- Provides services measure certain characteristics of network IP connectivity, firewalls and Network Address Translators</li>
<li><strong>Web Location API</strong>&nbsp;- Provides location data from a mobile phone using the positioning systems of mobile operators</li>
<li><strong>Web Maps API</strong>&nbsp;- Provides dynamic maps for application integration</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a title="France Telecom" href="http://www.orangepartner.com/">France Telecom</a></strong>&nbsp;also has a location API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Location API</strong>&nbsp;- Allows applications to get geographic coordinates of a given Orange France mobile phone or a fleet</li>
</ul>
<p>Makes sense for every carrier to also provide developers with a set of location services, as they don&rsquo;t want to just be dumb pipes. They want to be an integrated player in their own customers handset usage.</p>
<p>Next I start looking to put the social in local, mobile, social. Where else to you start but Facebook, which has two location based objects as part of the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/" target="_blank">Graph API</a>:</strong><a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/facebook_logo-icon.png" alt="" width="80" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Checkin</strong>&nbsp;- A checkin represents a single visit by a user to a location</li>
<li><strong>Places</strong>&nbsp;- A search option before initiating a checkin, returning name and location information from Graph API</li>
</ul>
<p>I thought I'd consider Twitter next. &nbsp;They have&nbsp;<a title="Places &amp; Geo" href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api#places-geo">Places and Geo</a>&nbsp;methods, but it really doesn't seem like its going anywhere, and a really small portion of tweets have geo info recorded. &nbsp;I will consider in the future if I see action around it.</p>
<p>In the category of location based social network I was investigating&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/" target="_blank">Foursquare</a></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a title="Gowalla" href="http://gowalla.com/">Gowalla</a></strong>, but with the recent Facebook acquisition of Gowalla I think I will only look at&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/" target="_blank">Foursquare</a></strong>. Foursquare offers access to four different APIs:</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/foursquare/foursquare_logo_200.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Core API</strong>&nbsp;- Users, Venues, Venue Groups, Checkins, Tips, Lists, Photos, Specials, Campaigns, Events</li>
<li><strong>Real-time API</strong>&nbsp;- Notifies venue managers when users check in to their venues, and our user push API notifies developers when their users check in anywhere</li>
<li><strong>Merchant Platform</strong>&nbsp;- The Merchant Platform allows developers to write applications that help registered venue owners manage their foursquare presence and specials</li>
<li><strong>Venues Platform</strong>&nbsp;- The Venues Platform allows developers to search for places and access a wealth of information about them, including addresses, popularity, tips, and photos</li>
</ul>
<p>After Foursquare you leave social, getting into the places data world, with popular player&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://simplegeo.com/" target="_blank">SimpleGeo</a></strong>. Similar to Gowalla I was going to overlook SimpleGeo, with their recent&nbsp;<a title="acquisition by Urban Airship" href="http://blog.simplegeo.com/2011/10/31/taking-our-relationship-with-urban-airship-to-a-cruising-altitude/">acquisition by Urban Airship</a>, but I think SimpleGeo is still an important enough of a player, that we should still consider them in the game. SimpleGeo has four distinct web services for location and places:<a href="https://simplegeo.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hyp3rl0cal/simplegeo/simplegeo_logo_200.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>SimpleGeo Storage</strong>&nbsp;- Storage of data in SimpleGeo system</li>
<li><strong>SimpleGeo Features</strong>&nbsp;- Features in SimpleGeo represent real-world places such as businesses, regions, or US states</li>
<li><strong>SimpleGeo Context</strong>&nbsp;- Provides relevant contextual information such as weather, demographics, or neighborhood data for a specific location</li>
<li><strong>SimpleGeo Places</strong>&nbsp;- Businesses and points of interest</li>
</ul>
<p>In the pure places data game I&rsquo;d put&nbsp;<strong><a href="ttps://www.factual.com" target="_blank">Factual</a></strong>&nbsp;in the same category as SimpleGeo. Factual has seven location and places APIs:<a href="ttps://www.factual.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/factual/factual-logo.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Places Category API</strong>&nbsp;- Taxonomy to classify entities in the various Factual point-of-interest (POI) datasets</li>
<li><strong>Places Crossref&nbsp;API</strong>&nbsp;- URLs for pages that mention a specific business or point of interest or vice versa</li>
<li><strong>Places Crosswalk&nbsp;API</strong>&nbsp;- Maps third-party (Yelp, Foursquare, etc.) identifiers for businesses or points of interest to each other where each ID represents the same place</li>
<li><strong>Places Global Database&nbsp;API</strong>&nbsp;- 55 million entities in 47 countries</li>
<li><strong>Places Global Place Attributes&nbsp;API</strong>&nbsp;- The latest schema for the global places dataset</li>
<li><strong>Places Resolve&nbsp;API</strong>&nbsp;- Makes partial records complete, matches one entity against another, and assists in de-duping and normalizing datasets</li>
<li><strong>Places Restaurants&nbsp;API</strong>&nbsp;- Core places attributes in addition to 43 extended attributes on 800,000+ restaurants, bars, and casual eateries including datatypes such as cuisine, ratings, hours of operations, and price</li>
</ul>
<p>Tied with SimpleGeo and Factual is&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.infochimps.com/apis/geo" target="_blank">InfoChimps</a></strong>. InfoChimps is a data marketplace player with some very strong location and places services:<a href="http://www.infochimps.com/apis/geo" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/infochimps/infochimps-logo.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Wikipedia Articles</strong>&nbsp;- Correlate Wikipedia articles with geographic locations</li>
<li><strong>Business Places by Locationary</strong>&nbsp;- The Business Places by Locationary API delivers quality business information based on your geographically defined query</li>
<li><strong>Foursquare Places</strong>&nbsp;- The Foursquare Places API delivers uniquely rich information about venues, worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Geonames Places</strong>&nbsp;- The Geonames Places API locates all places within a specified area. Places are any geographic points that can be named</li>
<li><strong>NCDC Weather</strong>&nbsp;- The NCDC Weather API provides detailed weather data based on your geographically defined query. Weather data points for your query may include dew point, precipitation, snow depth, temperature, visibility, and wind speed details</li>
<li><strong>American Community Survey (Topline)</strong>&nbsp;- The 2009 American Community Survey (ACS) Topline API provides basic demographic data based on your geographically defined query</li>
<li><strong>American Community Survey (Drilldown)</strong>- The 2009 American Community Survey (ACS) Drilldown API provides detailed demographic data based on your geographically defined query</li>
<li><strong>Core Geographic Regions</strong>&nbsp;- The Core Geographic Regions API delivers detailed geodata for any geographically defined query, worldwide</li>
<li><strong>Zillow Neighborhoods</strong>&nbsp;- Zillow Neighborhoods retrieves geo data pertaining to neighborhoods within defined geometric parameters</li>
<li><strong>Digital Element IP Intelligence Demographics</strong>&nbsp;- A geolocation API for all your demographics needs. Search by IP address to return data about a geographical area, including number of households, gender, age groups and language</li>
<li><strong>Digital Element IP Intelligence Domains</strong>&nbsp;- A reverse IP lookup API with 5 fields of search results, all customized to your IP query. Search by IP address to return data about the domain, company, ISP, NAICS industry code and proxy type for an IP</li>
<li><strong>Digital Element IP Intelligence Geolocation</strong>&nbsp;- A geolocation API with 20 fields of search results, all customized to your IP query. Search by IP address to return data about a geographical area, including country, region, city, internet connection speed</li>
<li><strong>Geocoding API</strong>&nbsp;- The Geocoding API is a powerful and useful tool that provides location information for any given address in the United States. Geocoding is a process that assigns geographic data (ie, latitude and longitude) to an address</li>
<li><strong>Latitude Longitude and Zip Code Conversions -</strong>&nbsp;This API returns approximated latitude/longitude centroids for a given zip code, along with the relative city, state, and county</li>
</ul>
<p>Then moving out of pure data players&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview" target="_blank">Yelp</a></strong>&nbsp;has always been centered around reviews, and more recently, with version 2.0 of their API moved to be centered around the businesses. Yelp has two places APIs:<a href="http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/yelp/Yelp_Logo_200.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Search API</strong>&nbsp;- Searches for Businesses</li>
<li><strong>Business API</strong>&nbsp;- Returns full details of businesses</li>
</ul>
<p>Another player in the space is&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://fwix.com/" target="_blank">Fwix</a></strong>. Fwix has a different approach to places, trying to geotag the web. Fwix offers six places and location APIs:<a href="http://fwix.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/hyp3rl0cal/fwix/fwix_logo_300.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Geotagger API</strong>&nbsp;- Returns places geotagged to a given web page</li>
<li><strong>Content API</strong>&nbsp;- Returns geotagged content in or near a location</li>
<li><strong>Categories API</strong>&nbsp;- Returns the list of canonical place categories</li>
<li><strong>Location API</strong>&nbsp;- Returns geographic data for a latitude/longitude point</li>
<li><strong>Places API</strong>&nbsp;- Return, Submit and Delete a list of businesses for a given location</li>
</ul>
<p>After Fwix I found a couple of other mapping, location and places data services:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="PushPin" href="http://www.pushpin.com/api/1.3/docs/rest/latlng.html">PushPin</a></strong>&nbsp;- The Pushpin Identify Service is a REST service that takes geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) and resolves them to named locations on the earth</li>
<li><strong><a title="43 Places" href="http://www.43places.com/about/view/web_service_api">43 Places</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>Allows users build 43 Places by adding places, asking questions, giving travel advice, uploading pictures of their favorite places and writing stories about the places they've been and want to go.</li>
<li><strong><a title="MaxMind" href="http://www.maxmind.com/app/city">MaxMind GeoIP&reg; City Database</a>&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;Determine country, state/region, city, US postal code, US area code, metro code, latitude, and longitude information for IP addresses worldwide.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Compass" href="http://compass.webservius.com/documentation.htm">Compass</a>&nbsp;-</strong>&nbsp;Allows access to a database of 16 million business establishments in the USA.</li>
</ul>
<p>These providers either didn&rsquo;t have clear market share or started deviating into other parallel universes of content and services to location and places, so I'm going to stop here.</p>
<p>These 17 places and location API providers are a lot to process. &nbsp;I want to spend some time getting a handle on the types of services they offer, before I dive into the peripheral services as well as the players that have less market share. But in my style, I'll keep posting my findings as I pull them together.</p>

<p><a title="ProgrammableWeb says Google has 94 APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?company=Google">ProgrammableWeb says Google has 94 APIs</a>.  I roughly count about <a href="http://code.google.com/more/">75 going through Google Code</a>.  I&rsquo;m more concerned with public web APIs, and Google has Android, Chrome and other non-web APIs, so its hard to tell.</p>
<p>In any case I would consider Google to the largest public web API owner around.  I don&rsquo;t think any other single provider, owns the number of, as well as size of public APIs, that Google does.  As with any leading API providers I think there is a lot to learn in studying their approach to API deployment and management.</p>
<p>With this in mind I wanted to take a look at the Business of Google APIs in 2011 as one of my year-end, API reflection posts.  I think there are some important lessons to be learned from the work Google did over 2011, to get their API business in order.</p>
<p>Google was already setting the theme for 2011, with the <a title="launch of Google Console in 2010" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2010/11/introducing-google-apis-console-and-our.html">launch of Google Console in November 2010</a>.  The <a title="Google API Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/">Google API Console</a> helps developers manage their Google API usage across all of thier sites and apps.  It was clear, Google was not just looking for a way to get a handle on how they deploy and manage large numbers of APIs, they were acknowledging developers needed a way as well.</p>

<p><a title="Google API Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google API Console</a> centralized how developers managed the Google APIs they used, traffic generated via these APIs, introduced billing management for some APIs, and provided developers with project and team building tools. &nbsp;Google supports 30 APIs inside of the API Console now.</p>
<p>In 2011 Google also worked to make their <a title="Google APIs more discoverable" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/05/google-apis-discovery-service-one-api.html">APIs more discoverable for developers</a> with the launch <a title="Google API Discovery Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/">Google API Discovery Service</a>.  The <a title="Google API Discover Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">Google API Discovery Service</a> provides a set of web APIs for discovering metadata across Google APIs by delivering a JSON-based API that provides a directory of supported Google APIs, and a machine-readable discovery document for each API.</p>
<p><a title="Google API Discover Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-discover-file-cabinet.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Now developers can integrate Google API discovery into client libraries, IDE plugins and other tools, making it easier to discover the API they need.  After providing an API discovery service,  Google followed another 2011 trend around deploying the <a title="Google API Explorer" href="https://code.google.com/apis/explorer/">Google API Explorer</a>.</p>
<p>Like other API explorers, <a title="Google API Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/google-api-explorer/">Google API Explorer</a> allows users to make calls and explore REST APIs using a web interface, allowing anyone to start using an API without writing any code, even when authentication using Basic Auth or OAuth is required.</p>
<p>API explorers have done a lot to improve the time it takes for developers to get up and running using an API, but nothing beats good quality code samples, and Google put some serious effort into standardized code samples that can be used across Google APIs, in multiple programming languages:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2011-09-09T15:20:00-07:00&amp;max-results=10 Google APIs"><strong>Google APIs Client Library for PHP (Beta)</strong></a></li>

<li><a href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/08/new-objective-c-library-for-new.html"><strong>Objective-C library for a new generation of APIs </strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/04/google-apis-python-library-goes-to-beta.html"><strong>Google APIs Python Library goes to Beta </strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond making it easier to discover, explore and manage APIs with Google Discovery, Google Explorer and Google Console in 2011, Google also spent a lot of time addressing API security.</p>
<p><a href="https://code.google.com/oauthplayground/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Google-OAuth-2-Playground.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The first step to <a title="improving security across Google APIs by supporting SSL" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/03/improving-security-of-google-apis-with.html">improving the security of Google APIs was by supporting SSL</a> across all Google APIs.  Next Google went all in by not just working to <a title="support OAuth across Google APIs" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/03/making-auth-easier-oauth-20-for-google.html">support OAuth 2.0 across Google APIs</a>, they want to help developers understand OAuth 2.0, making it easier to secure applications with the standard.  To help facilitate this understanding, <a title="Google opened up the oauth playground" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/11/oauth-20-playground-open-to-developers.ht">Google opened up the OAuth 2.0 Playground</a>, which is meant to simplify experimentation with the OAuth 2.0 protocol and APIs that use the protocol by developers.</p>
<p>With these moves by Google in 2011,  I think we can say that SSL support and OAuth 2.0 are two API security essentials that are here to stay.   After working on security, Google moved into the legal department with the introduction of a <a title="single Google APIs Terms of Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/12/12/google-deploys-a-single,-centralized-terms-of-use-for-apis/">single Google APIs Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>Google has rewritten their terms from the ground up with the goal of making them easier to understand for application developers, and one by one, redirecting each API to use the <a title="centralized, easier to use terms of service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/terms/index.html">centralized, easier to understand terms of service</a>.   At the moment it seems as though most of the APIs that use the central terms of service are content and data related APIs, like Google Moderator and Blogger, while more complex APIs like Youtube and Google Adwords still use their own terms of service.</p>
<p>Overall Google made some pretty significant improvements to get their API house in order. Of course in order to do this they also had to make some hard decision, like deciding to <a title="shut down 18 Google APIs in May" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/05/spring-cleaning-for-some-of-our-apis.html">shut down 18 Google APIs in May</a>, which included the Google Translate API.  A decision they reversed two months later, when they decided it was better to&nbsp;<a title="offer Google Translate as a Billable API" href="/2011/08/25/paid-version-of-google-translate-api/">offer Google Translate as a billable API</a> under Google Console.</p>

<p>As the <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> I don&rsquo;t really invent any of the API approaches I write about, I try to shed light on what others are doing.  Thats what this post is all about, shedding light on how Google is conducting the business of their APIs, so we can learn from them-- the good and the bad.</p>
<p>I think its important to remember that we are all making this shit up as we go along, of course it should be based on some experience, but ultimately we are in some seriously new territory, and even some of the biggest players in this space fumble the ball.  This fact became painfully clear in an <a title="accidental post by Steve Yegge" href="https://plus.google.com/112678702228711889851/posts/eVeouesvaVX">accidental post by Googler Steve Yegge</a>, shedding light into the API strategy of not just Google, but also Amazon.</p>
<p>So what do I take from Google&rsquo;s approach to APIs in 2011?</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>API discovery is important</li>
<li>API exploration is important </li>
<li>Centralized billing and reporting are essentials</li>
<li>Good quality code samples are essential </li>
<li>Security with SSL and OAuth 2.0 for APIs is standard </li>
<li>The legal around APIs needs to be easier and standardized </li>
<li>Sometimes, APIs go away </li>
<li>We are all making this shit up as we go along </li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of this is what we already are seeing from API service providers in the space like <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a>, Atmosphere and <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a>. But, what I don&rsquo;t see, is anyone addressing discoverability, easy legal and centralized billing, management and reporting from a developers perspective.</p>
<p>Google is addressing all of this because its in their best interest for ALL developers to be successful, where API service providers tend to focus on the success of developers who use their client APIs, not ALL developers.</p>
<p>Well, maybe in 2012 a service provider can step up with a solution that help developers discover and manage their business and legal across &ldquo;ANY&rdquo; API, or maybe Google can open the doors to any API provider to use the Google API platform as part of any Google Apps account?</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/12/20/the-fcc-lanches-api-curation-platform-called-myfcc/">The FCC Lanches API Curation Platform Called MyFCC</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">20 Dec 2011</span>
        <p><a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/fcc/My-FCC-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The FCC just launched a new platform that&nbsp;allows anyone to create, save and manage a customized page, built from widgets that pull content from FCC APIs, called <a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/">MyFCC</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first glance <a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/">MyFCC</a> might look like just another dashboard or start page, but it goes much further, as an API curation platform.</p>
<p>To understand, you have to go back to the beginning and see the scope of the problem being solved.  To deliver on its promise for a more open government, the FCC didn't just want a new website, they needed a platform.  To do this the FCC embraced an API-driven methodology while building their web site, meant to standardize the way they deliver information between internal groups, government agencies and with the public.</p>
<p><a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/seabourne-inc/Seabourne.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>At the time, the managing FCC director Steve Van Roekel, partnered with <a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/">Seabourne</a> to architect a platform that could deliver on this vision.</p>
<p>The new FCC web site would start with Drupal, providing a content management system (CMS) that would allow the FCC to focus on getting a handle on its content, centralizing it, preparing it to be shared with other departments, agencies and the public.   The federal government is drowning in content, so the entry, storage and management of this content was the first problem to solve, and an open-source platform like Drupal, was an ideal solution.</p>
<p>The new Drupal web site provided public access to the content, but the FCC needed to allow sharing of content with other departments, agencies and allow the public to get at the raw data for re-use.</p>
<p><a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/fcc/My-FCC-Available-Widgets.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<blockquote><em>"Everyone is talking about opening up data with APIs, to me it makes more sense to focus on opening up content using APIs.", says Mike Reich, owner of Seabourne.</em></blockquote>
<p>So Seabourne developed the <a title="Content API Drupal Module" href="http://seabourneinc.com/projects/contentapi/">Content API module for Drupal</a>, providing a plug-and-play API, not just for the FCC website, but for any Drupal driven website.</p>
<p>Then in April, the FCC launched their API driven content platform, stating that &ldquo;<a title="Everything Should Be An API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/04/06/everything-should-be-an-api-says-fcc/">Everything should be an API</a>&rdquo;.   In doing so the FCC did two very significant things:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Got control over their content using an open-source content management tool</li>
<li>Made their content accessible inter-department, inter-agency and with the public using APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>Now with MyFCC the FCC is providing a dashboard that allows anyone to curate content that is made available via the FCC&rsquo;s API.   Centralized content, opened up with APIs, bundled with curation tools opens up lot of potential for data journalists, analysts, scientists and other average users to derive deeper meaning from FCC operations.</p>
<p>All of this potential is made possible through a healthy dose of open source Drupal CMS, open source Drupal modules, open data, and open APIs. That is a lot of open, and shows the commitment of the FCC.</p>
<p><a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/fcc/My-FCC-Topic-Watcher.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I sat down with Mike, while in DC in October, when he first introduced me to <a title="Cumula Framework to Github" href="https://github.com/Cumula/framework">Cumula&nbsp;</a>, the framework that drives MyFCC.  During their work with the FCC, they have been committing the <a title="Cumula Framework to Github" href="https://github.com/Cumula/framework">Cumula framework to Github</a>, planting the seeds for a much larger vision of what the framework could do.</p>
<p>Cumula has the potential to act as curation platform for any single or group of APIs.  The MyFCC implementation is very tailored to serving up the FCC content, but the platform can act as a visual builder and dashboard for any topical area.  For example, the platform could be setup with widgets that pull medical content from various health, science and medical APIs, allowing users to create custom dashboards around the medical information most important and relevant to them.</p>
<p><a title="Cumulu" href="https://github.com/Cumula/framework">Cumula</a> is to API curation as <a title="Apigee Console" href="https://apigee.com/console/twitter">Apigee console</a> is to <a title="API exploration" href="/2011/03/24/explorers-open-api-access-beyond-developers/">API exploration</a>, <a title="Google API Discovery Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/">Google API Discovery Service</a> is to <a title="API discovery" href="/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">API discovery</a>, and <a title="Swagger" href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a> is to interactive API documentation.   It has the potential to be the platform that the world uses to discover, pull, curate and make sense of the flood of content and data we are only just beginning to drown in, with this new API driven economy.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/12/17/google-affiliate-network-api/">Google Affiliate Network API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">17 Dec 2011</span>
        <p><a title="Google Affiliate Network API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/gan/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/google/Google-Affiliate-Network-API.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Google just launched their new <a title="Google Affiliate Network API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/gan/index.html">Google Affiliate Network API</a>, which allows publishers and advertisers to automate various tasks related to the <a title="Google Affiliate Network" href="http://www.google.com/affiliatenetwork">Google Affiliate Network</a>.</p>
<p>The Google Affiliate Network is the affiliate network, formerly known as Doubleclick Performics, which was part of <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/doubleclick.html">Google&rsquo;s Doublick acquisition in April of 2007</a>.</p>
<p>Using the new Google Affiliate Network APIs, developers can programmaticaly manage:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Advertiser Lookup</strong> - Publishers can now use the Google Affiliate Network API to access data that advertisers have chosen to share with them.</li>
<li><strong>Event and Order Details</strong> - Developers can easily integrate data from events that occur in Google Affiliate Network into their own website's workflow and internal systems.</li>
<li><strong>Publisher Lookup</strong> - Advertisers can use the API to look up data that publishers have chosen to share with them</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to play with the network more to understand how it works from both an advertisers and publishers perspective.</p>
<p>It looks like an interesting addition to the suite of publishing, advertising and revenue generating tools from Google like <a title="Google Analytics" href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, <a title="Google Adwords" href="https://adwords.google.com/">Google Adwords</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/v3/app">Google Adsense</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/">Google Webmaster Tools</a>.</p>

        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/blueprints.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />In my quest to fully understand the underlying principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), i'm re-reading Roy Thomas Fielding original dissertation, <a title="Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architecture" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a>, where he first introduced the REST architectural style.</p>
<p>His dissertation explored the junction of two disciplines in computer science: <em>software and networking</em>.</p>
<p>He identifies that software research:</p>
<blockquote><em>...has long been concerned with the categorization of software designs and the development of design methodologies, but has rarely been able to objectively evaluate the impact of various design choices on system behavior.</em></blockquote>
<p>While networking research:</p>
<blockquote><em>...is focused on the details of generic communication behavior between systems and improving the performance of particular communication techniques, often ignoring the fact that changing the interaction style of an application can have more impact on performance than the communication protocols used for that interaction.</em></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/parthenon.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> Fieldings work was motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software.  He wanted to rethink software design in the context of the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web is intended to be an Internet-scale, distributed system, interconnecting information networks across organizational boundaries, and cope with the demands of scalability and independent deployment of software.</p>
<p>As Fielding states:</p>
<blockquote><em>REST provides a set of architectural constraints that, when applied as a whole, emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.</em></blockquote>
<p>As I'm reading his abstract and introduction I can't help but think about where I stand as an <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/api-evangelism-vs-developer-evangelism/">API Evangelist</a>, at the convergence of business and RESTful APIs.</p>
<p>When RESTful APIs are applied to business, what does this look like?  Is business currently restricted in the same ways as software?  When business is operating on the World Wide Web do we need to consider the network more?</p>
<p>Lots to consider at the intersection of business and RESTful APIs.</p>

<p>Google has made another step towards a more common API infrastructure in line with their <a title="API Discovery Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">API Discovery Service</a>, <a title="Google API Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/google-api-explorer/">API Explorer</a>, and <a title="Google API Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">API Console</a> by launching a <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/terms/index.html">single terms of service for all Google APIs</a>.</p>
<p>Google has rewritten their terms from the ground up with the goal of making them easier to understand for application developers.</p>
<p>At the moment it seems as though most of the APIs that use the central terms of service are content and data related APIs, like <a title="Google Tasks" href="http://code.google.com/apis/tasks/terms.html">Google Tasks</a>, <a title="Google Moderator" href="http://code.google.com/apis/moderator/terms.html">Google Moderator</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Google Charts" href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/terms.html">Google Charts</a> and <a title="Blogger" href="http://code.google.com/apis/blogger/terms.html">Blogger</a>.</p>
<p>While more complex APIs like <a title="Youtube Terms of Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/terms.html">Youtube</a>, <a title="Google Analytics" href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html">Google Analytics</a>, <a title="Google Adwords Terms of Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/adwords/docs/terms.html">Google Adwords</a> and <a title="Google Latitude" href="http://code.google.com/apis/latitude/terms.html">Google Latitude</a> still use their own terms of service.  Over time, more APIs will be migrated to the new, centralized terms of service format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With almost 100 APIs now, it makes sense for Google to reduce the complexity of terms of use across APIs, increasing the chances a developer will &ldquo;legally&rdquo; build an application or business around one or multiple Google APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google provides tools for developers to easily discover, explore their APIs, while also providing centralized management of billing, usage reporting and terms of use. &nbsp;I predict we will see other API service providers offering tools for managing <a title="terms of use" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/terms_of_use__conditions.php">terms of use</a>, <a title="branding" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/branding.php">branding</a> and other legal aspects of API management in 2012.</p>

     <a title="4,480 APIs in the Directory" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/programmableweb/ProgrammableWeb-API-Directory.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I recently pulled the title, description and tags for all the APIs in the <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgramableWeb</a> directory into a local MySQL database. At the time of this writing there are <a title="4,480 APIs in the Directory" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">4,480 public APIs in the directory</a>.
</p>
<p>
     My goal is build a better search and discovery interface, so I can get a handle on all these APIs. Which ones I should be paying attention to, recommending to developers and generally just have an awareness of what types of APIs are available.
</p>
<p>
     Where do I start?
</p>
<p>
     First I start with a keyword search on the title, description and tags associated with each API. I will build a bunch of custom search queries, but no matter how good my queries are, I’m still limited by whatever descriptions are associated with the APIs and whatever tags were applied. This is just search, it isn’t discovery or real-time tracking.
</p>
<p>
     Having gone through whole categories of image APIs and storage APIs by hand I know there is a lot of crap APIs that aren’t in my opinion, real API efforts. They just throw up an API, register it with ProgrammableWeb and don’t actually have a supporting area for developers.
</p>
<p>
     I need a way to programmatically rank each API while searching through APIs. When I search for photo management APIs, I want them sorted by some sort of value. Currently ProgrammableWeb uses the number of mashups of an API as a “popularity” ranking. I need more and I figured <a title="Compete" href="https://www.compete.com/developer/">Compete</a> and <a title="Alexa" href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a> APIs could give me some sense of the value of each API based upon its domain. This is just a start and I want to establish a <a title="wide variety of metrics for measuring the value delivered by an API" href="/2011/04/21/measuring-the-popularity-of-apis/">wide variety of metrics for measuring the value delivered by an API</a>.

     My API ranking algorithm is obviously a work in progress. I just figured I’d tell the story of how I evolve my API ranking algorthm here, and leave open for comment and others to add to. But as I work to make sense of 4,480 APIs, I can’t help but think--what does a world with 100K open APIs look like?

</p>
<p>
     <a title="Hackathons" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/events/">Hackathons</a> are growing into a popular way to spark innovation around hardware, data and APIs within developer and hacker communities. I count over 40 hackathons going on in December alone, and this is just what I can discover and keep up with in my research.
</p>
<p>
     Hackathons are also being used by many companies to drive innovation internally between departments. Businesses like <a title="LinkedIn" href="http://blog.linkedin.com/category/linkedin-hackdays/">LinkedIn</a> and <a title="Zappos" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/07/19/how-zappos-drives-internal-innovation-with-its-public-api/">Zappos</a> employ Hackathons and Hack Days internally to get recreate this same hackathon phenomenon within their own companies, in a much more controlled, safe environment.
</p>
<p>
     Now Zappos is going even further and opening up their Internal Hackathon to the public. December 12th through the 16th of 2011 they are holding the <a title="Zappos API Hackathon" href="http://developer.zappos.com/blog/zappos-api-hackathon-hack-long-contest">Zappos API Hackathon Hack-a-long</a>, which in the past, has been an event open only to Zappos employees, but this year, they want the public to hack alongside of Zappos employees.
</p>
<p>
     On Monday, Dec 12th, Zappos will post a theme on their blog, and developers will have one week to hack up a project that fits in with the theme. Zappos will be awarding three $100 gift cards for <a title="Zappos.com" href="http://www.Zappos.com">Zappos.com</a> to the winners in three categories: Best Mashup, Best Overall, and Most Fun and Weird.
</p>
<p>
     Public developer apps will be presented along side internal Zappos employee projects, during their Hackathon Open House. The goal of the event is to help inspire Zappos developers and expose them to the passion and creative juices of the public Zappos developer community.
</p>
<p>
     I’m spending a lot of time tracking on the evolving Hackathon phenonemon and how these events are spurring innovating both internally within companies and externally in public developer communities in cities around the globe. I’ll keep tracking on the innovation and talent coming out of hackathons and I am excited to see more companies adopt them internally and even inviting the public to come participate in the hacking!

<p>
     There was a post a couple weeks back in the <a title="New York Times Bits Blog" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/">New York Times Bits Blog</a> called, "<a title="TaskRabbit Looks to Expand Cities and Offers an API" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/10/taskrabbit-looks-to-expand-cities-and-offer-an-a-p-i/">TaskRabbit Looks to Expand Cities and Offer an A.P.I.</a>"
</p>
<p>
     Its a pretty straightforward post about the San Francisco based start-up, that gets you in touch with friendly, reliable people who can help you get just about anything you need done. At first glance, it is a pretty standard post. However I feel there are two things very notable about this post and more specifically, it’s title:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>TaskRabbit Looks to Expand Cities and Offer an A.P.I.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     One, the launching of an API is tied directly to the startups expansion into other cities. Those of us in the know, understand the important role an API plays in scaling your company, but explaining this to mainstream audiences is so important.
</p>
<p>
     Two, that the acronym "API" gets used in a title of a mainstream publication like the New York Times.  Of course they spell it out in the article, but the editor expects that the user will understand the acronym in the title.
</p>
<p>
     There are many API stories in 2011, but I think this really shows APIs are coming of age, when it is acceptable for a wider, mainstream audience to accept the term into their vocabulary.
</p>
<p>
     One of the things I like about APIs is they are a silent, but powerful force behind many industry sectors including e-commerce, social, cloud computing and mobile computing. I think this use of API in the NYT represent classic API style, a silent coming of age, showing APIs are being adopted by a mainstream audience.

        <span class="post-date">28 Nov 2011</span>
        <p>
     There was a post in the Atlantic about Twitter’s advertising network called, <a title="No One's Noticing Twitter's New Ad Experiment, Which is a Good Thing" href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/11/no-ones-noticing-twitters-new-ad-experiment-which-good-thing/45143/">No One's Noticing Twitter's New Ad Experiment, Which Is a Good Thing</a>.
</p>
<p>
     Twitter is dropping what they call “promoted tweets” into users timelines. Adam Clark Estes of the Atlantic states:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>Despite months of hemming and hawing over the danger of polluting the sacred Twitter feed, the few people that have taken notice seem reasonably pleased by the hands-off approach.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     A user, also cited in the article, Ellis Hamburger at Business Insider thinks the approach is awesome:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>I realized that Promoted Tweets really aren't that much different from TV commercials—brief interruptions from your content.</em>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
     <em>Except they're not very annoying. …</em>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
     <em>Twitter's commercials are different and have a leg up because they will be intermixed with incredibly time-sensitive content. They're also brief, which helps. And a lot of of the time, Promoted Tweets are from celebrities who tweet their thoughts in their own voice.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     I’m following Twitter’s rollout of their advertising network because its a big deal to finally see the popular micro-blogging platform finally move towards monetizing the network--even if some don’t like it. But I think the work Twitter is doing has even bigger implications, on the future of online advertising, even beyond social media.
</p>
<p>
     The Internets seem to be stuck in a rut, when it comes to monetization of our online real estate. There isn’t much innovation beyond the classic online and slightly newer mobile advertising platforms dominated by Google and a handful of others. What is next?
</p>
<p>
     <a title="advertising network dedicated to APIs" href="/2011/09/28/advertising-network-dedicated-to-apis-and-developers/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-API-Advertising.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     APIs of course. As APIs also struggle to develop their monetization strategies, they tend to default to charging for their services, with some API providers like <a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid</a> are providing mobile and web advertising solutions alongside their APIs.
</p>
<p>
     I feel what Twitter is doing is one possible model for other API owners to follow in monetizing their API platforms. Provide relevant, seamless advertising embedded into each API stream. When it comes to content APIs this is easy to envision, but with other forms of media and resources it will get much more complicated.
</p>
<p>
     Twitter, was made successful by its API community, with all its web and mobile properties consuming its API, and the service itself resembles many APIs in how it works. Perhaps the work Twitter is doing can be used as a model for building out an <a title="advertising network dedicated to APIs" href="/2011/09/28/advertising-network-dedicated-to-apis-and-developers/">advertising network dedicated to APIs</a>, baking in monetization into each and every API call, before it reaches the web or mobile application layers.

        <span class="post-date">28 Nov 2011</span>
        <p><a title="Defag Conf" href="http://defragcon.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/defrag-2011/defrag-2011.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>"Are API service providers relevant?  Will they remain relevant?"</p>
<p>Thats the question asked by Ben Kepes at this years <a title="Defag Conf" href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag Conference</a>, while moderating a panel with Apigee's Sam Ramji and Mashery's Neil Mansilla.</p>
<p>It was a bold question to ask, perhaps, in front of an audience comprised of people from 3Scale, Apigee, Mashery and Alcatel Lucent -- all API service providers.  And Sam's response was to dismiss Ben's question was &ldquo;stupid&rdquo;, steering the conversation elsewhere.</p>
<p>Sam seemed to interpret Ben&rsquo;s question as an affront -- not just to Apigee but arguably to all the API providers in the room.  But in light of Sam's own arguments about the importance of thinking about apps as intermediaries, I thought Ben's question was particularly interesting.  After all, many of these API services providers do just that -- act as intermediaries.</p>
<p>On the surface Ben&rsquo;s question may have seemed to be picking a fight with Sam, but I think he meant it, and was seriously asking it of the industry, and I feel it is an important question. I personally think API service providers have a role to play, and can stay relevant if...if they do not impose themselves as intermediaries, but I would love to hear what others think.</p>
<p>I believe doing business in the API space, centers around providing clear value to your customers, without getting in their way.  In the words of Jeff Lawson of Twilio, "Get out of the way of the Doers!".  This philosophy applies to API service providers as well.</p>
<p>To stay relevant, the API service providers have to practice what they preach to their customers; be service oriented, decouple and allow their customers to be doers via a self-service, clearly priced, secure platform while providing added value in the form of premium services.  Without this practice, API services providers just reflect the old way of building and selling software, not the new API driven world.</p>
<p>Beyond the <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a> and <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a> API service providers of the world, we also need to acknowledge there is a continued need for open-source tools and platforms that can deliver the services that businesses need for their APIs.   These tools allow for a vibrant ecosystem of service providers to support these tools and platforms just like with other open-source software communities.  Maybe the existing API service providers can even contribute to these projects and champion the cause?</p>
<p>I guess my point is, that things change quickly,  you have to have to be agile, flexible and deliver clear value to stay relevant.  This applies to any business, API service providers are not exempt.  In today's fast paced, technology driven business climate, I don't think any business leader can dismiss this question, and I think everyone should ask it often...how can I remain relevant?  Great question Ben!</p>

</p>
<p>
     There is a lot of discussion around the growth of APIs, and what the future will look like. How will we discover and make sense of the number of available APIs, and quickly get to work integrating with the APIs that bring the most value to our apps and businesses.
</p>
<p>
     One technology that comes up in every conversation I’ve had is <a title="Swagger" href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">Swagger</a>. What is Swagger?
</p>
<blockquote>
     <strong><em>Swagger is a specification and complete framework implementation for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services.</em></strong>
</blockquote>
<p>
     The goal of Swagger is to enable client and documentation systems to update at the same pace as the server. The documentation of methods, parameters and models are tightly integrated into the server code, allowing APIs to always stay in sync.
</p>
<p>
     Swagger was born out of initiatives from <a title="Wordnik" href="http://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a>, developed for Wordnik’s own use during the development of <a title="developer.wordnik.com" href="http://developer.wordnik.com/">developer.wordnik.com</a>. Swagger development began in early 2010 and the framework being released is used by Wordnik’s APIs, which power both internal and external API clients.
</p>
<p>
     Swagger provides a declarative resource specification, allowing users to understand and consume services without knowledge of server implementation, enabling both developers and non-developers to interact with the API, providing clear insight into how the API responds to parameters and options.
</p>
<p>
     I’m familiarizing myself with the specification more and playing with the various tools they provide:
</p>
<p>
     <a title="Swagger" href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/"></a><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/swagger/Swagger-Screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Swagger UI</strong> - A dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation from a Swagger-compliant API
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Swagger Core</strong> - Defines Java annotations and required logic to generate a Swagger server or client.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Swagger CodeGen</strong> - Contains a template-driven engine to generate client code in different languages by parsing your Swagger Resource Declaration.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Swagger node.js</strong> - A Sample App is a fully-functioning, stand-alone Swagger server written in javascript which uses node.js and the express framework.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Swagger Scala Sample App</strong> - A fully-functioning, stand-alone Swagger server written in Scala which demonstrates how to enable Swagger in your API.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Swagger Java Sample App</strong> - A fully-functioning, stand-alone Swagger server written in Java which demonstrates how to enable Swagger in your API.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I understand that Swagger is not the one specification to rule all APIs, and it won’t make all religious API fanatics happy. But I want to start somewhere. I see three main benefits for API owners coming from adopting Swagger:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Automated, consistent generation of clean, beautiful, interactive API documentation
     </li>
     <li>Generation of client code and SDK in multiple languages
     </li>
     <li>Feeding into an industry wide API discovery language that both developers and non-developers can use
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I believe strongly that consistent documentation and code samples ensure an API will get used, but as the number of APIs grows, a system like <a title="Google API Discovery Service" href="/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">Google API Discovery Service</a>, will be essential for API adoption across industries and around the globe. I’m hoping to learn more about Swagger, and see if it can help deliver on this vision.

</p>
<p>
     <a title="Last March Google support OAuth 2.0" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/03/14/google-api-access-with-oauth-2-0/">Last March Google started support OAuth 2.0 for all of their APIs</a>, and has been pushing all developers to switch to using OAuth 2.0 in all applications.
</p>
<p>
     Today they announced the <a href="https://code.google.com/oauthplayground/" target="_blank">OAuth 2.0 Playground</a> which allows developers to experiment with APIs using the OAuth 2.0 protocol, and understand how the protocol functions and will make your life easier.
</p>
<p>
     The OAuth 2.0 Playground enables developers to walk through each step of the OAuth 2.0 flow for server-side web applications:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Authorizing API scopes
     </li>
     <li>Exchanging authorization tokens
     </li>
     <li>Refreshing access tokens
     </li>
     <li>Sending authorized requests to API endpoints
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     At each step, the Playground displays the full HTTP requests and responses for each API.
</p>
<p>
     Google’s endorsement of OAuth 2.0 was very important for the standard and the API industry as a whole. APIs need a secure and standard way for users to authenticate and allow access to their resources when using web and mobile apps.  With Twitter, Google, Facebook and other heavyhitters on board, OAuth is here to stay.
</p>
<p>
     OAuth has traditionally been difficult for some developers to implement, which has gotten easier with 2.0. But we all have to work to help developers understand its value and how to implement--tools like <a href="https://code.google.com/oauthplayground/" target="_blank">Google OAuth 2.0 Playground</a> will go a long way in helping developers understand the standard, ensuring that users app experience is pleasant and secure, and APIs are seen as a secure and efficient way to builld applications around.

<p><a title="Pioneer Corporation" href="http://pioneer.jp/">Pioneer Corporation</a> just announced the availability of Zypr&trade;, a new voice-powered API that  provides a conversational, voice-control command API allowing developers to integrate <a title="Siri" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html">Siri</a> like functionality into their own applications.</p>
<p>The <a title="Zypr API" href="http://www.zypr.net/">Zypr API</a> provides a single RESTful API for developers to access voice UI, maps and routing, local search, social networking, music and radio, contacts, calendars and weather from multiple service providers, including:  Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yelp, AccuWeather, INRIX real-time and predictive traffic information, Slacker Radio, Tuner2 Radio, Wcities, xAd and VoiceBox.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve covered <a title="unified and aggregate APIs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/09/13/unified-data-apis-for-geo,-weather-and-beyond/">unified and aggregate APIs</a> in the past, where within maturing industries like social and cloud computing, service providers are stepping up with a single API to work with multiple providers.  Zypr is similar in that it offers a single API for multiple providers, but uses voice as the mechanism for search.   Zypyr&rsquo;s goal is to normalize, stable and voice-enhanced method for accessing a wide array of constantly changing APIs, Zypr can reduces the impact of service-specific API changes.</p>
<p><a title="Zypr API" href="http://www.zypr.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Zypr/Zypr-Server-Architecture.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Pioneer created Zypr so that any type of developer or device maker on any platform can easily offer compelling new services to enhance their own technology and brand equity,&rdquo; said Susumu Kotani, the president of Pioneer Corporation. &ldquo;We have also changed the rules by allowing developers and device makers alike the opportunity to share in revenue when they deploy Zypr.&rdquo;</p>

        <p><a title="Atmosphere API Management" href="http://atmos.phe.re/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/soa/atmosphere-logo-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I first reported on service oriented architecture (SOA) pioneer <a href="http://www.soa.com/">SOA Software&rsquo;s</a> entry into the API management arena <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/atmosphere-a-new-api-management-portal/">back in June</a>, today at the Cloud Computing Expo in Santa Clara, CA they are announcing the beta release of their enterprise API management solution called <a title="Atmosphere API Management" href="http://atmos.phe.re/">Atmos.phe.re</a>.</p>
<p>SOA has taken their enterprise API management solution, and bundled it with many of the features we are growing accustomed to within open API ecosystems, and deployed as a new solution with a focus on community.</p>
<p>The new platform intends to bring together API owners and application developers into a community, providing a central place where an ecosystem can grow around each of your APIs, whether its a private or public initiative.</p>
<p>Atmosphere is taking the social aspects of popular, open API ecosystems, and are applying these concepts to the enterprise, providing not only a place where API owners and developers can come together, but it also invites business, marketing and creative folks to get involved--creating a truly collaborative, enterprise environment around any API initiative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enterprises now have a choice in how they provide APIs. They can use Atmosphere Cloud to manage their developer community, and process messages on-premise.&rdquo; said Alistair Farquharson, Chief Technology Officer, SOA Software. &ldquo;This provides companies with complete control over their API traffic without requiring a large internal infrastructure to support their developer community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This evolution of the API ecosystem makes sense, by providing the same set of social features available within both public and private communities as well as on-premise or cloud deployments it provides a very agile, business development environment for enterprises to take advantage of.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a full test drive of SOA&rsquo;s new platform, but from what I&rsquo;ve seen it posseses all the characteristics I&rsquo;ve seen with other API management providers, but also brings to the table important social and community layers that I think are essential to the future of APIs.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclosure:</strong> &nbsp;I have consulted for SOA Software.</em></p>

<p>I came across this on the White House blog today, &ldquo;<a title="Request for Information on Public Access to Digital Data and Scientific Publications" href="http://m.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/11/07/request-information-public-access-digital-data-and-scientific-publications">Request for Information on Public Access to Digital Data and Scientific Publications</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The <a title="America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010" href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.5116:">America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010</a>, signed by President Obama earlier this year, calls upon OSTP to coordinate with agencies to develop policies that assure widespread public access to and long-term stewardship of the results of federally funded unclassified research. Towards that goal, OSTP last week released two Requests for Information (RFI) soliciting public input on long term preservation of and public access to the results of federally funded research, including digital data and peer-reviewed scholarly publications.</p>
<p>The White House is now seeking additional insight from "non-Federal stakeholders, including the public, universities, nonprofit and for-profit publishers, libraries, federally funded and non-federally funded research scientists, and other organizations and institutions with an interest in long- term stewardship and improved public access to the results of federally funded research".  Specifically the Working Group seeks further public comment on the questions listed below:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>What specific Federal policies would encourage public access to and the preservation of broadly valuable digital data resulting from federally funded scientific research, to grow the U.S. economy and improve the productivity of the American scientific enterprise?</li>
<li>What specific steps can be taken to protect the intellectual property interests of publishers, scientists, Federal agencies, and other stakeholders, with respect to any existing or proposed policies for encouraging public access to and preservation of digital data resulting from federally funded scientific research?</li>
<li>How could Federal agencies take into account inherent differences between scientific disciplines and different types of digital data when developing policies on the management of data?</li>
<li>How could agency policies consider differences in the relative costs and benefits of long-term stewardship and dissemination of different types of data resulting from federally funded research?</li>
<li>How can stakeholders (e.g., research communities, universities, research institutions, libraries, scientific publishers) best contribute to the implementation of data management plans?</li>
<li>How could funding mechanisms be improved to better address the real costs of preserving and making digital data accessible?</li>
<li>What approaches could agencies take to measure, verify, and improve compliance with Federal data stewardship and access policies for scientific research?</li>
How can the burden of compliance and verification be minimized?
<li>What additional steps could agencies take to stimulate innovative use of publicly accessible research data in new and existing markets and industries to create jobs and grow the economy?</li>
<li>What mechanisms could be developed to assure that those who produced the data are given appropriate attribution and credit when secondary results are reported?</li>
Standards for Interoperability, Re-Use and Re-Purposing
<li>What digital data standards would enable interoperability, reuse, and repurposing of digital scientific data?</li>
For example, MIAME (minimum information about a microarray experiment; see Brazma et al., 2001, Nature Genetics 29, 371) is an example of a community-driven data standards effort.
<li>What are other examples of standards development processes that were successful in producing effective standards and what characteristics of the process made these efforts successful?</li>
<li>How could Federal agencies promote effective coordination on digital data standards with other nations and international communities?</li>
<li>What policies, practices, and standards are needed to support linking between publications and associated data?</li>
</ol>
<p>As I was reading through these questions I can&rsquo;t help think about the <a title="API Service Provider Platforms" href="http://apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/">API service provider platforms</a> that I review on a regular basis, and how APIs can be employed for opening up this research.   Responses to this RFI will be accepted through January 12, 2012.  I&rsquo;m going to spend the holidays thinking about how APIs can best facilitate public access to this federally funded research, and I wanted to turn it into more discussion here on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> and see what others have to say.</p>
<p>As I answer each question I&rsquo;m going to try and publish as separate blog post, feel free share your comments as I work through.</p>

<p>I wrote a piece yesterday on the FCC Open Commission recent proposal to require that television stations make their &ldquo;public inspection file&rdquo; available online called, &ldquo;<a title="Opening Up Information is Not Enough, It Needs to Be Open" href="/2011/11/02/opening-up-information-is-not-enough,-its-needs-to-be-accessible/">Opening Up Information is Not Enough, Its Needs to be Accessible</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Since writing I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how APIs can become a self-service tool in government regulation.  Here are my rough thoughts on the subject, completely un-polished.</p>
<p>When a government agency mandates that an industry provide some information, along with that request should come with a mandate on a standard for the data format and making it accessible via an API. &nbsp;Of course this could come with some sort of security layer, so not everything is immediately open, but the more open the better.</p>
<p>Along with the regulatory mandate the requesting agency could have some sort of aggregate tool for pull the requested data from each entities API, making available internally and externally as needed for other agencies, researchers or the general public.</p>
<p>This type of self-service, API driven, regulatory framework could force businesses and organizations within an industry to comply with necessary information requirements, reduce the overhead for the governing body to collect and organize the data, while also opening up the data, to allow the public and other industry groups to police and make sure companies are complying.</p>
<p>Seems like it could make the overall process around industry regulation more efficient, while putting the responsibility for policing on the public and other public interest groups, reducing the need for government enforcement that can often be bought.</p>

     <a title="Verizon Wireless" href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/index.html"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/verizon/verizon-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>

<p>
     According to PCMag.com, <a title="Verizon will publish an API that could allow consumers to turbocharge the network bandwidth" href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2395728,00.asp?kc=PCRSS05039TX1K0000762#fbid=r4tz9kBNC_8">Verizon will publish an API that could allow consumers to "turbocharge" the network bandwidth</a> on their smartphone, for a small fee.
</p>
<p>
     Developers could give users the option to pay for the extra bandwidth using a separate micro-transaction API, that Verizon Wireless is developing and hopes to have in place by the end of 2012.
</p>
<p>
     I understand that wireless networks are often congested. But isn’t allowing someone to pay money and circumvent that congestion, creating two separate Internets? A faster one for those that can afford it and a slower one for those that cannot?
</p>
<p>
     Would certain companies be able to offer users “turbocharge credits” when using their apps? So the Internet was faster, only when using the apps that could afford to buy its users attention.
</p>
<p>
     I am pleased to see <a title="Verizon Wireless" href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/index.html">Verizon Wireless</a> working on network optimization tools, but is this where we need to monetize the network? Seems like you could make the Internet fast for everyone and charge for other premium services.  You know, really innovate.

<p>
     <a title="Tru.ly" href="https://tru.ly">Tru.ly</a> just launched an <a title="Tru.ly" href="https://tru.ly">age verification API</a> that authenticates the age of an online user based by cross-referencing user-submitted personal information with data points from Tru.ly verification partners.
</p>
<p>
     Verification is done by matching user-submitted information with that in a national database of government and public data. In order to become verified, specific pieces of information must match. Tru.ly also uses a proprietary technology to flag users who may be trying to game the system.
</p>
<p>
     Using Tru.ly, websites with restricted content such as movies, alcohol and video games can programmatically verify its user’s ages, going beyond using just asking for a birth date.
</p>
<p>
     The API was developed to confirm an age while also promoting the guidelines set forth in the <a href="http://www.coppa.org/coppa">Children Online Privacy Protection Act</a> (COPPA), specifically section 1302-9, which defines verifiable parental consent as any reasonable effort, so as to ensure that the parent is aware of the website’s personal information collection, use, and disclosure practices.

</p>
<p>
     The <a title="FCC Open Comission" href="http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/open-commission-meetings-schedule-2011">FCC Open Commission</a> recently proposed to require that television stations make their “public inspection file” available online. The public inspection file is a traditional hallmark of broadcast regulation--a collection of documents that all radio and television stations must maintain and make publicly accessible.
</p>
<p>
     But as the <a title="Technology Liberation Front" href="http://techliberation.com/2011/10/31/fcc-requires-online-public-inspection-files-but-misses-point-of-opengov-data-accessibility/">Technology Liberation Front points out</a>, “availability is not accessibility”, stating:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>"If the FCC follows its usual practice of having filers submit PDFs (many of which are often scanned from printed documents), this data may be nearly useless to the small number of researchers who would really benefit from having a large set of public inspection files available online."</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     This is a common misconception among government agencies, that just publishing a PDF to a web is making the information “accessible”. Sure anyone can download this information, but it makes extracting meaning and value across many television stations so much work, pretty much nobody will do it. Researchers need this type of true access to compare data across stations, and identify larger trends and patterns that exist.
</p>
<p>
     This approach to information disclosure is does not meet the transparency guidelines set by the Obama Administration to implement Open Government by requiring agencies to:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>"publish information online in an open format that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched by commonly used web search applications. An open format is one that is platform independent, machine readable, and made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the re-use of that information."</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/fcc/television-icon.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     Transparency offers an alternative to regulation that goes all the way back to President Clinton’s Executive Order 12866 (1993) which states "Each agency shall identify and assess available alternatives to direct regulation, including … providing information upon which choices can be made by the public."
</p>
<p>
     Federal agencies requiring business to collect and make information to the public, without also requiring that they submit it in a machine-readable format, creates more bureaucratic, useless government. There needs to be more education of officials who oversee transparency initiatives and make sure that truly understand what is needed to make data open and accessible.

     I’m spending some time getting to know the <a href="http://topsylabs.com/products/api/">Topsy Labs API</a> today. <a title="Topsy Labs" href="http://topsylabs.com/">Topsy Labs</a> offers access to its proprietary metrics, social content, and influence data via a RESTful API. As I was reviewing, their API access and rates limit page caught my eye.
</p>
<p>
     Here is their intro paragraph:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>We provide limited, free API access so that you can quickly and easily test the service and confirm the value it will provide to your business. We have three different tiers to match your implementation.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     What is interesting, is they not only provide a freemium level they have one better, a free and open tier, provider two introductory API access levels:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>No API Key</strong> - 3,000 queries/day – API calls that do not carry an API key will be limited to 3,000 queries/day.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Free API Key</strong> - 7,000 queries/day – API calls that carry an API key will increase their limit to 7,000 queries/day.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Then they provide a quick link: <a title="Register to get Started" href="http://manage.topsy.com/app/create">Register to get started</a>
</p>
<p>
     What an inviting, frictionless way to getting started with an API. For those wanting more, they also provide information about obtaining a commercial API key:
</p>
<p class="c2">
     <em>Once you confirm the value of our API, you can get a commercial license, giving you more volume to accommodate your business needs, exposes other valuable API calls, provides you with technical support, and ensures you are guaranteed specific service level parameters.</em>
</p>
<p>
     The Topsy Labs approach provides an interesting model for some API owners to provide limited and free API access to their APIs, enabling developers to quickly and easily test the service and confirm the value before integrating.

        <p>
     <a title="API Industries" href="/industries/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-Industries.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I try to pay attention to how APIs are transforming as many <a title="API Industries" href="/industries/">industries</a> as I can. I usually carve out at least an hour each day, to evalute a specific industry, the APIs in it, trying to understand what each API delivers and how the industry works, while also identifying where the opportunities lie.
</p>
<p>
     Right now I am looking at two areas or industries of APIs:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Cloud Storage APIs" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/projects/project_detail.php?ID=36">Cloud Storage APIs</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Image and Photo APIs" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/projects/project_detail.php?ID=35">Image and Photo APIs</a>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Even though I want to be familiar with both these areas, and will write stories on everything I find, my primary goal is to provide the <a title="Mimeo" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> development team with as much information, about the best document and photo storage APIs available for integrating into our systems.
</p>
<p>
     There are <a title="46 storage APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?apicat=Storage">46 storage APIs</a> and <a title="120 photo APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?apicat=Photos">120 photo APIs</a> in the <a title="ProgrammableWeb Directory" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/">ProgrammableWeb directory</a>. I went through all of the APIs and pulled out the APIs that were RESTful, had potential for print integration and were popular or were a stable, quality service. I found 19 storage APIs and 12 photo APIs I felt were a fit.
</p>
<p>
     After looking at 166 APIs and pulling out 31 APIs that offered value, you walk away with a pretty good sense of what makes a good API deployment. Anyone who is launching an API should spend time looking at at least 50 other APIs before building their own. API areas should simple, straight the point and employ the <a title="essential API building blocks" href="/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">essential API building blocks</a>.
</p>
<p>
     I’d say the biggest problem with each API is: <em><strong>What the hell does this API do?</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
     Every API should put a really simple explanation of what it does in 150 words or less. Pretend you just have one tweet to use. What value does your API deliver? Make it count!
</p>
<p>
     There are so many other things I consider when evaluating an API, these are a few of my immediate concerns while trying to quickly assess a lot of APIs. Think about it, I’m only dealing with 166 APIs out of 4000 APIs. What will this look like when we have 100K + APIs?

     Twilio just made their first move into Europe by offering <a title="Twilio Voice Service in the United Kingdom" href="http://www.twilio.com/blog/2011/10/twilio-launches-in-europe-opens-office-london.html">Twilio Voice service in the United Kingdom</a>.
</p>
<p>
     The <a title="Twilio Voice API" href="http://www.twilio.com/api/voice">Twilio Voice API</a> is now available in the UK, allowing developers to launch local phone numbers in the country.  Along with the release Twilio has announced the opening of their first international office based in East London.
</p>
<p>
     The UK launch is the first to go live of five countries currently in Beta including France, Poland, Austria, Denmark and Portugal with several more countries on the way.
</p>
<p>
     Twilio's APIs have proven a favorite of developers, and fast becoming an essential cloud computing service for applications.
</p>
<p>
     The move into Europe will only grow their developer base and the number of applications using the cloud telephony API. Something that traditional telcos should take notice of.

        <span class="post-date">26 Oct 2011</span>
        <p>Last week <a title="Mashery" href="http://mashery.com/">Mashery</a> rolled out a new on-premise version of their API management proxy. &nbsp;A solution meant to address a common concern of IT and API owners, that when using Mashery, all of their data and resources run through the Mashery proxy in the cloud. &nbsp;This concern can be a show stopper for many companies.</p>
<p>Until this last week, Mashery had four API management solutions that all ran in the cloud.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashery/Mashery-Products-1.png" alt="" width="500" align="center" /></p>
<p>Now Mashery has separated the proxy portion of their traffic manager into two offerings, one for the cloud and one for on-premise.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashery/API-Traffic-Cloud-Local.png" alt="" width="500" align="center" /></p>
<p>Mashery has bundled the new Mashery Cloud and Mashery Local with their existing API Traffic, API Analytics &amp; Reporting and API Portal and are calling it, the Mashery API control center.  Using the API control center you now have the flexibility to deploy on-premise or in the cloud as needed.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashery/mashery-api-control-center.jpg" alt="" width="500" align="center" /></p>
<p>Of course the full benefits of the Mashery API Distribution Network which includes scalability, redundancy, PCI compliance, access to global partner network and SLA&rsquo;s are only available for APIs deployed using Mashery Cloud.</p>
<p>Even though the&nbsp;<a title="Mashery API Control Center" href="http://mashery.com/solution/controlcenter/">Mashery API Control Center</a> is meant to provide flexibility of deployment for API owners, the move is clearly a direct shot at their primary competitor Apigee, who have had an on-premise solution for some time, but <a title="Mashery" href="/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a> claims their control center provides much more flexibility than "their competitors".</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/10/25/the-api-service-provider-i-missed-vordel/">The API Service Provider I Missed, Vordel</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2011</span>
        <p><a title="Vordel" href="http://www.vordel.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/vordel/Vordel-API-Management.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have done a lot of research lately on the <a title="API Service Provider" href="/serviceproviders/">API service provider</a> landscape.  My goal is to understand who provides API delivery and management services, what they offer and help API owners understand the differences.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a title="roundup of 11 of the API service providers" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/10/19/api-service-provider-roundup/">roundup of 11 of the API service providers on ProgrammableWeb</a> last week.  I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of all the providers, but of course a new one came out of the woodwork.</p>
<p>It wasn't a new API service provider like <a href="/serviceproviders/mashape.php">Mashape</a> or <a href="/2011/10/07/easy-api-development-with-apiary-io/">Apiary.io</a>, it is a veteran player in the space, <a title="Vordel" href="http://www.vordel.com/">Vordel</a>.  Vordel has been around for almost 10 years and I would consider them part of the old guard of service oriented architecture (SOA) and web services providers, that existed before web APIs were cool.</p>
<p>Vordel provides a range of products we recognize with enterprise API deployments including <a title="API Gateways" href="http://www.vordel.com/solutions/api_gateway2.html">API Gateways</a>, <a title="XML Firewalls" href="http://www.vordel.com/solutions/xml_firewall.html">XML firewalls</a> and <a title="XML accelerators" href="http://www.vordel.com/solutions/xml_accelerator.html">accelerators</a>.  Vordel specializes in the legacy system connectors that are needed to bring existing enterprise systems into the new web API game.</p>
<p>The Vordel API Gateway compares to what I've seen from <a title="Layer7" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/layer-7-technologies-launches-new-api-portal/">Layer7</a> and <a title="SOA Software" href="/2011/06/17/atmosphere-a-new-api-management-portal/">SOA Software</a>, with the following key features:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/vordel/Vordel-API-Gateway.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Protocol translation for REST and SOAP</li>
<li>Versioning and lifecycle management</li>
<li>Caching of frequently used calls</li>
<li>Monitor, log and audit usage</li>
<li>Secure API from threats</li>
<li>Service level agreements (SLA)</li>
</ul>
<p>Vordel has an impressive client list including the FBI, Coast Guard and Dunn &amp; Bradstreet, and delivers some progressive integrations, like a deployment of their API gateway for <a title="Blackhawk Network" href="http://www.blackhawknetwork.com/">Blackhawk Network</a>, which extends REST services to their business partners like iTunes and Facebook.</p>
<p>I see all the hardened enterprise services I've seen with existing providers, I think why they may have missed my radar is they lack the open API building blocks like developer portals, app showcases, forums and the self-service partner systems I tend to track on.</p>
<p>Vordel is new to me, it will take some more time to get to know their products and team like I have with existing API management service providers.  As I learn more about Vordel I will share more information about the company, the services they offer, and what makes them stand out from existing landscape of <a title="API Service Providers" href="/serviceproviders/">API service providers</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>
     One of the ways I develop content for this site is by talking through my day to day experiences as an API Evangelist. I feel that talking through what I’m learning in real-time, is the best way to make it stick, while also sharing with the public. There is a lot of value that comes out of my daily learning, and it would be wrong to not share this.
</p>
<p>
     I had someone approach me on LinkedIn today and ask:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>I'm trying to convince my colleagues and managers on the importance of having internal API, not just as a prologue to public API, but also as a way to have cleaner, better-understood interfaces internally for our developers. Do you have any thoughts or tips on the subject?</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     <a title="Internal evangelism" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/09/29/api-evangelism-is-equal-parts-internal,-partner-and-public-outreach/">Internal evangelism</a> is a big part of my role, and I know its something that other API advocates face as they are trying to sell the concept of APIs to decision makers within their company. Testing the water with APIs internally is the best way to get started, and learn what goes into planning, deploying and managing an API.
</p>
<p>
     When trying to sell your bosses on APIs for internal use, I would start with:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Decoupling</strong> - Deploying resources and your data within your company as individual RESTful resources decouple them, allowing them to consumed and managed independently. This kind of of decoupling of data and resources enable more agile scaling, migration and integration into a wide range of organizations and applications across your company. Consider how <a title="consider how API enabled Netflix to move from the data center to the cloud" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/20/apis-power-netflix%E2%80%99s-move-to-cloud-enabling-world-domination/">APIs have enabled Netflix to migrate from the data-center to the cloud</a>, with unprecedented growth simultaneously, and also enabling them to grow globally.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Product Management</strong> - Allocating your companies data and resources as independent RESTful APIs will simplify your product management allowing them to be defined, launched, deployed and even killed off independently of each other. This type of allocation will allow very granular ownership of each product, allowing product managers to own specific APIs or groups of API products, and scale product ownership with new managers as needed.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Organization Interoperability</strong> - APIs enable much more flexible collaboration between different departments that may be geographically or organizational distant. With a growing virtual workforce, this type of interoperability will be key to companies being able to staff up and meet the demands of their growing businesses.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Multi-Use</strong> - APIs will enable your companies resources and data to be used across multiple implementations from internal applications, websites, mobile and tablet devices without building out separate systems.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/blueprints.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     That is where I’d start with selling colleagues and managers on the importance of having internal APIs. APIs can introduce flexibility and agility not only into your IT and development operations, but also introduce a <a title="RESTful Business Architecture" href="/2011/04/09/restful-business-architecture/">RESTful business architecture</a> into your company.
</p>
<p>
     In addition to the benefits APIs will introduce internally, all of this will set the stage for improved business development with your partners and your company will be primed, if and when you are ready to open up your APIs to the public.
</p>
<p>
     <strong>UPDATE:</strong>
</p>
<p>
     The person who contacted me on LinkedIn got back to me with this:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>Thank you. I showed your post to one of the managers here and it actually made him changed his mind. The next step it to persuade we need to use vendors such as 3Scale, Apigee or Mashery instead of building it all by ourselves. </em>

        <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2011</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.data.gov/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/data-gov/Datagov.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.data.gov/" target="_blank">Data.gov</a> for me is like being a kid in a candy store.  My experience with data goes back to High School when I got my first programming job right out of Mr. Smiths computer class.  I built Cobol database for use by school districts in the State of Oregon, jump-starting my career as a programmer.  Ever since I&rsquo;ve had an obsession with data, and specifically with government data, and <a title="trying to make sense how government operates" href="http://oregonbudget.laneworks.net/" target="_blank">trying to make sense of how our government operates</a>.</p>
<p>I have been playing with various data-sets at Data.gov since they launched, but today I finally spent some time evaluating their approach to delivering the Data.gov ecosystem.  It is a pretty robust approach to opening up our government, agency by agency.</p>
<p>The Data.gov sites centers around data-sets available by agency, category and topics, with the ability to view as raw data, files &amp; documents, charts, maps, calendars, filtered views and interactive data-sets.  Data is made available in a wide range of formats including .csv, .xls, .xml, .rdf, .kml and .shp files when each format applies.</p>
<p>Data.gov is not just for developers, many of the data-sets are available in interactive formats, as well as a wide variety of applications, making the data accessible and usable by anyone.   A couple examples of applications include <a title="product recalls" href="http://explore.data.gov/Wholesale-and-Retail-Trade/All-Product-Recalls/ezdk-xtg7" target="_blank">product recalls</a>, <a title="travel warnings" href="http://explore.data.gov/National-Security-and-Veterans-Affairs/Travel-Warnings/hkvp-3krc" target="_blank">travel warnings</a> and <a title="hospital compare" href="http://explore.data.gov/Social-Insurance-and-Human-Services/Hospital-Compare/g4a8-s9zu" target="_blank">hospital compare</a>.  What really makes these apps valuable, is the data-sets are usually available alongside, so if you want to dive in deeper and use the data in other ways, you can.</p>
<p>Since Data.gov is a the top level site for the open data initiative, there is an obvious need to break it down into some smaller communities.  These communities include:</p>
<p><a title="Energy" href="http://www.data.gov/communities/energy" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/data-gov/Energy-Data-Gov.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Energy" href="http://www.data.gov/communities/energy" target="_blank">Energy</a></strong> - Data, tools, apps, challenges, resources, blog, forums centered around energy data, meant to facilitate public discussion of and awareness on our Nation&rsquo;s energy activity.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Health" href="http://www.data.gov/communities/health" target="_blank">Health</a></strong> - Data, apps, blog and forum centered around health and health care, intended to help the public make better informed decisions about their health.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Law" href="http://www.data.gov/communities/law" target="_blank">Law</a></strong> - Data and tools providing administrative decisions, case filings, legal interpretations and agency directives from the Executive Branch for legal professionals, researchers, the business community and the general public.</li>
</ul>
<p>The energy, health and law communities at Data.gov represent different areas of our government.  I&rsquo;m assuming they will add education, with data from <a title="data.ed.gov" href="http://data.ed.gov/" target="_blank">data.ed.gov</a> as a community in the near future.  There is a &ldquo;learn&rdquo; section off the home page of Data.gov, but it doesn&rsquo;t have the community building tools the other areas have, with just links to external sites and resources.</p>
<p>There are two other communities, that are more focused on technology, as opposed to areas of our government:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Open Data" href="http://www.data.gov/communities/opendata" target="_blank">Open Data</a></strong> - Blog, forum and Twitter stream dedicate to the concept of open data and the government, and the community being built around it.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Semantic Web" href="http://www.data.gov/communities/semantic" target="_blank">Semantic Web</a></strong> - Apps, blog and forums dedicated to evolving linked data amongst the Data.gov open data initiative. </li>
</ul>
<p><a title="Environmental and Compliance Data" href="http://explore.data.gov/Geography-and-Environment/EPA-Enforcement-and-Compliance-History-Online-ECHO/c8kh-iqih" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/data-gov/Environmental-Compliance-Data.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There is one more community called <strong>"<a title="Restore the Gulf" href="http://www.data.gov/restorethegulf" target="_blank">Restore the Gulf</a>"</strong>, which is focused around the specific issue that we are facing down in the Gulf of Mexico.  Hopefully it is the start of a third type of Data.gov community that can address various issues our country faces, pulling together data, tools and resources to build a community to address the issue.</p>
<p>I can see the work that went into building community around the areas of government, technology and issues, but as its coming together it still looks a little disjointed, with learning not really coming together as an actual education community and &ldquo;developers corner&rdquo; off the home page ending up linking to the open data community, creating a little redundancy.  Its a great effort to bring together community, with just a little more structure, and presence, the site can really deliver on this vision.</p>
<p>There are other sections tying together the site like an <a title="about page" href="http://www.data.gov/about" target="_blank">about page</a>, <a title="frequently asked questions" href="http://www.data.gov/faq">frequently asked questions</a> and <a title="contact information" href="http://www.data.gov/contact">contact information</a>.   Data.gov also addresses <a title="data policy" href="http://www.data.gov/datapolicy">data</a> and <a title="privacy policy" href="http://www.data.gov/privacypolicy">privacy</a> with policy pages and even speaks to <a title="accessibility" href="http://www.data.gov/accessibility">accessibility</a> which is something you don&rsquo;t see in many data and API ecosystems.  There are also <a title="tutorials" href="http://www.data.gov/developers#TB_inline?height=200&amp;width=400&amp;inlineId=tb_external">tutorials</a>, <a title="videos" href="http://www.data.gov/developers#TB_inline?height=200&amp;width=400&amp;inlineId=tb_external">videos</a> and a <a title="whats new" href="http://www.data.gov/whatsnew">whats new</a> section providing other resources to get everyone understanding the vision, how to use the resources available, as well as keeping users engaged with any new announcements.</p>
<p>The site does a great job showcasing applications and important data-sets with a gallery, also using feature displays on the home page and within community pages.  These are great for exposing some of the great data-sets and applications available within the site.  This kind of discovery is very important to introducing users to whats available without feeling overwhelmed by the large amounts of data available.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/data-gov/Featured-Tool.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Overall Data.gov does an amazing job of delivering huge amounts of quality government data-sets in very usable formats, making it interactive and providing applications for working with the data.  There are also APIs available for accessing the data, which is extremely important in empowering developers to build web an mobile applications, crunch data and build visualizations that shedding light into how our government operates, increasing participation.  The Data.gov platform and APIs are delivered by a service provider called <a title="Socrata" href="http://www.socrata.com/" target="_blank">Socrata</a>.  I will provide more coverage of the APIs and Socrata after I work with them a little more, and gain a better understanding of how they work.</p>
<p>A lot of effort has been put into building community around the Data.gov initiative, but as I mentioned in my last post about <a title="Bringing Awareness to Data.Gov with Grassroots Evangelism" href="/2011/10/24/bringing-awareness-to-data-gov-with-grassroots-evangelism/" target="_blank">bringing awareness to Data.gov with grassroots evangelism</a>, I think there is a lot more to do in making sure people everywhere are aware Data.gov exists and do a little more to bring them to the site, by reaching out to the online communities where they already exists, like <a title="Github" href="http://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>, <a title="Stack Exchange" href="http://stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">Stack Exchange</a> and <a title="Hacker News" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>, participating in their community, listening, joining and taking part in their world.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/data-gov/digital-town-hall.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>There is a lot that can be done online to create awareness around the resources our government is making available, but a robust online presence is not enough.  There needs to be a grassroots effort to bring Data.gov to every small town, engaging the public within each community via schools, libraries and other community gathering places--make them aware of the rich resources our government has exposed and challenge them to come together and help us find the answers that make our government operate more efficiently.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.data.gov/" target="_blank">Data.gov</a> is a an excellent start, next we need to increase our governments presence online and offline, creating the feedback loop that will bring developers, data scientists and our brightest minds together within the communities available at Data.gov and beyond.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2011</span>

<p>As the number of APIs grow, the number of ways in which API owners control and incentivize their developers ecosystems evolves.    <a title="APIs are your business development platform" href="/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">APIs are your business development 2.0 platform</a>, and it is up to you to tailor your services to incentivize your developers as well as control API usage to meet your business goals.</p>
<p>One emerging way to control API consumption to meet your business goals is through a balance between pricing and <a title="Terms of Service" href="/buildingblocks/terms_of_use__conditions.php">terms of service (TOS)</a>.    By offering branding opportunities to developers that they can deploy alongside the content and resources they consume via your API, you can easily turn your developer community into an extension of your marketing department.</p>
<p>Price breaks can be offered to developers who extend your brand, encouraging them to build a business around your API content and resources as long as it adds value to your brand.  API consumers who opt not to take part in branding, can be charged more, adding value to your company purely as revenue opportunity.</p>
<p><a title="Branding" href="/buildingblocks/branding.php">Branding</a> and pricing controls are a growing way to ensure your API adds value to your company either as revenue or brand syndication, but another way some content and data API providers are finding success, is through a contribution incentive.  Just like brand extension, API contribution gives developers an opportunity to participate deeper and receive price breaks, while also be encouraged to contribute content back to an API, enriching content and add valuable information back to your companies API.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-monetization.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Writeable APIs can be made available allowing developers to contribute user reviews, comments, annotations or even correct and update content that originated from your company. Proper service and key management around your API,  allows you to track which users contribute content back to your system.  As a result of this participation you can offer further price breaks in the form of credits, or even end up paying customers for their content contributions.</p>
<p>Incentivizing and controlling API usage through brand, pricing and contribution may not work for every API, but it offers some interesting opportunities for publishers and API owners to develop new forms of self-service, business development relationships around their API ecosystems.</p>

     <a title="Data.gov" href="http://explore.data.gov/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/data-gov/Datagov.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I just finished a four week roadshow that included three <a title="Startup Weekend" href="http://startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a> EDU events -- one in Seattle, one in San Francisco and one in Washington DC -- as well as two versions of the <a title="Business of APIs Conference" href="http://apiconference.com/">Business of APIs conferences</a> -- one in San Francisco and one in New York City.
</p>
<p>
     It might not seem at first glance that these events had much in common. During the Startup Weekends, business people, teachers and developers rallied to build startups that focused on solving problems in education, while the Business of APIs conferences showcased businesses telling their stories about how opening up data and APIs have transformed them and made them more competitive within their respective industries.
</p>
<p>
     Both events re-enforced for me the importance of both on-the-ground and online evangelism. Both are necessary for ensuring the success of open data and APIs.
</p>
<p>
     At both series of events, I encountered many people who had never heard of <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a> or <a title="Amazon Web Services" href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> -- two API providers that are leaders in their industries (as well as were sponsors at the events). Both Twilio and Amazon Web Services provide essential cloud resources that can be used by any company and developer, but without the proper awareness and education, these resources go unused. Both companies are active in sponsoring start-up weekends, hackathons, codeathons, meetups and the like, but Twilio does much better at having "boots on the ground" at these events. This presence is one of the things that has made Twilio a developer favorite and, in turn, spawned thousands of apps and many start-ups. But clearly they still have work to do to get their name "out there," particularly at events outside of Silicon Valley.
</p>
<p>
     But having someone on-the-ground isn't always enough. At the Startup Weekend EDU events, for example, there were several people present from the Department of Education and to their credit, they spent the entire time engaging and listening to business people, teachers and developers about what they needed. That was great to see, but at the same time, but there were no materials there about the amazing data and APIs provided by the Department of Education at data.ed.gov and no real encouragement of developers to take advantage of these things.
</p>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/data-gov/data_gov_open.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     It seems as though we are missing the opportunity to help people become familiar with the various resources that the <a title="Department of Education" href="http://data.ed.gov/">Department of Ed</a> (along with its parent <a title="Data.gov" href="http://explore.data.gov/">data.gov</a> site) offers. As code-athons and other startup-building events continue to spread, it seems a shame to not take better advantage of these tools.
</p>
<p>
     The tech companies do send out their developer advocates and evangelists to "get the word out." Facebook, Google, Twitter, Twilio and the like all have an <a title="army of these sorts of people" href="http://code.google.com/team/">army of these sorts of people</a> to help others work with their data and their APIs.
</p>
<p>
     Now that the government has opened its data, it seems as though the missing piece might be this evangelism element -- taking the open data on the road, from town to town, making the wealth of resources available at <a title="data.gov" href="http://explore.data.gov/">data.gov</a> known and challenging some of our brightest minds to get involved to make our country a better place.

</p>
<p>
     Last spring when I started writing for <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, my first post was "<a title="Everything Site Should Be An API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/04/06/everything-should-be-an-api-says-fcc/">Everything Should Be an API," Says FCC.</a> The story was about the new FCC web site, that was built entirely on top of RESTful APIs using the Drupal platform.
</p>
<p>
     Since that post, I met the company behind the <a title="FCC Website" href="http://www.fcc.gov/">FCC website</a> redesign, <a title="Seaborne Inc." href="http://seabourneinc.com/">Seabourne Inc.</a>, which builds some pretty innovative solutions using Drupal, employing APIs in everything they do. As part of the FCC.gov website project, Seabourne Inc. built a module for Drupal that leverages the platform for content publishing, powered by APIs.
</p>
<p>
     <a title="Seaborne Inc." href="http://www.fcc.gov/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/fcc/FCC-Logo.jpg" alt=" width=" width="135" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I spoke with Mike Reich, the CEO of Seabourne Inc. about APIs, he is as passionate about APIs as I am, but has identified the best place to start when it comes to opening up the government, is with content APIs instead of just focusing on data APIs.
</p>
<p>
     He’s right. In the rush to open up government data, many of us overlook the huge archives and content generated on a daily basis by our government. Recently, many government agencies are adopting Drupal as a content management platform, and using Seaborne’s Content API for Drupal, any agency or organization can make content openly accessible via an API.
</p>
<p>
     Their Content APIs can instantly make content from an agencies website available for other agencies to access in a self-service way, reducing the resources needed for inter-departmental coordination. In addition to making external coordination more efficient, it can make rolling out separate web sites, applications and mobile apps much more cost efficient as well.
</p>
<p>
     <a title="Seaborne Inc." href="http://seabourneinc.com/projects/contentapi/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/seabourne-inc/Content-API-Drupal-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     <a title="Content APIs" href="http://seabourneinc.com/projects/contentapi/">Content APIs</a> can also open content to the public allowing media, companies and even individuals to pull content and mash it up, evolve, derive meaning and stories from it that a government agency may not have time or even perspective to do. In my opinion this type of content access by the public truly reflects the next generation of democracy, allowing anyone to get involved in government, even demonstrating better ways to understand how government operates.
</p>
<p>
     You can access the <a title="Content API for Drupal" href="http://seabourneinc.com/projects/contentapi/">Content API for Drupal</a> on the Seaborne Inc. website, I’m installing a prototype Drupal website so I can play with the API, helping me understand whats possible when using Drupal in conjunction with the Content API.

        <span class="post-date">20 Oct 2011</span>
        <p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/self-service.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     At a recent presentation at the <a title="Business of APIs Conference in San Francisco" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/10/06/business-of-apis-conference-in-san-francisco-wrapup/">Business of API conference in San Francisco</a>, Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson argued that two of the ways APIs can be successful in courting new developers are by being self-service and by having a "freemium" option. Both of these features empower developers to start using an API right away, without entering a credit card, talking to customer service, sales or having to wait for budget approval. They can just sign-up, get a key and start hacking!
</p>
<p>
     This shouldn't just be a model for APIs targeting the public developers; it can work with the enterprise as well. This model would allow enterprise developers to get up and running using an API quickly, building their own working prototypes, and in turn, using this prototype to make a case for why a company should use an API -- all without talking to their boss or getting approval.
</p>
<p>
     Of course, an API can still have a traditional sales funnel, where developers can get support, pay for premium services, and engage to get appropriate SLAs. But by providing both a self-service and a freemium option, there is the potential to reach new customers -- customers that may not respond to a traditional enterprise software sales cycle.
</p>
<p>
     I strongly believe that both self-service and freemium have a place with all APIs. These help expose what is needed for developers to see the value an API delivers so they can prove this value to their company; then later, they can engage sales and business departments to strengthen and harden the relationship.
</p>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/freepremium.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     This approach is gaining acceptance and can be seen across many of the successful APIs in the space, like Twilio Self-Service and freemium pricing are things that all the major API service providers (<a title="3Scale" href="/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a> and <a href="/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a>) endorse when they advise their customers during setup of their own APIs.
</p>
<p>
     APIs open entirely new channels, attract new customers, and encourage the development of new ways of doing business you could never even imagine on your own! Right? Yet only 3Scale and Mashape actually offer truly self-service, freemium options for their API management platforms. At <a href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> I've deployed entirely new APIs I can't get internal resources for, and I've done so using both 3Scale and Mashape. With their platforms I've built new <a title="document printing APIs" href="http://mimeoconnect.3scale.net/">document printing APIs</a>. I launched these without the help of IT. By doing so, I’m attracting new users and in turn evangelizing internally at <a href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> to get greater buy-in and budgets -- all without engaging with sales, spending money, or getting my budget' approval.
</p>
<p>
     The enterprise can learn a lot from open APIs. Idon't think the traditional enterprise sales process is all bad; it has its place, but it doesn't offer the transparency that is needed in many cases, and where I think many businesses feel they are protecting their intellectual property and delivering a stronger product, they are actually missing the boat on a lot of new business.

        <span class="post-date">18 Oct 2011</span>
        <p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-REST-URL.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     Someone asked me recently for some advice regarding what they should consider when constructing the URL and endpoints for their RESTful API.  I thought I’d share the advice I passed along.
</p>
<p>
     I don't intend this to be a comprehensive guide to building URLs for a true REST API, just some things to consider for the newbie API product manager who may not have a hardcore REST developer on their team.
</p>
<p>
     When planning your endpoints for a RESTful API, there are 3 things I tell people to consider:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Domain</strong> - Put your API at a separate domain or sub-domain than your website.  It will make it easier to migrate and scale, and your IT team will thank you.  For example: 
          <ul class="mainlist">
               <li>
                    <a href="https://api.yourdomain.com">https://api.yourdomain.com</a>
               </li>
          </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Versioning</strong> - Make sure and consider the versioning of your API in your URL structure.  How you version will depend on the preferences of your dev team, the most common patterns I see are a v preceding the version number of your API or using year and month of the version.  How often you release may impact your decision.  For example:
          <ul class="mainlist">
               <li>
                    <a href="https://api.peoplebrowsr.com/v1/"><span>https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/</span></a>
               </li>
               <li>
                    <a href="https://api.peoplebrowsr.com/2011/11/"><span>https://api.yourdomain.com/2011/11/</span></a>
               </li>
          </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Resources</strong> - The next part of your URL should be the resource of what you are offering.  Make it self-describing of the resource you are offering through the endpoint.  Make it reflect what a developer is looking to consume when using your API.  For example:
          <ul class="mainlist">
               <li>
                    <a href="https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/articles/"><span>https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/</span><span>article/</span></a>
               </li>
               <li>
                    <a href="https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/users/"><span>https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/</span><span>user/</span></a>
               </li>
          </ul>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     How you define your API resources is very important, its something you will have to live with forever.  Make your resource descriptions count, your developers will thank you.
</p>
<p>
     The other thing I strong urge is to offer SSL for your API from day one.  Its not a huge problem down the road, but any change will come with issues, and many of your developers will request and even require SSL in some cases, before they integrate with your API.
</p>
<p>
     That is all the general advice I have, how you describe your resources is up to you, and how RESTful you make the rest of your API is up to your dev team.  I don't get involved in the religious REST arguments, I leave that for the experts.  I just wanted share some of the common things you should consider when constructing your URL endpoints.
</p>
<p>
     Let me know anything I'm missing you REST geeks!

<p>
     <a title="USA Today" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/">USA Today</a> has announced that they now support the commercial access of articles, reviews and census data through their content APIs.
</p>
<p>
     Any developer can request a key, and start making calls for free, with initial calls being restricted at a default rate. But as applications prove successful they are now willing to increase usage caps on a case-by-case basis. USA Today doesn’t describe what its commercial pricing will be, but they state in their <a title="Terms and Conditions" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/API_Terms_of_Use">terms and conditions</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
     If USAT decides to charge a fee for use of or access to the USAT APIs, such fees will be disclosed to you prior to USAT charging such fees to you.
</blockquote>
<p>
     Every couple of months USA Today rolls out a new API or evolution in their business model, as they get more comfortable with their API. This latest move seems to seems to be centered around encouraging commercial of its census data, which the NY Times makes available for commercial use as well.
</p>
<p>
     Its interesting to watch these media giants evolve their business models using APIs to make themselves more competitive.

     <a title="NASA just launched a new Data API" href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/10/12/announcing-the-data-nasa-gov-api/">NASA just launched a new Data API</a> around its online archive of <a title="NASA data sets" href="http://data.nasa.gov/">NASA data sets</a>, that they launched back in August. The data.nasa.gov API provides a RESTful interface, with responses in JSON for the NASA data archives.
</p>
<p>
     The new <a title="NASA Data API" href="http://data.nasa.gov/api-info/">NASA Data API</a> is part of the ongoing <a title="NASA Government Data Plan" href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/index.html">NASA Open Government Plan</a>, providing access to data sets in a variety of categories including aeronautics, climate, earth science, engineering, institutional, life sciences, operations and space sciences.
</p>
<p>
     There is a wealth of data available at data.nasa.gov. The APIs make it easier to access this data, but they are just data APIs. There is a huge opportunity for someone to abstract more meaningful, focused APIs delivering just photos of the moon, weather or climate change related data.
</p>
<p>
     <a title="NASA just launched a new Data API" href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/10/12/announcing-the-data-nasa-gov-api/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/nasa/nasa-data-gov-old-computer.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     For example, a developer looking to get earth, moon and other planetary photographs, can find what they are looking for in the data.nasa.gov data sets, but they have to navigate the different categories and build the proper requests to get exactly what they are looking for. Some developers are willing to go through this trouble, while others are not, and will give up quickly.
</p>
<p>
     There is opportunity for someone to deploy a earth photo API, moon photo API and mars photo API for example. These APIs would provide quick access API interfaces around specific and meaningful collections. Developers could quickly build calls pulling the information they need, while non-developers could also syndicate and share using widgets and other embeddable tools.
</p>
<p>
     Its great to see government agencies not only making data available, but deploying APIs making the data easier to access. But there are more opportunities to derive more meaning, and identify new opportunities around these rich archives of data.

</p>
<p>
     The APIs that make up X.Commerce are:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">

     </li>
     <li>
          <a href="https://www.x.com/developers/ebay"><strong>eBay</strong></a> - The hardened suite of search, trading and buying APIs from the popular auction platform that was one of the <a title="early pioneers of the web API space" href="/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">early pioneers in the web API space</a>.
     </li>
     <li>
          <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/"><strong>Magento</strong></a> - The API allows access to the Customer, Catalog and Order modules of any users Magento E-Commerce account.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/10/08/unlocking-government-data-with-socrata/">Unlocking Government Data with Socrata</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">08 Oct 2011</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.socrata.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/socrata/Socrata-Open-Data-Company.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was introduced to the API service provider <a title="Socrata" href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a> last week.  Socrata has a government data platform that exceeds anything I&rsquo;ve envisioned.  In the past, I have said that <a title="Every State Should Have an API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/09/06/every-city-should-have-an-api-lets-start-with-watertown-ma/">every state should have an API</a>.&nbsp;Socrata looks like that platform.</p>
<p>Socrata says it best:  <em>&ldquo;Social Data Discovery Solution Promotes Civic Engagement, Improves Decision and Policy Making, and Achieves Government Transparency.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Socrata defines "<a title="Social Data Discovery" href="http://www.socrata.com/discover/">Social Data Discovery</a>" as a solution for public and private institutions to transform raw data, contained in large departmental databases, and deploy using the latest web and API technologies. &nbsp;According to Socrata:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Social Data Discovery promotes civic engagement, enabling an online community of journalists, policy makers, scientists/domain experts, and citizens to visualize data and engage in discussion with one another. Together, audiences with disparate viewpoints  can analyze and discover insights from datasets, improving decision and  policy making.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>They seems to get the political, technical and economic challenges faced when delivering government data solutions, and provide a very comprehensive solution for city, county, state and federal agencies to manage their data:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Data-Set On-Boarding</strong> - A process, acknowledging the need to clean and transform data so its accessible by an external audience.</li>
<li><strong>Web APIs </strong>- Ability to deploy RESTful APIs with for data sets with a key for authentication. </li>
<li><strong>Datasets and Feeds </strong>- Availablity of datasets in common formats like CSV, TSV, XML, KML,  and Atom.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - The platform appears to deliver necessary resources for iPhone, Android, and Blackery mobile platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong> - Socrata appears to offer many of the essential API maangement services as other providers.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong> - Provides the necessary reporting and analytics to make sense of how data is being consumed and distributed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with trying to get data from government agencies, is often that you end up with PDF and MIcrosoft Excel reports, and not the quality data feeds and APIs developers need.  In my post, &ldquo;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/09/06/every-city,-county-and-state-should-have-an-api/">Every City, County and State Should Have an API</a>&rdquo;, I identify that government workers are only working with the tools we give them.   They need better tools.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.socrata.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/socrata/Socrata-Data-Overview.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>Socrata looks like just the tool for the job.  Socrata appears to have all the key elements that government agencies will need to manage, publish and share important data with other agencies and the public using &ldquo;Social Data Discovery&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;m thoroughly impressed with what they&rsquo;ve delivered for our government in the form of <a title="Data.gov" href="http://explore.data.gov/">Data.gov</a>.  They also provide solutions for <a title="Medicare" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/medicare/">MediCare</a>, <a title="State of Oregon" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/state-of-oregon/">State of Oregon</a>, <a title="State of Oklahoma" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/state-of-oklahoma/">State of Oklahoma</a>, <a title="City of Seattle" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/city-of-seattle/">City of Seattle</a> and <a title="City of Chicago" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/city-of-chicago/">City of Chicago</a>, among others.</p>
<p>This is just my first look at the platform.  I will be spending more time evaluating what they offer.  If you&rsquo;d like to understand Socrata better, I recommend starting with the <a title="solutions tour" href="http://www.socrata.com/solutions/solution-tour/">solutions tour</a>, then downloading their <a title="product white paper" href="http://socrata.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Socrata_Social_Data_Discovery-Government.pdf?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonuKzOZKXonjHpfsX%2B6%2BwtXrHr08Yy0EZ5VunJEUWy2YMDT9QhcOuuEwcWGog80wNbCOGBfQ%3D%3D">product white paper</a>.</p>
