{% include JB/setup %}<p>Palo Alto has opened up city data, including operational data about the Palo Alto City Library.Using the Palo Alto City open data portal you can access machine-readable data sets about various aspects of library operations including visitor count, checkouts by type of materia, information and circulation services, programs attendance, website visitors count and how library funds are spent.The Palo Alto open data portal provides widgets with data grids and charts derived from data.But you can alsoÂ request data sets and access data via the City of Palo Altos API.The city hopes that it will increase community engagement by making data open and machine readable by default.</p>
