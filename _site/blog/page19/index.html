			<p><em>04 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>
It is a new year, and we have a lot of work to do when it comes to defining APIs in the new year. One of the results of 2015, was that the specification known as Swagger was spun off into the Linux Foundation, where for the remaining of the year we were simply calling it the Open API Definition Format (OADF)--quite a mouthful.
In 2016, a name as been given to the specification--OpenAPI Spec. If you know me, you know how I feel on all of this, but in 2016, I am focusing on whats next, not what just happened, so I am just happy there is a name, not some intermediary WTF. Soooo, head over to the new Github repo home for OpenAPI Spec, and get involved.
If you are planning on doing anything cool with the OpenAPI Spec, please reach out and let me know. Now that we have forward motion with the specification, and a name we can ALL use, I will be assembling a new toolbox dedicated to the spec, and all the cool things y'all are doing with it. As I look forward across the 2016 API horizon, I have no doubt that the OpenAPI Spec will be essential to the next wave of growth in the API sector.

			<p><em>04 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>
A road map for your API, is one of those essential building blocks that can go a long way in building trust with your API consumers. Sharing your plans, helps developers prepare for the future, and better plan for their own road maps, keeping everything potentially in sync.&nbsp;
From my vantage point, a simple, up to date, easily found road map is a building block that benefits both API provider and consumer. Road maps help provider organize their plans, and figure out how they are going to communicate it with the ecosystem, then setting the overall tone for how API consumers will engaging with a platform--both good and bad.
During my regular monitoring of the space, I saw that Microsoft released a pretty slick "Cloud Platform Roadmap", which is yet another sign for me on how Microsoft is stepping up their cloud (API) game. Their interactive road map allows you browse the roadmap by areas like cloud infrastructure or Internet of Things (IoT), and see features that are&nbsp;recently available, public preview, in development, cancelled, or have been archived.
Beyond the core functionality of the road map, I'm impressed that they published a blog post telling why they did it, acknowledging that it will bring visibility into platform operations. Additionally there is a prominent button, providing an email address where you can send your suggestions for the road map, providing evidence of how a roadmap can contribute to the overall feedback loop for an API platform.
Overall, I like the simplicity of the Microsoft cloud platform road map, and it is definitely a healthy building block I'd encourage other API providers to consider offering as well. I'm going to make sure Microsoft's roadmap is one of the examples I cite along the API management line, as part of my overall API life cycle map.&nbsp;

			<p><em>04 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>Last week I was playing with&nbsp;defining API monitoring APIs so I can map to each stop along the API life cycle. I took three of the API monitoring services I use (APIMetrics, API Science, and Runscope), and like I do for other areas along the API life cycle, and for common API stacks, I profiled their APIs using the OpenAPI Spec. This is standard operating procedure for any of my research areas, in that part of profiling each company's operations, I profile the API surface area in detail. For each of my research projects, I will include this listing of each API endpoint available as part of the work. As I was adding one for my API monitoring research, I had a thought--I wanted to reorganize the endpoints, across the three API monitoring service providers, and group them by tag. So I started playing with a new way to look at the APIs available in any given APIs.json driven collection. This is a listing of API resources available in&nbsp;this projects APIs.json, organized by tag.

			<p><em>04 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>
As the number of API definitions increases out there, I'm coming across many duplicates of APIs I already have in my collection(s). In 2016, I will increasingly need to be able to execute a diff on two OpenAPI Spec or API Blueprint files, and get back a programmatic, as well as a visual reference, which allows me to quickly understand the differences between each spec in detail.
In support of this API definition diff tooling, I can also see the potential for some sort of merging tooling, that would allow me to easily say yes or no, and merge various elements of either API definitions. I recently got sucked into using Ancestry.com, and they provide a nice way to merge discovered documents into your family tree, accepting or rejecting what you want--I would like to see this exist for API definitions.
As with every other other of the almost 1000 building blocks available across my API research, each element of the API life cycle should be available as an API, as well as lightweight, open source, micro tool. An API definition diff and merge would make to very viable API services, and if someone doesn't get around to building, I will probably get to work on a version of it for my own needs. I have a growing queue of API definitions I need to merge with my master stack, and not all of it is as straightforward as "accept all".&nbsp;
In addition to adding attribution to my API definition research, I'm adding diff and merge as building blocks. They'll provide a reminder for me (and anyone else), that attribution, diff, and merging at the API definition level is an important aspect of the API life cycle.

			<p><em>04 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>I have done a lot of work hand crafting, and often scrape crafting, machine readable OpenAPI Spec, as part of the work on the API Stack. Creating a usable API definition is a lot of work, making it is a pretty valuable commodity, in contrast to my strong opinion that they should be readily available for EVERY API today. While there is still a HUGE AMOUNT of work to be done, I feel like the ball is beginning to move forward, when it comes to the number of publicly available API definitions.&nbsp; For the API economy to work at the scale we all have pictured in our head, the surface area of ALL APIs, and its supporting operations needs to be defined, and available to consumers and service providers. Every API should have an OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, and Postman Collection available for consumers to put to work. As we close 2015, I'm happy to say that I am optimistic about the amount of work others across the space are putting into API definitions, like the folks over at API Guru--who are discovering, improving upon, and validating API definitions in a variety of formats, all available on Github. A lot of work goes into crafting these definitions, and it is good to see them investing in this area. Their valuable index of almost 200 API definitions is being used to power Any API, and is complete with&nbsp;a JSON index for the API collection. Keep an eye on it, as it is growing every day--I know that I will be closely watching every commit to the open API definition repository. As I look through their collection, there are many APIs I already have, but there are many others I would love to build upon the work done by API Guru--just as I encourage others to do with my API Stack work.&nbsp; All of this forces me to consider, as this new API definition layer of the...[<a href="/2016/01/04/api-definition-origin-validation-and-attribution/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>04 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>Z (@zdne) over at Apiary published a pretty interesting blog post before christmas&nbsp;which highlights two important elements of profiling APIs using popular API definition formats. Z is key to the vision behind API Blueprint, one of the top 3 API definition formats, that are fueling API design in 2016.&nbsp; Giving The Body Some LoveOne common complaint I've seen on forums, issue threads, and other places API developers hang out, is that OpenAPI Spec does not allow for properly describing the request body payload. I definitely agree with this, but is something that doesn't often impact me, as the type of APIs I am currently deploying, rarely employ a very complex body payload. However I do know some APIs that I've documented, where if you can't properly define the body, the API appears to have no value whatsoever, when described using an&nbsp;OpenAPI Spec. It was good to hear Z state that, "In 2015, we have spent most of the year building only one feature--the description of body parameters. This feature is also know as the MSON syntax." Acknowledging Media TypesThe next significant area Apiary is addressing with API Blueprint and MSON, is when it comes to supporting multiple media types, and making sure they are properly described in the API definition--MSON FTW!&nbsp; Z talks about how, "MSON isn't another syntax for JSON. MSON is agnostic to serialization media types. With MSON, I can describe the data and defer the decision whether they will be send as JSON, XML or HAL over the wire." I will be learning more&nbsp;MSON&nbsp;in January, and reacquainting myself with API Blueprint, as I document my APIs stack(s), but also specifically two of my APIs that provide JSON, HTML, and Siren media types. Hopefully this will allow me to also document the growing number of hypermedia APIs available across the space. Media types, and body are two areas that OpenAPI Spec (aka Swagger) is deficient. Something that gives Apiary a pretty interesting head...[<a href="/2016/01/04/api-blueprint-has-been-evolving-in-two-critical-areas-where-openapi-spec-aka-swagger-falls-significantly-short/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>03 Jan 2016</em></p>
			<p>This is my walk-through of the concepts involved with the monetization of public data using APIs. In this work I am not advocating that companies should be mindlessly profiting from publicly available data, my intent is to provide a framework for organizations to think through the process of generating revenue from commercial access to public data, acknowledging that it costs money to aggregate, serve up, and keep data up to date and usable for the greater public good--if public data is not accessible, accurate, and up to date it is of no use to anyone. I have long argued that companies and even government agencies should be able to charge for commercial access to public&nbsp;data and be able to generate revenue to cover operational costs, and even produce much-needed funds that can be applied to the road map. My work in this has been referenced in existing projects,&nbsp;such as the Department of Interior and Forest Service looking to generate revenue from commercial access and usage of public data generated&nbsp;by&nbsp;the national parks systems. In my opinion, this conversation around generating revenue from publicly available digital assets should be occurring right alongside the existing conversations that already are going on around publicly available physical assets. Building Upon The Monetization Strategies Of Leading Cloud ProvidersMy thoughts around generating revenue from public open data is built upon monitoring the strategies of leading online platforms like Amazon Web Services, Google, and others. In 2001 a new approach to providing access to digital resources began to emerge from Internet companies like Amazon and Salesforce, and by 2016, it has become a common way for companies to do business online, providing metered, secure access to valuable corporate and end-users data, content, and other algorithmic resources. This research looks to combine these practices into a single guide that public data stewards can consider as they look to fund their important work. Do not get me wrong, there are many practices of leading tech...[<a href="/2016/01/03/thinking-about-the-monetization-layer-for-public-data/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>My new partner in API crime Cloud Elements is helping motivate me to spend more cycles in 2016 on defining specific stacks of APIs, as part of my ongoing API industry research. I am taking the approach I've honed over the last five years in my core research, and continuing to push forward on specific areas of the API industry. Cloud Elements calls their aggregated APIs -- Hubs, because they are working to aggregate them into actual usable APIs. My approach is meant to organize common API definitions, into specific groups. I do not go as far as aggregating APIs into a single API, and providing a platform, and tooling for you to actually work with the APIs.&nbsp; Cloud Elements currently has 11 business API hubs defined, where I'm looking to push the space forward by defining 50 stacks: social messaging users storage compute documents commerce payments photos videos music audio voice search content language news travel geo mapping places businesses links events weather movies advertising accounting shipping government (city) government (state) government (fed) home auto transportation wearables energy space healthcare environment education libraries university (faculty) university (student) sharing economy banking 3d printing internet of things drones machine learning I am not in the business of pushing the overall number of APIs forward in the API space--this number means nothing to me in 2016. I am looking to better define what the most valuable APIs are, in some of the most meaningful areas of the Internet. Some of the areas I chose because they are core to web and mobile application development, others because they are important areas to the overall economy and society, with others just because they are frick'n cool! You can see my earlier work in this area, present under the verticals section on the home page of API Evangelist, with my early look at the payment API space, and more recent email, SMS, and MMS research projects.

			<p><em>30 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>When it comes to keeping an eye on what others are doing across the API space, and occasionally pushing forward a few crazy ideas, API Evangelist is your source. However if you really want to learn about API design and architecture, that you can put to work at your company, organization, institution, and government agency--the API Academy is where you go. There is not another team API team that so focused on API literacy, with as much expertise, as the API Academy team. If you have been to any of the leading API events like APIStrat, APIDays, API Craft, and RESTFEst, you've seen their team in action, and known what they are bringing to the table. Mike Amundsen (@mamund) is making sure we are all on the correct path. Ronnie Mitra (@mitraman) is pushing the concept of API design forward. Matt McLarty (@MattMcLartyBC) with the big enterprise API architecture picture. Irakli Nadareishvili (@inadarei) is paying attention to the overall API vision. I have learned a great deal of what I know about API design and architecture from these individuals, during my tenure as the API Evangelist. When it comes to the business or politics of APIs I'm on solid ground, but when it comes to API design, and API architectural considerations at scale--I will always defer to the API Academy. The team informed me, that they are looking for someone to join their team. Someone worthy. Which is no small task. I can barely count on two hands, the number of people who I would recommend for the position, sadly many are already happily working on existing projects. Good thing there are many folks I do not know as well across the space, who are API leaders--if you are one of these people, and thrive on teaching others about API design and architecture, I suggest you ping Matt McLarty over at the API Academy...they need your help!

			<h3><a href="/2015/12/29/the-hard-work-when-it-comes-to-defining-apis/">The Hard Work When It Comes To Defining APIs</a></h3>
			<p><em>29 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am stopping and collecting some of my thoughts, as I work through my API stack. I'm thinking about the more difficult aspects of defining APIs, this time it is for the APIs I depend on to operate my own company. I am working to define the APIs I depend on from over 30 companies, partly to help me better understand the APIs I use, but also partly as theater here for API Evangelist. To profile APIs, I use OADF and APIs.json as my machine readable definition formats. Not all APIs are created equal, so it takes different approaches to crafting their OADF, from doing it by hand for the easier ones, to scrape scripts that take consistent (static) documentation, and generate an OADF version. As I do this work, here is where the hard work is (will be) in all of this. Surface - Finding and documenting the surface area (endpoints + headers + parameters + security). There is just no way to automate this, you only know what you know. Response - Documenting the response, and schema using Charles Proxy. The first version of my API definitions rarely have the response modeled, as I depend on Charles Proxy plus a custom API I developed for generating JSON schema from HAR files.

			<p><em>28 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>As I conclude the first phase of profiling the APIs that I depend on, I am thinking about my API usage at scale, and some new questions are arising, that I wasn't thinking about before. I find my API consumption, and API integration thinking historically has been on an individual API basis, which something that I hope to evolve upon in 2016. Here are a handful of questions that have arose in my notebook, as I worked to profile these APIs: Where do I login / register for a service? What are the security definitions? Where do I get support? Where do I get updates? How do I manage my keys / tokens? What are the details of applications I have created? What are my rate limits? Plan levels available to me?&nbsp; Where am I at with my rate limits? Overall consumption? What am I spending across my API usage? Do I have plan B for any of these? Even possible? What SDKs do I depend on for integration? What are my code, content, and data licensing concerns? Am I adhering to branding requirements appropriately? Can I increase my API usage? Are there new fetaures I am not using? These are just a few of the questions that I wrote down, as I profiled the surface area of each of my APIs. I'm just creating OADF, API Blueprint, and Postman Collections, that allow me understand each endpoint, and the parameters across this almost 35 APIs I use. The next phase of my work involves profiling the security and data definitions for these APIs--a process which I'm sure will surface even more questions. I am not confident I will be able to answer all of these questions in the near future. Many API providers just do not make it easy for me, resulting in the addition of another manual process, which in a world of limited resources means it probably won't get done.

			<p>As I approach 2016, I'm stepping back, and looking at the big picture of what it is that do, and using what I learn to help guide what I will accomplish in 2016. I tend to not subscribe to the concept of predictions, and instead focus on what change I personally would like make within the API space, and this strategy is key to me achieving this vision. First, let's start with what do I do? I track on the world of APIs, with eye towards how we can better execute on the tech, business, and politics of APIs, based upon a better understanding of approaches established by existing API providers, and the features being offered by service providers who target the space. In 2010, I started tracking on API management, and in 2015 this has expanded to almost 35 areas: Aggregation Branding Client Containers Definitions Deployment Design Discovery DNS Embeddable Evangelism Hypermedia&nbsp; IDE Licensing Management Monetization Monitoring Partners Patents Performance Plans Privacy Ratings Real Time Reciprocity Regulation SDK Security Spreadsheets Terms of Service Virtualization Voice Webhooks Originally I saw these research projects as just various lines along the API life cycle or journey, but increasingly I'm also seeing these as just the "first" stack of API resources that I study. Meaning, in 2016 these aspects of the API journey are themselves increasingly API driven--API deployment, management, monitoring, and many other areas are being automated via APIs. Over the last five years, I've conducted my research by studying the approach of successful API providers like Amazon, SalesForce, Google, Twitter, and the longer tale of lesser known government, university, and utility APIs available today. Along the way, these APIs have started organizing themselves into logical groups for me, some based upon the industry they operate in, while others are more about specific business or developmental goals.&nbsp; I call these groupings "stacks"--they also go by other names like hubs, industries, categories, but one important aspect of stacks...[<a href="/2015/12/28/my-api-evangelist-strategy-for-2016/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>The existence, membership, and activity around local API Meetup groups is one of the overall health indicators in the API space. I've long been a proponent of local API meetups, helping jumpstart the early API Craft gatherings, as well as helping new Meetup groups get off the ground.
As we move into 2016, it is a good time to take another look at what API Meetup groups exist, and here is what I found:


San Francisco, CA with 884 members
San Francisco (API Craft) with 662 members
Washington, DC with 1306 members
Austin, TX with 717 members
Seattle, WA with 463 members
Chicago, IL with 394 members
New York, NY (API Craft) with 343 members
Los Angeles, CA with 191 members
Houston, TX with 141 members
Detroit, MI (API Craft)&nbsp;with 246 members
Boston (API Craft) with 426 members
Dallas, TX with 107 members
Denver, CO with 895 members
Nashville, TN with 185 members
Baltimore, MD with 76 members
Montreal, Quebec with 229 members&nbsp;
Toronto, Ontario with 201 members&nbsp;
Minnesota with 169 members&nbsp;
Raleigh, NC with 196 members

At @APIStrat, we use these numbers to help us decide where to put API conferences on, as on the ground support is crucial to making the event a success. I also consider the activity around these local Meetups a sign of how well the space is doing when it comes to outreach and evangelism across the entire industry.&nbsp;
If I missed an API Meetup in your community, please let me know. If you'd like to start an API Meetup in your community, also please reach out, as I may be able to help you jumpstart your efforts with speakers, sponsors, and attendeess. However, ultimately you will have to do all the hard work of finding venues, and getting the word out locally, which if you do right, can be a very rewarding journey in my opinion.

			<p><em>23 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>A handful of the most iconic APIs out there, which I also happen to depend on for my own operations, are some of the more frustratingly designed APIs I know. There are many API design offenses we all commit, but one of the most frustrating for me is when you use a single URL, and depend on a single parameter, for accessing everything an API has to offer. A couple of my favorite APIs, Flickr and Amazon EC2 both employ this approach. A single URL, and a single parameter for working with a wealth of API driven resources. This is a classic mistake of the technologist, delivering what you need, but making it difficult to actually learn about an API. This approach to API design delivers upon the functionality desired, but makes very difficult to document using common approaches available to us like OADF, and API Blueprint. When it comes to Amazon EC2, and Flickr, there is so much more value to be articulated in the API design by itself. Flickr organizes their API methods by grouping them on the main page for the API, and Amazon just groups each method for Amazon EC2 on their documentation page--something you can get in a single list if you like, if you prefer. It doesn't' take much work to expose the richness available within these APIs, but when documenting using OADF, it can be hard to articulate the value brought to the table by each resource. Amazon and Flickr both rely on all API calls utilizing GET, but rely on a query parameter to define each unique API call. When you document using OADF, this ends up being a single API endpoint, with a parameter, and any number of parameters to pull out the value an API offers. I needed to define each endpoint as /?method=XXXX, while still allowing each underlying parameter to be defined as a collection for each endpoint.&nbsp; The problem is that each parameter...[<a href="/2015/12/23/a-little-hack-to-help-me-better-define-method-based-apis-using-oadf/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>21 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>I'm down in the detail of how we craft our API plans, looking at the approaches of almost 100 different providers, and working to establish a common schema for cataloging the plans of these popular APIs. I have already talked about dialing in your API pricing down to the endpoint and level, but was something I wanted to take a little bit further. In my previous story, I talked about how mature API providers charge different rates for POST, and PUT requests, than they did for GET requests. Using this scenario, what if we wanted to incentivize and reward behavior through variable rate pricing at the HTTP verb level, to give developers more ownership over an API, including better access and pricing structures the more they contribute. Lets use a standard business directory like say Crunchbase as a model. Everyone wants this data, and you only get so many GET requests, based upon the rate limits limits they've set. What if I was given access to more GET requests, based upon the number of POST and PUT requests I made? Meaning the more data I had added, and updated, the more access I was given when pulling data. Something I think could incentivize developers to be more involved, and improve on the overall quality of content or data via an API. Of course, there would be ways people could game this, but I'm pretty sure you could identify the bad actors using modern API management approaches. You would also need other checks and balances, and quality control elements to make this a reality, but I wanted to focus on the service composition aspect. Could you incentivize internal, partner, or even public API developers to take more ownership of a resource, and help make it better, by applying variable rate controls at the GET level, that are influenced by controls at the POST, and PUT levels? Something to think about. It is also something I will...[<a href="/2015/12/21/variable-rates-on-your-api-get-requests-depending-on-how-many-post-or-put-requests-you-make/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>There are more HTTP client tools out there than I can shake a stick at (I've reached that point, I'm shaking sticks at things), and in 2016 I predict there will be even more entrants into the space. I'd say Postman was a pioneering force in the evolution of the HTTP client when it comes for web API space, but is something that it is beginning to collide with API design tooling from Apiary, as well as being morphed by new players like Stoplight.io. Maybe I am playing with more of these environments than the average API consumer is, because of what I do for a living, but I have to say, I am getting tired of "importing" my API definitions. Don't me wrong. I am stoked that all tools support the importing of machine readable API definitions like OADF, and API Blueprint, but I cannot help&nbsp;always looking to what should be next, and I want to be able to just run each API, in my HTTP client of my choice. For all of my own APIs, I provide a Postman icon, and link to a Postman Collection. It just gives you quick access to the machine readable currency that all services I depend on speak, OADF, API Blueprint, and Postman Collection. However, I still have to import it into Postman, or other HTTP API client, or service I will be using. While this is a good start, and is something I recommend other API providers do, I think we can still do better. If you are operating one of the HTTP API clients, or planning one of the next generation&nbsp;API cleints, tools, garage, hub, playground, studio, workbench, or builder, can you please provide a "run in XXXX" embeddable button please?

			<p>I am continuing to build on the subway map exploration work, that I talked about at @Defrag and @APIStrat last month, and have a more static version of my API life cycle explorer ready, which I'm simply calling the API journey. I have only rolled this out for my API plans research, but so far I'm happy with the results, something that shouldn't be too difficult to light up for the other 30+ areas I'm researching. There is quite of bit of research that goes into the work that I publish, and the subway analogy is allowing me to share more it, making more parts of it more accessible, in ways I was never able to before. Currently you can take the journey through each of the stops along the API plans portion of my research, and learn about in details about some of the common patterns I'm seeing across the space. For each stop I provide a title, and description for the stop, but if I have related organizations, tools, links, and even specific APIs or questions to ask at this stop in the life cycle for any API. My goal is to take the building blocks from leading API platforms, and the features offered by companies offering services to the space, and make accessible to anyone who wants to learn for their own operations. The narrative for my API plans journey isn't 100% there, and some of the stops are lacking in description, as well as related organizations, tools, and other links. However it gives me an excellent framework to further flush out my research, while also sharing it with my readers, in a potentially interactive way. Eventually I'd like for you to be able to actually select the pieces that are important to you, and save it as a customized list at the end--soon!

I'm still working through prototypes for my life cycle explorer, but the current version has organizations, tools, links, and questions, along with the title and description of each stop of the life cycle journey I am trying to bring into focus. Part of my approach in identifying the different lines, areas, and stops along this life cycle involves taking a look at the approach of leading API providers, as well as service being offered by companies selling their solutions to these API providers--giving me two sides of the API life cycle coin. In the last couple months I have also found another way to identify potential building blocks, and round off the ones I have, through the API definitions of leading API providers. All I do, is craft an OADF file for each of the API service providers I track on, within each area of my research. I'm spending time tonight working on my API monitoring research, so I look at three of the service providers I track on, who have APIs. The OADF specs are not complete, but provide me a baseline definition for the surface area of each API, something I'll round out with more use.

			<p><em>15 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>How to monetize APIs is on of the top questions I get from companies, right after concerns around security and control. I have separated my research into two main buckets, the first is focused on the questions I should be asking around API monetization as I'm planning my strategy, with the second focused on the actual plans for the operations of leading API providers. There is a lot of overlap between the two, but I guess API monetization is more strategy, and API plans is more about operations. When I started my API monetization research, it was very focused on how do you make money from your APIs, resulting in the poorly crafted title. I'm not making the same mistake with my API plans research, which is meant to help define a wide range of motivations for providing APIs. I think every API should have an API monetization plan, to cover the costs of acquisition, deployment, and management in a sensible way, and all APIs should have a plan--not all APIs need to have pricing. This is why I labeled my research into API plans the way I did, instead of just focusing on API pricing. Not all APIs have a straightforward API monetization strategy that can be translated into "pricing", from the dark side of platforms that are just content farms, to the brighter side where platforms are focused on the social good. There are many motivations behind API operations, this is why I'm trying to come up with some common ways to reference these motivations in a machine readable way. Keep an eye on my API plan research, as I'm rapidly evolving the building blocks that go into planning your API operations. I am also publishing some common, machine readable definitions from leading API players like AWS, Twilio, and more. All of this is very alpha work, so it might seem cluttered at first, but I am working to slice it up into...[<a href="/2015/12/15/why-i-labeled-my-research-api-plans-instead-of-api-pricing/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>During my API discovery session talk at @APIStrat Austin this last November, I talked about what I see as an added dimension to the concept of API discovery, one that will become increasingly important when it comes to actually moving things forward --- discovering solutions that are API driven vs. API discovery, where a developer is looking for an API.&nbsp; It might not seem that significant to developers, but SaaS services like Zapier, DataFire, and API hubs like Cloud Elements, bring this critical new dimension to how people actually will find your APIs. As nice as ProgrammableWeb has been for the last 10 years, we have to get more sophisticated about how we get our APIs in front of would-be consumers. We just can't depend on everyone who will put our API to work, immediately thinking that they need an API--most likely they are just going to need a solution to their problem, and secondarily need to understand there is an API driving things behind the scenes. Of of many examples of this in the wild, could be in the area of tech support for your operations. Maybe you use Jira currently, because this is what your development team uses, but with a latest release you need something a little more public facing. When you are exploring what is possible with API reciprocity services like Zapier, and API hubs like Cloud Elements, you get introduced to other API driven solutions like Zendesk, or Desk.com from SalesForce. This is just one example of how APIs can make an impact on the average business user, and will be the way API discovery happens in the future. In this scenario, I didn't set out looking for an API, but because I use API enabled service providers, I am introduced to other alternative solutions that might also help me tackle the problem I need. I may never have even known SalesForce had a help desk solution, if I wasn't...[<a href="/2015/12/15/solution-discovery-instead-of-api-discovery-via-api-aggregation-and-reciprocity-providers/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>As part of evaluating 50+ companies, and their business approach to delivering APIs, I came across the Box platform. As I am looking through this diverse slice of API companies, I am looking to better understand the motivations behind providing APIs, and how sophisticated the monetization or overall planning are for their operations.&nbsp; For most APIs, there is either no evident monetization strategy, the strategy is directly coupled with API access, or indirectly part of larger monetization strategy around existing devices, products, advertising, software as a service, or any other type of service. When it came to Box, they have a clear SaaS pricing model, as well as one specifically for their API ecosystem--of course they are both intertwined, but the fact there are separate dimensions I felt made it worth highlighting. Box has obviously put a lot of thought into their business model. In addition to having a separate set of plans for their SaaS, and developer areas, they have the developer page broken down into packages by Box platform, content, and view--which I don't fully grasp yet, and will continue to evaluate. Out of the 50+ companies I looked at, Box was the only to have such a significant separation between the SaaS and developer layers, whie also being very tightly coupled, leading to me putting aside for further consideration. This latest sprint in my API plan research was limited. I am guessing that the more companies I find that operate like Box, the more this will all come into focus. I'm guessing at Box central there is a command and control center with a master plan on the wall of how the SaaS side of things works with the API side, as well as a breakdown of the tiers that is based upon their operational experience over the years. The best I can do from the outside is try document the patterns across SaaS and API pioneers like Box, and understand the...[<a href="/2015/12/15/how-tight-is-the-coupling-between-the-saas-business-model-and-the-api/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>I'm looking at the pricing APIs offered by some of the API providers that are further along in their API journey. This is just one example of how API providers are offering more operational level APIs to their developers, giving them control over their own integration, allowing programmatic control over account settings, billing, rate limits, and pricing. I've talked about the need to allow for more automation of the modern API life cycle, allowing API consumers to better manage their consumption across the many APIs they are depending on. This is why I'm spending a greater amount of time focusing on API service providers in the space practicing what they preach, and making simple, easy to use APIs available for the services they offer. When API service providers do this, it make it easier for API providers to extend API driven operations to their consumers. The fact that my 3Scale API management infrastructure has an API, allows me to proxy and deliver a pricing, plans, and rate limit API to my API consumers. All of these elements are present in the service composition 3Scale provides me, and the fact that they have an API allows me to extend it as part of my own API stack to my consumers. This does not stop with just the API management line of my API life cycle. I can provide programmatic access to my API monitoring, because API Science and Runscope has APIs, and to my SDKs via APIMATIC, and multi-format versions of my API definitions using the API Transformer API. Every stop along my API life cycle involves my API consumers, and in addition to me being able to automate my API operations using APIs, my developers should be able to automate their API consumption as well. The moral of this story I guess, is that if you are providing services to API providers--have all of your services available via an API.

			<p><em>15 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I am spending a significant amount of time looking through the pricing pages for leading API providers, working to get a sense for some of the common approaches to API monetization in use across the space. Along the way I am also finding some simple and unique approaches from API providers that I wanted to share as bit-size API planning stories here on the blog.
As the API service composition of leading providers evolve in the space you see platforms getting more granular in not just how they control access to their API resources, but also how they incentivize consumption. When I say granular, I am talking about API pricing for APIs available down to the endpoint, or even HTTP verb level. Here is a description, straight from Amazon S3:
PUT, COPY, POST, or LIST Requests = $0.005 per 1,000 requests ,GET and all other Requests = $0.004 per 10,000 requests, with delete requests being free
This approach represents a sophisticated view of API planning and monetization. Companies who are earlier on in their API journey often only use their GET verb, afraid of the repercussions of opening up PUT, POST, or DELETE. This is where API service composition comes into play, and gives you greater control over your resources, while also opening up access, and incentivizing the type of behavior that is beneficial to both API provider and consumer.
I've come across a number of providers who are taking this approach, and will link to them more within my API plan research. I have a whole list of bit-size API monetization, pricing, and planning stories queued up. I will try to space them out, alongside other stories, but you will just have to suffer a little as I spend time expanding on my&nbsp;API monetization, and&nbsp;API plans&nbsp;research areas.&nbsp;

Along the way I am also finding some simple and unique approaches from API providers that I wanted to share as bit-size API planning stories here on the blog.
As I was working to understand the coupling between the Box SaaS business model, and the one applied to their API, I noticed an interesting element, that was part of their enterprise API plan--custom terms of service. At first glance it doesn't seem like much, but making elements of your TOS dynamic, allowing them up to be used as a metric within your API plans, opens up a whole world of possibilities.&nbsp;
I have to note, this option is only available in the enterprise plan, which means only those with the most resources get this opportunity, but I still think its presence is meaningful. Right now, most terms of service and privacy policies are immovable shadows that guide how we do business and conduct our personal lives online, so the ability to think of them more dynamically, and one that could be tied to specific API access plans has huge potential. Unfortunately in the true Silicon Valley spirit, only some of this potential will be good, much of it will be in the name of exploitation, and the shifting of how power flows.
I have terms of service listed as a potential metric in my API plans research--we'll see where this goes, as my work evolves. I have a whole list of bit-size API monetization, pricing, and planning stories queued up. I will try to space them out, alongside other stories, but you will just have to suffer a little as I spend time expanding on my&nbsp;API monetization, and&nbsp;API plans&nbsp;research areas.&nbsp;

			<p><em>14 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I am seeing more operations focused API tooling emerge lately, like Stoplight.io, and as I'm adding API reciprocity platform DataFire to my list of integration, automation, and interoperability providers, I'm asking myself -- where is the API reciprocity platform designed specifically for managing API operations?
I am talking about the Zapier, but just for API providers and consumers. With Datafire, I see things have a little more business and operations edge, than I've seen from more consumer offerings like Zapier. What I am hoping for, is someone to build a platform that lets you automate, integrate, and orchestrate all of your API focused operational needs across the cloud.
This new platform will automatically setup monitoring using API Science or Runscope, when a new containerized microservice fires up. I could have recipes for automatically registering public APIs.json indexes, with APIs.io, the open source API search engine. Whenever a new developer registers via my 3Scale API infrastructure, I could profile them on FullContact, and queue up their Twitter, LinkedIn, and Github profiles for me to engage with as part of my evangelism efforts.
I could go on and on, regarding tasks that I need automated across my API operations, and about how the services that I employ are providing me with APIs to manage things. All of this is making the potential for integration, interoperability, automation, transformation, and most importantly reciprocity within my API operations increase pretty dramatically. Hopefully someone will follow the lead of Zapier, and newer offerings like DataFire, and bring a solution to the table that will help alleviate some of the challenges we face daily, in the operations of our APIs.

Along the way I am finding some simple approaches from API providers that I wanted to share as bit-size API planning stories here on the blog. After recently landing on the pricing page for identity service provider Auth0, I saw that they included a simple message and link to the latest blog post about API pricing changes. It is a simple, subtle, yet very prominent approach to making sure your API consumers are aware of pricing changes that may impact their integration. I recently wrote about providing a messaging area to reach developers upon platform login, but this approach from Auth0 is about providing relevant messaging no matter where you are at in the developer portal--not just at login. Couple of lessons for me, extracted from this approach: Prominent FMA - Providing a prominently placed, flexible messaging area, can help make sure your API consumers stay up to speed on the latest, when it comes to platform operations.&nbsp; Pricing Storytelling - Telling the story around each change in pricing is a critical aspect of operation. Publishing a story on your blog, syndicating out through your social channels, and prominent placement via a FMA is key. This help rekenforce the fact that we should make sure to regularly communicating out our decisions around API monetization. Also making sure there is a saturation factor to our messaging, and that it is available via our blogs, Twitter, LinkedIn, and any other relevant page or channel used to reach API consumers.

			<p><em>12 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>A lot can be learned from the pioneers of the API space. Companies like Amazon and Twilio have been used as a model by many providers, and are something I reference often across my research and storytelling. These providers have been playing the API game for a while, so they have a wealth of experience to bring to the table, but they also are working with well defined, and highly valuable API driven resources which we can learn from. I'm neck deep in evaluating the pricing of modern APIs, and Amazon and Twilio both provide a wealth of things to consider when it comes to API monetization. One of the common patterns that has emerged for me, is the presence of pricing APIs: AWS Price List API - In order to meet the needs of these customers and to foster the development of even more tools that focus on cost management, budgeting, and the like, we are launching the AWS Price List API. Twilio Pricing API - The Pricing REST resource provides a simple API to pull real time, account-specific pricing for Twilio's messaging, voice and phone number products. As Amazon says on their page, "Many AWS customers and partners have been asking for a programmatic way to access prices for AWS services. Current customers and partners would like to make sure that their budgeting, forecasting, and analytics tools are able to analyze AWS prices without having to resort to scraping our web site." These types of API resources provide the rest of us with a glimpse at what the future possibly holds for our own APIs. The world of cloud computing, voice, and messaging APIs are significantly more mature than other areas being served by APIs, but how the leading API providers are monetizing their APIs, and develop tooling for their consumers, gives us elements we should all be considering for our own road maps.

			<p>A blog RSS feed is still my number one way to monitor what is happening across the API space. I also use RSS from Google Alerts and TalkWalker to monitor a variety of leading API industry keywords. RSS is an important information gathering format, and I wanted to help some of my non-developer followers, understand how they can aggregate RSS feeds across a variety of topics, clean up, and publish a centralized API for all feeds. To take advantage of this advice, you will need to have three separate accounts: Zapier - API reciprocity provider, helping you move your bits and bytes around online. Google - Online spreadsheet solution, which can be used to deploy APIs. Restlet - API deployment and management as a service provider. Once you have accounts with these three services, you can take advantage of the features each brings to the table: Pull RSS From Providers - Using Zapier, you can setup Zaps, which will allow you to connect RSS feeds, and route them to your Google Sheets. Setup a recipe for each RSS feed you will want to pull, store, and make available later. Google Sheet Content Store - Google Sheets provides you a data store, which your Zapier recipe will route all new RSS posts to. Depending on how many feeds you pull, and aggregate, you can setup one or many documents, and worksheets. Publish Central API - Using Restlet, you can setup what is called an entity store, which pulls the content of your spreadsheet(s), and stores them locally for publishing as an API. Once deployed, you can then setup a web API, which provides all content pulled via RSS, as a single API. Ok, many developers are going to ask me, "why the hell would you do this"? First, this isn't for you--it is for folks without programming experience.

			<p><em>07 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>There are some pretty good examples (in my opinion), of well defined API service providers across the API landscape right now-- companies, who are selling services specifically to API providers. You know how you can tell a good provider? They do one thing, or just a handful of things well, it is well presented, and they also have an API -- who woulda thought that? Companies selling services to API providers should also do so via an API! I am most definitely biased in showcase these companies, but a couple examples of this in action can be found with APIMATIC, Runscope, 3Scale, SecureDB, and API Scrience. These are all companies that I support, but I support them because they offer valuable services to companies who are operating APIs, and they do it in a simple, well thought out way, complete with an API. When you are crafting the strategy for the API service provider you would like to launch, here are my recommendations of what you should be including: Website - Simple, modern, and informative website for your customers to discover, and on-board with the services you offer. Twitter - Have a genuine, active Twitter account that actually engages in conversations with community. Github - Establish an active, and meaningful Github presence via user account or organization, and make it your open work bench. Blog - Provide a thoughtful, active, and informative blog to comunicate with the community, your customers, and the public. API - If you are selling APIs to API providers, you need to make sure and be drinking the kool-aid with an API of your own. SaaS - Follow the principles of software as a service. I do not want to deal with old ways of purchasing and licensing software. Pricing - Offer tiered pricing, so that we can kick the tires, and small companies (or groups) like myself can actually afford what you are offering. Support - Make sure you are...[<a href="/2015/12/07/minimum-viable-api-service-provider-blueprint/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I spent the weekend adding a Siren media type to my API building blocks API, in support of my API life cycle map&nbsp;work. Every time I dive into using Siren, and begin applying hypermedia constraints to my API design, I'm pleasantly surprised by what I learn. I am not a hypermedia evangelist, I am just trying to share what I learn, as I go evolve, and hopefully add to some of the existing knowledge that is floating around out there.&nbsp; This work on my building blocks API is still very much a work in progress, when it comes to my own understanding of hypermedia, but also how I can use it to craft a more meaningful story around API(s). The first major benefit I realized, was instead of just have a basic JSON representation of my API building blocks, I was immediately forced to consider some very important dimensions around the JSON data I was serving up. Properties - What are the properties of the collection returned, or individual data sets. Entities - What are the actual structured objects that I am returning, and how do they relate. Actions - What actions can be taken around my data, and how can a developer engage with it. Links - What relevant links about the entities, and the information it contains are present. Before this, I would just have a JSON array or object, which is essentially what I have under properties now, but now that I'm using Siren, I also have other meaningful relationships between my data present as entities. I also can provide relevant actions and links that any developer will potentially need, when they are working with the data provided. For me, this evolution is significant. It isn't just about alleviating my version control challenges, or providing &nbsp;the perfect client (well I do have some client ambitions in doing this), it is just about helping think more deeply about the relationships between all of...[<a href="/2015/12/07/going-beyond-just-json-data-and-considering-the-relationships-that-exist-and-the-actions-that-can-be-taken/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>07 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>If you were at @defrag or @apistrat in November, you know that I am working to better understand the often complex world of APIs using the Subway map concept. My goal is to better understand the overall API life cycle, as well as the life cycle of individual APIs, and how I can articulate, strategize, and execute on it all, using a subway experience.&nbsp;
It made me happy to see the folks over at Restlet playing with the same concept&nbsp;(we didn't coordinate on it honestly), to help articulate HTTP status codes, which is a very important topic for the space, and we need more education tools, and stories around it. Using the subway map analogy, Restlet provides a representation of the five areas of status codes, providing a simple way to explore them, and find a description of each individual status code.

The subway map they provide is currently a static map, but this is one of the biggest potential areas in using this analogy for me, is that with the right JavaScript + JSON voodoo, you can make it real-time, and interactive. This is something I'm working on to bring the entire lifecycle to the forefront this month.&nbsp;
Nice work Restlet team, I enjoy these efforts by providers to help educate the space, especially when they do it in creative and fun ways like this.
Disclosure: Restlet is an API Evangelist partner.

			<p><em>07 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>I started API Evangelist, because I saw a huge deficiency in the overall API conversation--nobody was talking about the business of all of this, and how you actually make money doing this emerging web API thing. Over time, I also discovered that very few people were also studying, and discussing the politics of APIs. Sure, when something flares up around terms of service violations, or there is an acquisition that the community dislikes, we discuss it, but we have to talk about the political issues in real-time, not at polarize-time. From my vantage point, the business and politics of API operations, internal as well as external influences, continue to be the number one things that negatively impact API operations, over anything technical. Let's just look at a couple examples of this in action: Money - How are you going to operate an API without any money? Either from paying customers, or internally from other sources. Doers - If your business has been built on traditional sales and support models, evolving consumers to a doers mentality will not be an easy. Competing Interests - Various groups within an organization competing for budget, attention, and any other way regular current operations impact your API vision. Management Change - Your CTO had your back, and the new one not so much. It could be about lower level or mid-management support, all the way to the top. When the champions leave, API programs often dry up on the vine. Industry Regulation - Silicon loves to be in denial of the larger world, and the regulatory frameworks that are in place across many industries--once you grow big enough, or operate in the right space, this will become clearer. Scope - How big are things? Software? Teams? Systems? Processes? There are many things that are big in the enterprise and even small businesses, that will resist decoupling and unbundling. People just do not think of things in small, bite-size chunks--it just...[<a href="/2015/12/07/75-of-your-api-efforts-in-the-enterprise-will-be-cultural-and-political-not-technical/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>I am spending some time taking another look at my "client research", which started out as just about Postman and PAW, but now contains ten separate services I'm and bundling into this area of research. As with all my research areas, these project repos shift, evolve, split and marge with time, as the API space changes, and my awareness of it grows.&nbsp; I &nbsp;completely understand the term "client" doesn't provide an adequate label for this bucket of research, but for now, it will have to do. As I add a couple of new services to the bucket, and made my way through some of the existing ones I had, I wanted to step back and look at what they were offering, but more importantly the message that went around quantify what tehse companies were offering. When it comes to what I call "lines along the API lifecycle", I saw these areas represented. This is where the API client line potentially intersects with all of these other API life-cycle lines. However, When you start to analyze the features or building blocks offered by these service providers, you begin to see each stop along along the API client line, which becomes pretty critical to other areas of the API lifecycle. I know that what I am saying might not be completely clear, it isn't for me either. That is why I tell stories, to try and find the patterns, and learn how to articulate all the moving parts. I'm still trying to figure out what to call my research, alongside all of these API service providers working to define just exactly what it is they are selling as well.&nbsp; The more time I spend with my API client research, the more all of this comes into focus.

			<p><em>03 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>This is another one of those topics I talk a lot about, but only found few examples of me talking about on the blog--API service composition. If you aren't familiar with the concept, it is the art of taking digital resources (aka APIs), and mix and match them in different ways, until you find the right approach to delivering APIs, that provides value for both provider and consumer. API service composition is about taking the basic building blocks of any web API, the URL, path, and VERBS (ability to get, add, update, and delete), and put them into as many different configurations as you think makes sense. Limiting who can access, how much they use, restrict by time frame, and crafting different pricing for different users or groups, require trial periods, setup costs, and even restricting to specific countries. API service composition is all about taking your APIs, and if you are using modern API infrastructure like from 3Scale, you can compose any service you desire, serving it up to anyone, in a secure way, using the open Internet. This is the magic of modern API-driven solutions, when an API can be any digital resource, from simple data and content, to media like images, audio, and video, all the way to an increasing number of devices like fitness trackers, thermostats in our homes, and even our cars. When you have all of these resources at your finger tips, and the ability to compose them into any possible package, to satisfy any group of consumers--you have unlimited potential. This is why so many companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are jumping on the API train. When you do APIs right, you gain a new level of control over the increasing amount of digital resources that are dominating our lives. API service composition is the key to all of this, and is one of the parts of the journey I enjoy the most--composing meaningful API service that...[<a href="/2015/12/03/what-is-api-service-composition/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>03 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>I'm working my way through some of the low hanging fruit in my API notebook, when it comes to stories, and found a story thread I was working on regarding automating API key management. I'm personally storing my keys, across the private master branch for my API reps, because I don't have any super-sensitive data, and it helps me manage across hundreds of APIs, in a central way.&nbsp; I've talked about the need to automate API key management in the past--with the number of APIs we are using, to reach the level of security we will need, the lower level of keys will need a global refresh and management process. This level of keys most likely won't ever result in large scale security breaches, but will cause plenty headaches for both API providers and consumers. If you use one of the following API management solutions, they provide you with an API for managing your API keys: 3Scale Apigee Tyk This will help you manage your keys, if you are an API provider, but doesn't do a lot for you to manage your API keys across providers, as an API consumer. Amazon provides a key management solution, but at first glance it appears to be something you can use to manage keys across your AWS infrastructure (am I wrong?)--which makes sense for supporting AWS objectives. ;-) When I wrote my last post on the growing need for API key management solutions, I received a number of email and DMs, which yielded two pretty interesting open source key management solutions, Vault and Keywhiz. I'm going to evaluate these solutions for their viability as a back-end for an API driven, API key management solution, but I have a lot more work to do.&nbsp; I'm also working with a partner of mine, SecureDB, and consider the possibility fo developing an encrypted API key management solution, which then would be accessible via their secure API.

			<p><em>02 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I've done this a couple of times now. I took&nbsp;PhantomJS, and created my Screenshot API, and used&nbsp;ImageMagick to create my Image Manipulation API. These are two openly licensed software solutions, which I took, and am using as an API.&nbsp;
What are my licensing considerations? If I keep my server side code licensed according to the specifications, am I fine? PhantomJS is licensed under BSD, and ImageMagick is Apache 2.0. Does the licensing extend itself to the commercial services I would potentially offer via an API interface? There are lots of questions to satisfy, before I move forward--I guess I am looking for a precedent.
I am evaluating at a number of openly licensed software solutions right now to deliver a variety of stops along the API life-cycle, ranging from design, to deployment, virtualization, and much more. As always, I am trying to better understand the layers involved, and how software licenses, patent, and potentially copyright might apply.
Just putting it out there to the universe, and curious to see what comes back.

I stumbled across&nbsp;Objective Revision Evaluation Service (ORES)&nbsp;last night,&nbsp;a web service running in Wikimedia Labs that provides machine learning as a service across Wikimedia Projects, and is designed to help automate vandalism detection and removal for content, being developed as part of the&nbsp;R:Revision scoring as a service&nbsp;project.
As I came across, I was also considering different access plans across my APIs, with some of the plans allowing for updating existing content in the system--the topic of abuse of API access was on my mind. I'm curious if ORES could be applied to any sort of content or data post via a PUT / PATCH API request?
Even if it didn't 100% out of the repo, maybe it could it be evolved to help manage the PUT / PATCH layer of API operations, allowing platforms to open up a little bit more, and open up more of their HTTP verbs, to a wider audience. Something like this could go a long way to helping API providers secure, and stabilize their API operations, and loosen service composition restrictions a little further.
Just a thought, as I'm kicking the tires of some of the open source API offerings I come across. Seems like to me, there is an opportunity for someone to deploy these open solutions as a service, and help API providers open up a little more. Just sharing with my audience, as a possible service that would benefit the API space, and hopefully make someone a little beer money--who knows!

			<p><em>02 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>I have been learning about hypermedia over the last three years now, and only earlier this year, I began playing with Siren to help me craft a better experience around my API industry news and link curation API. My motivations in going down this hypermedia road was never about easing my client side pain, or helping me with future versions of my API--I am just not that sophisticated of an operation. I started playing with hypermedia to help evolve the experience around the API news I was curating each week, making it so you could browse week by week, month by month, but also by topic, company, author, etc. I'm still trying to figure it out all out, and honestly the project is currently in the ditch after hitting the wall this fall, and not really giving a shit about the flow of API news. (I am better now, thx!) Now in December, I'm trying to take my building block API, which provides access to over 600 of the common patterns I've tracked on across the API space. These are the features offered by API service providers, and the competitive advantage brought to the table by the successful API providers I keep an eye on, and they are all potential stops along the API life-cycle I am working to define. My API building block API is a pretty standard content API, providing each element broken down by category, and type, with other supporting details. However, now I need to be able to plot them on a subway map, with an endless number of configurations, and dimensions to the journey. Via my building block API, I need to return any single stop along the API life-cycle, but along with it I need to provide the next stop in the line, the previous stop (paging 101), but then if I hit a transfer station, or other element, I need to offer an unlimited number of dimensions.

			<p><em>02 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>
Most of the tooling and services I come across in the API space, are designed for developers. As I play with more services, and put tools to work, trying understand their role in the API space, some take a lot of work to figure out, while others are pretty clear--it will be these tools and services that the masses of business users adopt, as part of the API evolution that is occurring online currently.
There are just a handful of services out there right now, that I think are mainstream ready, and are something that the average business user of the web, should be playing with right now--here are three of them:

Restlet - Deploy API from a Google Spreadsheet.
Blockspring - Use APIs in a Google Spreadsheet.
Form.io - Deploy an API as form, via Single Page App.

There are other services and tools out there that will help you deploy and consume APIs, but these stand out, because they help the average business user solve real world business problems they are facing, without needing to write code. They also anchor there solutions in existing tooling that are ubiquitous, and part of every day business operations--the spreadsheet and the form.
Developers might care about the technical details of APIs, and evangelists like me might be able to convince some of the average business users of the potential of APIs, but before we can bring the masses on-board, we will need the right tools. Restlet, Blockspring, and Form.io have the potential to be these tools, and help the "normals" become active participants in the API economy, but more importantly find the (API driven) solutions they need for the problems they face every day.

			<p>This conversation has come up over 10 times this month, at Defrag, APIStrat, and online conversations via Skype and GHangouts. The concept of API virtualization solutions. I am not talking about virtualization in the cloud computing and Docker sense, although that will play a fundamental role in the solutions I am trying to articulate. What I am focusing on is about providing sandbox, QA environments, and other specialized virtualization solutions for API providers, that make API consumers worlds much easier.&nbsp; I've touched on examples of this in the wild, with my earlier post on&nbsp;API sandbox and simulator from Carvoyant, which is an example of the need for virtualization solutions that are tailored for the connected automobile solution. Think of this, but for every aspect of the fast growing Internet of Things space. The IoT demand is about the future opportunity, I've talked about the current need, when I published, I Wish All APIs Had Sandbox Environment By Default. I see envision 1/3 of these solutions being about deploying Docker containers on demand, 1/3 being about virtualizing the API using common API definitions, and the final 1/3 being about the data provided with the solutions. This is where I think the right team(s) could develop some pretty unique skills when it comes to delivering specialized simulations tailored for testing home, automobile, agriculture, industrial, transportation, and other unique API solutions. We are going to need "virtualized" versions of our APIs, whether or not it is for web, mobile, devices, or just for managing APIs throughout their life cycle. You can see a handful of the current API virtualizations out there on my research in this area, but I predict the demand for more robust, and specialized API virtualization solutions is going to dramatically increase as the space continues its rapid expansion. I just wanted to put it out there, and encourage all y'all to think more about this area, and push forward the concept of API virtualization...[<a href="/2015/12/01/the-growing-need-for-api-virtualization-solutions/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>01 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>I get regular links sent to me, and foiks telling me that freemium API access is a bad idea. That it doesn't help your API sales funnel, and was something that was just a thing, for a brief moment in time. The folks who always bring me these stories, are not API consumers, they are business folks.&nbsp; I agree, there are some really bad examples of freemium in play across the API space, and with the bad behavior we see from API consumers, I fully understand why stories make their rounds--leaving a bad taste in the mouths of API providers for freemium access. The disconnect that allows this to happen in my opinion, is folks not thinking through their monetization, plans, and pricing in an API centric way. Folks approach it as a across the board monetization approach, and do not think of it as a tool to apply on a resource by resource basis.&nbsp; Freemium is just one tool in your toolbox, and should evaluated at every step in the monetization planning for your APIs, and used, or not used, based upon your well planned on-boarding funnel for your API consumers. Consider educational access to your API resources (also one tool in your toolbox), which is a common offering from API providers. You wouldn't offer this in all scenarios, it just doesn't make sense, but you aso wouldn't just dismiss it as a bad idea--you keep in your toolbox for when it makes sense. I see API operations let by business folks dismiss freemium as a bad idea because they don't experience on how it influences in the on-boarding process, but I also see API operations let by developers dismiss the need for traditional sales approaches, and hurt themselves in similiar ways. Ultimately, I recommend iterating through the list of common API monetization building blocks I've aggregated from leading API providers, for each resource you are planning to release.

			<p><em>01 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>My API Stack began as a news site, and evolved into a directory of the APIs that I monitor in the space. I published APIs.json indexes for the almost 1000 companies I am trackig on, with almost 400 OADF files for some of the APIs I've profiled in more detail. My mission around the project so far, has been to create an open source, machine readable repo for the API space. I have &nbsp;had two recent occurrences that are pushing me to expand on my API Stack work. First, I have other entities who want to contribute monitoring data and other elements I would like to see collected, but haven't had time. The other is I that I have started spidering the URLs of the API portals I track on, and need a central place to store the indexes, so that others can access. Ultimately I'd like to see the API Stack act as a public repo, where anyone can grab the data they need to discovery, evaluate, integrate, and stay in tune with what APIs are doing, or not doing. In addition to finding OADF, API Blueprint, and RAML files by crawling and indexing API portals, and publishing in a public repo, I want to build out the other building blocks that I index with APIs.json, like pricing, and TOS changes, and potentially monitoring, testing, performance data available. Next I will publish some pricing, monitoring, and portal site crawl indexes to the repo, for some of the top APIs out there, and start playing with the best way to store the JSON, and other files, and provide an easy way explore and play with the data. If you have any data that you are collecting, and would like to contribute, or have a specific need you'd like to see tracked on, let me know, and I'll add to the road map.

			<p><em>01 Dec 2015</em></p>
			<p>I am continuing my series on helping non-developers realize they can publish, and put APIs to work, without having an API expert in their pocket, using Zapier, Google Sheets, and Restlet. Its no secret that Restlet is an API Evangelist partner, and they are my partner because they are the easiest way to deploy a web API--something I am trying to help the "normals" understand the untapped potential of. As I finish up my @APIStrat conference again, for the sixth time, I'm reminded that I need to harvest the essential Twitter exhaust from the conference, otherwise if I wait too long, I won't be able to get it. You see, Twitter limits what you can grab from the Twitter API by either time, or number of Tweets, so I can only gather X amount of Tweets, and if I wait too long, I'm often out of luck. It is critical that I do this right away, and depending on how loud the Twitter exhaust is, I need to do it while the event is still going on. To start, you obviously need a Twitter account, but you will also need a Zapier, Google and Restlet account. Then using Zapier you can gather the following Twitter data points, and send to a Google Sheets: New Mentions New Followers New Favorites New Tweets How you store these in Google Sheets is up to you, but I recommend breaking each data point down as its own sheet, and even by separate time-frame like day, week, or month. It helps to keep things broken up into smaller chunks, when you are using Google Sheets as a data store--tricks of the trade! Zapier gives you everything you need to setup the Zaps that route mentions, followers, favorites, and your tweets to the Google Sheet(s), and once they are there, you can clean up, edit, and organize as you see fit. Next Restlet comes into the picture, allowing you deploy an...[<a href="/2015/12/01/deploying-an-api-from-your-critical-twitter-data-without-being-a-programmer/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I've seen something at an ever increasing pace lately, situations where very intelligent software engineers hit a wall, and realize they do not understand the fundamental building blocks of HTTP, and the web that we are all using daily. It makes my heart ache, because I remember when I found myself in the same place, and still suffer from the deprivation I experienced.
Whether it was my time programming in Microsoft-land, Drupal, WordPress, or any other Web 2.0-land, I eventually realized how much was hidden from me behind the curtain. When you bundled this with the fact I'm a fairly privileged white male software engineer who can be fairly clueless about what is around me, I missed a lot. Something I still find myself recovering from in 2015, even after five years of exclusively studying web APIs--you know, the ones that use HTTP for transport?&nbsp;
I'm not stupid, but with my lazerfocus &trade;, I often miss a lot. I feel that many of the smart people I know suffer from a similar illness, but do not have the fortitude for transparency, or the humbleness to accept, that will allow them to move on. Programming language dogma, and platform or framework dependencies can be a powerful thing, but they can also do a lot protect us from what we need to learn to actually be successful, and grow.
At this point, i question everything. What I know. What a platform might be hiding from me, to sell back to me as feature, and what is the bigger picture of the Internet that I use everyday, and often take for granted.

Runscope added the ability to import and export your API tests as JSON, helping make API monitoring a much more flexible and portable thing. You can import and export using the Runscope UI, as well as import via their API, help you automate the setup of your API tests.&nbsp;
I judge API service providers based upon whether they have an API, and I am increasingly encouraging my readers to do the same. I will also be studying the portability of services that are being sold to API providers, and pushing for more import / export features like Runscope offers.
I will be tracking on the API definitions used by service providers like Runscope, across the 26+ areas I monitor, and trying to better understand the JSON schemas they are using to encourage the portability of their services. The API definition, response, and request models put forth by companies, tells a lot about the service they offer in my opinion, and I'd say the overall portability of services is another strong characteristics I will be keeping an eye out for.

			<p><em>30 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>As I think about the bad behavior that occurs on the API consumption side of API operations, I'm considering ways that I can help API providers address these problems when they arise within their ecosystems. What can you do when bad actors have access to your APIs? Also more critically for some providers, what can you do to prevent bad actors from on-boarding with your API program at all? I strongly believe that companies should be as public with their API efforts as possible, but when it comes to which developers you let in, and which ones you don't, I'm finding I'm becoming more conservative in my thoughts--as long as you are transparent about the process. I'm still forming all of my thoughts around this (hence the blog post), and I'm sure is something that will keep evolving as I continue to push forward my awareness of the API space. When I see a new sign-up for my own APIs, I like to be able to verify who the new consumer is. I like to see a real name, and potentially a company name, but also when I Google the combination, I like to see an active Twitter, LinkedIn, or Github account. It is easy to tell real people, from personas that live n the shadows, and I prefer verifiable people use my APIs. If you are a public API consumer, I do not think it is unreasonable to ask you to maintain some sort of public presence, to verify who you are, and what you do. I know for many enterprise developers this is insanity, which is why I put LinkedIn profiles in the mix--I do not expect everyone to be super popular on Twitter, and a die-hard Github user. However, in 2015, you really should consider! As I'm going through my own API on-boarding process, trying to make smoother (it isn't the best right now), I am considering how I will articulate what...[<a href="/2015/11/30/i-like-being-able-to-verify-a-developer-is-real-before-giving-them-access-to-my-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I am continuing to push my research around API monetization, plans, and partners forward, whilep preparing for my API lifecycle keynote at @Defrag and @APIStrat. Along the way, I am also exercising some of my API pricing and planning strategies with my partner in crime at APIware, as we think through some new products that we are developing.
How I approach pricing for API products, is on a resource by resource basis, considering all of the API monetization tools in my toolbox. For example, when i launch two new API endpoints for exploding API definitions, and telling me how big my APIs are, I quickly run down my list of monetization building blocks to see which areas will apply to these new resources. The reality is, until these APIs leave an alpha stage, they will just exist in my internal consumption tier.
Even though these APIs aren't ready for prime time yet, I am already thinking through which of my API monetization building blocks will apply. Will I charge for access? Are they available in the freemium tier? Do I offer only a trial version of them? Ultimately it all comes down to who I will be targeting with these resources, and in this case it will be primarily hardcore API architects--something that helps me define how I will price these resources, and which service tiers I make them available in.
When it comes to generating revenue from APIs, rarely are there a one size fits all solution. You should be considering each resource based upon the value it brings to the table, who you are targeting with this resource, and weighing all the tools in a modern API monetization toolbox. Remember the business of APIs resembles the technology of APIs, where you do things in small chunks, and you iterate, until you find the optimal value proposition that works for the platform, and your consumers.

			<p>I am still catching up on my feeds, and open browser tabs, and one tab that has been open for a couple of weeks is Why Your Colleagues Still Don&rsquo;t Understand Hypermedia APIs, by Luke Stokes (@lukestokes) of FoxyCart. The post is very thought provoking for me, and represents what I feel is the very pragmatic front of the hypermedia movement, from someone who has helped move the concept of a hypermedia API from academic discussion to reality, with the FoxyCart API. His challenges at the end of his post really set the stage for me: So how do we find a balance between idealism about what Hypermedia API documentation systems &ldquo;should&rdquo; be and what they practically are? How can we move the whole ecosystem forward by encouraging client developers to code to link relationships instead of hard-coded URLs? How do we help pave the way for the future but not look like unsophisticated outsiders in the process? What pragmatic steps should we take to be like the other cool kids using standard documentation presentations while at the same time saying, &ldquo;Um, yeah, don&rsquo;t do that. Don&rsquo;t code to the URL, code to the link relationship instead.&rdquo; For me, his questions illuminate the canyon between where the API community is currently with API design, and the vision of where we should be going with our API design practices. The more I play and learn with hypermedia, the less I see it as the lofty vision for the future, and the more I see it as a set of practical design patterns that will make my API work more meaningful. The shortcomings of API definitions like Swagger (now OADF), is that it was designed for documenting your API, after it was already designed--awesome, but not remotely about API design. Where the concept of hypermedia is all way back the other direction, where you have to put some serious thought into your API design, before you ever...[<a href="/2015/11/30/bridging-how-we-currently-document-our-apis-now-with-how-we-should-be-experiencing-apis-via-hypermedia/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>30 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I'm neck deep in government open data again, and as we are gearing up for the presidential election, you really begin to see the potential for accurate, real-time election data via APIs. There are a number of leading election-related APIs at the federal level like we have from the&nbsp;Sunlight Foundation, and you see the emergence of high value APIs out of government like the&nbsp;Federal Election Commision (FEC) API from the 18F, but with the amount of money in politics, and scope of what is at stake, I can't help but feel there is a huge opportunity out there for more election APIs.
Seems to me that there is an opportunity for some API savvy activistpreneur to step up at the city, county, state, and even the federal level. I'm not just talking about election districts, candidate, and other common building blocks of elections we experience, but real-time sentiment, superpac spending, and other influential information that if availablle for distribution via APIs, could shift the balance one way or another. It would take a healthy assessment of the current landscape, but I think you could identify some low hanging fruit to get started with.
One you get going on the API journey around election data, if you do it right, you will learn a lot, and discover other valuable content or data sources, and see patterns that the rest of might not see. The use of social platforms over the last 8+ years of elections was all API driven, and is just the tip of the iceberg--an API dedicated to elections seems like a huge opportunity to me, in coming months and years.
Let's get to work!

			<p><em>29 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I've always been a strong advocate for the API consumer, which is one of the primary motivations for me working to define best practices that API providers can follow across their operations. The majority of my negative experiences, when it comes to APIs, has been as an API consumer, not as an API provider.
As I do this API Evangelist thing longer, and longer, the bad behavior by API consumers becomes more clear to me, and I'd say rivaling much of the bad behavior by API providers that I have seen, and in some cases helping actually drive it. I do not have any bad actors in my API community, but through conversations I have had with leading API providers, I'm hearing some pretty crazy stories.
Badly behaved API consumers range from signing up for multiple accounts, rather than paying for higher levels of access, to trolling within the community, treating other developers badly, platform owners horribly, and just being a shitty API community citizen. You will never truly understand how badly API consumers can behave, until you've operated an API platform, and had a large number of consumers putting an API to use.&nbsp;
While I will always keep my critical stance towards API providers, as I feel they often set the tone for a community, I am increasingly more understanding when platforms have to tighten things down, and get more critical when it comes to the public availability of API resources. In the end, I will always push for more public transparency around every aspect of API operations, but I am increasingly advising companies to have a tight grip on their API service composition, and what resources developers get access to, before they prove they are trustworthy.

			<p><em>29 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>I recently told the story of how I view the API life-cycle, based upon my research across the space, at the Defrag Conference in Broomfield, CO, and at my API Strategy &amp; Practice conference in Austin, TX. I spent two weeks pushing my research forward in preparation for these talks, and wanted to take a moment to gather my thoughts, and share the narrative of my talk. When I first gave this title and abstract for both the Defrag and APIStrat keynotes, I called it "the 17 stops along a modern API lifecycle". After pushing my research forward, to support these talks, it became 26 stops, then those became what I am calling "lines", resulting in me just call the talk "the API life-cycle". I use my public speaking as a vehicle for my API research, helping me polish my work, and ultimately pushing me to craft better narratives around my work, but most importantly, make it more coherent, and make sense to the average individual. One way that I do this, is to root my stories in history, build upon the earlier work in the tech space, and anchor them to other relevant areas of our everyday lives. Everything I do as the API Evangelist is built on the hard work of men and women who came before me. From the 1940s... The 1950s... The 1960s... The 1970s... The 1980s... The 1990s... The 2000s... Getting us to the current decade, where I saw the potential of delivering the compute resources we needed for the mobile devices, that were quickly becoming ubiquitous in our daily personal as well as business lives. Designing, deploying, and managing APIs in support of mobile was the catalyst for my research as the API Evangelist in the summer of 2010. As the API Evangelist, all that I do is map out what I am seeing across the API space, mapping out what API pioneers like Amazon and Salesforce are doing,...[<a href="/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>I just read The Pill versus the Bomb: What Digital Technologists Need to Know About Power, by&nbsp;Tom Steinberg (@steiny), and I'm reminded of the important role APIs will (hopefully) continue to play in helping provide a transparent window into some of the power structures being coded into the algorithms we are increasingly relying on in this digital world we are crafting. In this century, we are seeing a huge shift in how power flows, and despite the rhetoric of some of the Silicon Valley believers, this power isn't always being democratized along the way. Much of the older power structures is just being re-inscribed into the algorithms that drive network switches, decide pricing when purchasing online, via our online banking, and virtually ever other aspect of our personal and business worlds. APIs give us a window into how these algorithms work, providing access to 3rd party developers, government regulators, journalists, and many other essential actors across our society and economy. Don't get me wrong, APIs are no magic pill, or nuclear bomb, when it comes to making algorithmic power flows more transparent and equitable, but when they are done right, they can have a significant effect. If APIs are a complete (or near complete) representation of the algorithms that are driving platforms, they can be used to better understand how decisions behind the algorithmic curtain are made, and exactly how power is flowing (or not) on web, mobile, and increasingly connected device platforms--API does not equal perfect transparency, but will help prevent all algorithms from being black boxes. We may not fully understand Uber's business motivations, but through their API we can test our assumptions. We may not always trust Facebook's advertising algorithm, but using the API we can develop models for better understanding why they serve the ads they do. Drone operators may not always have the best intentions, but through mandatory device APIs, we can log flight times and locations.

			<p><em>25 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>It can be easy to stumble across the base URL for one of my APIs out on the open Internet. I design my APIs to be easily distributed, shared, and as accessible as possible--based upon what I feel the needs for the resource might be. You can find most of my APIs, as part of my master stack, but there are other APIs like my screen capture API, or maybe my image manipulation API, that are often orphaned, which I know some people could use some help identifying more of the resources that are behind API operations. To help support discovery across my network of APIs, I'm going to be supporting requests for Content-Type: application/apis+json for each endpoint, as well as an apis.json file in the root of the API, and supporting portal. An example of this in action, can be seen with my blog API, where you can look into the root of the portal for API (kin-lane.github.io/blog/apis.json), and in the root of the base URL for the API (blog.api.kinlane.com/apis.json), and for each individual endpoint, like the (blog.api.kinlane.com/blog/) endpoint, you can request the&nbsp;Content-Type:&nbsp;application/apis+json, and get a view of the APIs.json discovery file. It will take me a while to this rolled out across all of my APIs, I have worked out the details on my blog, and API APIs. Providing discovery at the portal, API, and endpoint level just works. It provides not just access to documentation, but the other critical aspects of API operations, in a machine readable way, wherever you need it. It is nice to be on the road to having APIs.json exist as the media type (application/apis+json), something that isn't formal yet, but we are getting much closer with the latest release, and planned releases. Next, I will push out across all my APIs, and do another story to capture what things look at that point. Hopefully it is something I can encourage others to do eventually, making API discovery...[<a href="/2015/11/25/providing-api-json-as-a-discovery-media-type-every-one-of-my-api-endpoints/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>
I am back home in Los Angeles, after another great edition of API Strategy &amp; Practice--this time in Austin, TX. I have had a few day to decompress, and took a day to reboot my brain by crafting 235K+ API definitions for the English language, resulting in some time to reflect on what happened last week in Austin.
First of all I want to thank 3Scale. Without the API infrastructure provider, APIStrat would not happen. Second I want to thank all the sponsor s who get involved, without your support the conversation wouldn't happen. Third, I want to thank the speakers and attendees for making it such a meaningful conversation.
I tend to use that word, "conversation" a lot when describing APIStrat, but I feel pretty strongly that it is the conversation that occurs at APIStrat that helps move the entire API community in a very meaningful way. The conference always renews my energy, and strengthens my relationships with other important folks in the space that I rely on for my research and storytelling.
Thank you so much to everyone who came to Austin last week and participated, and special thanks to Steve and the 3Scale team for investing so much into the API community, while asking for so little in return.

			<p><em>23 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>I needed a side project to reboot my mind after @APIStrat this last weekend, so I opened up my notebook and picked a project that I've been meaning to give some attention to, one that would help me clean my slate, and let me get back to my regular work levels. The project I picked is one that I came up with a little over a year ago, but recently had flushed out my vision further, as I hung out at my favorite watering whole drinking an IPA. It took me several iterations before I landed on a name for this project, but my working title is the English Language API Recipe Book. I find myself in an awkward position these days, when it comes to the concept of API copyright, which is something I have taken a firm stance on with my work around the Oracle v Google ava API copyright case, and the release of the API licensing format API Commons, but is something, in the end, I just do not believe in. You see, in my opinion, API definitions should NOT fall under copyright. Like recipes and menus, API definitions should not be open for anyone to use. To help me make my point, I wanted to craft the English Language API Recipe Book, publishing an open API definition for almost every word in the English dictionary. I found a reasonably complete list of every English word, and auto-generated an Open API Definition Format (OADF) specification for each of the 235K+ words.&nbsp; For each API definition, I cover the base GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs for each word, providing a basic query via a parameter, and return a name, and description as the basic underlying data model. I am already playing with other variations of database models, and have also generated another dimension for each word, by again iterating through each word, and adding it as a secondary level resource.

			<p>
This is the 6th edition of API Strategy &amp; Practice, happening in Austin, TX next week. As one of the organizers, I can say that pulling together the perfect lineup of speakers and topics is always a daunting challenge, but then at some point before the event happens, the schedule always seems to take on a life of its own.
The APIStrat Austin schedule has reached that point again. We have enough killer speakers and companies present, it has attracted other killer speakers and companies, resulting in a mindblowing 3 days of workshops, keynotes, panels, and sessions--if you haven't taken a look at the schedule lately, take a few moments.
I was going through, looking for problems, missing photos, etc, and the scope of the people and companies present just struck me how amazing it has become, and I had to share. If you aren't registered, make sure and do so, and if there is someone you think that should be in attendance, feel free to ping me directly--you won't want to miss it.
See all y'all in Austin next week!

			<p><em>07 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>I've spent a lot of time thinking through the licensing we apply to APIs, as part of my work on the Oracle v Google API copyright case. The licensing around APIs is still in flux, with the current precedent being that APIs are copyrightable. Even though I do not believe this stance, I encourage API designers to make sure and apply one of the more liberal Creative Commons licenses to your API definitions, taking a pre-emptive stance in the conversation. In my experience most API providers, let alone consumers and the public at large, do not understand the separation between an APIs definition, and the code that runs the API, and often even the code that consumes an API. To help us visualize the separation, as well as think through the licensing implications of each layer, I have setup a specific research project that addresses API licensing, in hopes of spending time regularly researching the topic, as well as telling stories that help people navigate how to license their APIs. Here is how I'd break down the five most common layers of the API licensing stack, and some ideas for how you can apply licenses to these layers of API operations. Server Code -&nbsp;For many APIs, your server code will be your secret sauce and kept proprietary, but for those of you who wish to open source this critical layer, here are some options.

			<p><em>05 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>
We reached another significant milestone in the API space today, after being acquired by SmartBear this spring, the Swagger specification is being moved into a Linux Foundation grouped called the Open API Initiative (OAI).
SmartBear has been working with the core group of vendors including 3Scale, Apigee, Capital One, Google, IBM, Intuit, Microsoft, PayPal, and Restlet over the summer to hammer out the details of the organization, and the charter that drives the group forward.
Its no secret, I am a pretty big support of the specification, and happy to see it be reborn, within the community driven group, as a community driven open spec. I&rsquo;m looking forward to continuing my development of interesting things on top of the OADF  specification, and telling stories about what the community is building as well.
If you have a cool tool or service that you have built on the spec, make sure and let me know, so I can share the story with my network.

			<p><em>05 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I wish I had more time to spend on designing, and deploying APIs the way I desired. Without any real funding of individual APIs, I can only go so far with them, which usually doesn't go beyond the minimal viable API. However, even with this reality, I have two APIs I would love to see done right, and keep nagging at me.
One API is my curated news API, which I currently have a pretty bare bones JSON definition to represent each news article I curate from the API space (date, title, author, body, url). As I have time, I've been trying to craft a Siren representation of this same resource. The opportunities for exploration of my archive of curated API news going back to 2011 is pretty huge (in my opinion).
Recently, I've also been having delusions of a hypermedia enabled version of my audio API, which I use store audio files I find, create, or publish. It is a CRUD version of what I'd like to see, but recently I've been thinking of ways I could craft a more audible version of API Evangelist, but in order to do it right, I need a hypermedia enabled API experience.
For me, ,this takes hypermedia beyond many of the discussions I have been exposed to, moving my motivations into the realm of user experience, and not about building a client that will rule them all, or just as a matter of principle--I just want to deliver the right experience. How do I allow consumers of my audio API to define their own experience? How do I craft some experiences, based upon my view of the API space--as I see the world?
This is where hypermedia goes beyond the technical, and moves into the experiential realm where I'm hoping that I can manifest some more money to pay for tehse API designs to become a reality. ;-) Thank you for your support!

			<p>When I started API Evangelist in 2010, I tracked on one area--API management. Over the years this expanding to be about API deploy, and design, and most recently monitoring and discovery. As I approach the end of 2015, I've expanding this to be 30 separate areas of research. I have almost 200 projects I'm pushing forward in one way or another, but these 30 years reflect the API space I am working so hard to make sense of in 2015. While all of my research is a work in progress, I have these core projects as part of my regular monitoring, and I will be updating as much as possible.

I also have other research areas I'd like to merge in here, and maybe some other areas I'd like to to migrate out of existing research, into new areas. As I'm preparing for my keynotes at Defrag in Colorado, and APIStrat in Austin this month, I'm refreshing all of my research, and trying to use my work to craft a hopefully interesting talk, while also sharing some nuggets of wisdom from the vantage point I enjoy. All of my research is licensed CC-BY, is machine readable by default, and runs on Github, so if you have any questions you can submit an issue, or ping me directly.

			<p>I read a lot of blog posts, and press releases about open data these days, and when I find a dataset I think offers a lot of value, or is just interesting enough to help push forward, I either try to incorporate into my Adopta open data work, or I just put it out to my followers to see if anyone can help. As I was monitoring the space yesterday I came across the&nbsp;Ranking Digital Rights 2015 Corporate Accountability Index, which "evaluates 16 of the world&rsquo;s most powerful Internet and telecommunications companies on their disclosed commitments, policies, and practices that affect users&rsquo; freedom of expression and privacy."--I saw there was an excel and CSV versions of the report, but I didn't see an API, so I tweeted out: Done @kinlane https://t.co/f69iFoYgDJ &mdash; SlashDB (@slash_db) November 4, 2015 Victor Olex (@agilevic) from SlashDB, turned around an API endpoint in a matter of a couple of hours. Here is what Victor sent me: I took your Twitter challenge and created the API for Ranking Digital Rights data.

			<p><em>04 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I am a big advocate for making sure the on-boarding process for developers is as friction-less as possible. Developers should be able to signup, and login without anything getting in their way. This is why normally I wouldn't suggest adding anything unnecessary to to signup and login process, but I saw something over at Cloud Elements that I thought was interesting.
First, let me know that Cloud Elements gets bonus points because they emphasize signing in with your Github or Google account. I am a big fan of keeping all my API accounts linked to my Github profile--it just makes sense to me. I'd love it if API providers allowed me to store keys, SDKs, and other resources within my private Github repository, that I use across all the APIs I depend on. (I'm sure someone will tell me not to do this, but nobody has yet to convince me of why)
What really caught my eye logging in, was the updates they provided at the bottom of the login screen. There was an image, with a simple message telling me that v1 of the Cloud Elements API was sunsetting, with a simple "Read More" link, so I can get more details. I like this concept of adding these type of critical updates to the login screen for developers.
I am going to add a flexible messaging area to signup and login screen, as part of my suggested on-boarding building blocks. Developers may not be regularly logging into their API developer portals, so I wouldn't depend on this channel for everything, but in addition to the blog, Twitter, and other channels, it might make sense as a way to share important information with API consumers.

			<p><em>04 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I've had a handful of suggested building blocks when it comes to authentication, as part of my API management research, but after taking a look at the OAuth Scopes page for the Slack API, I'm going to add another building block just for listing out OAuth scopes.
For platforms who provide OAuth, scopes are how access to users content and data is being broken down, and negotiated. When it comes to industry levels, OAuth scopes are how power and influence is being brokered, so I'm going to start tracking on how leading providers are defining their scopes--I am sure there are some healthy patterns that we all can follow here.
I have had the pleasure of sitting in on OAuth negotiations between major utility providers, as part of my work with the White House and Department of Energy&nbsp;in the past.&nbsp;This work has given me a glimpse into the future of how access and sharing of data will be negotiated in the future, with OAuth scopes and APIs playing a central role.
It will take me some time to standardize how I gather, store, and publish the OAuth scopes for each API, but I can get started by bookmarking any provider who shares their OAuth scopes, and encourage other API providers to do, by suggesting a formal OAuth scopes page as one possible building block you should consider when crafting your API strategy.

			<p><em>04 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>
APImetrics just released their second API Performance Report for Social Networks, aggregated from data they have been gathering from monitoring social networks since 2014. APImetrics is publishing the report to "..understand the impact these APIs were having on social media based on geographic location and specific cloud service provider."
I'll let you read the report yourself, I just wanted to highlight the importance of this type of API monitoring from 3rd party services like APImetrics. The other providers I watch closely like Runscope and API Science also monitor 3rd party APIs like this, but I think publishing formal reports on a regular basis like APImetrics is doing, is healthy for the space.&nbsp;
Eventually, I would like to see an aggregate location where all API monitoring service providers can publish their data, in a common format, and the larger API community could process, and help establish an API rating solution that we can all take advantage of. Historical, and real-time data will be key to establishing the open rating system that we need.
I would say that social, cloud, and messaging apps kind top the list of APIs we should be monitoring and rating, but eventually it would be nice to have this be commonplace for any public API in the space. Part of helping us evolve the API discovery conversation, is establishing a baseline for rating the good APIs from the bad ones, and work like the social network report from APImetrics helps us get closer to this possible future.

			<p><em>03 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I love that AWS is baking monitoring testing by default in the new Amazon API Gateway. I am also seeing new service from AWS, and Google providing security and testing services for your APIs, and other infrastructure. It just makes sense for cloud platforms to incentivize security of their platforms, but also ensure wider success through the performance and load testing of APIs as well.
As I'm reading through recent releases, and posts, I'm thinking about the growth in monitoring, testing, and performance services targeting APIs, and the convergence with a growth in the number of approaches to API virtualization, and what containers are doing to the API space. I feel like Amazon baking in monitoring and testing into API deployment and management because it is in their best interest, but is also something I think providers could go even further when it comes to investment in this area.
What if you could establish a stage of your operations, such as QA, or maybe production testing, and the compute and bandwidth costs associated with operations in these stages were significantly discounted? Kind of like the difference in storage levels between Amazon S3 and Glacier, but designed specifically to encourage monitoring, testing, and performance on API deployments.
Maybe AWS is already doing this and I've missed it. Regardless it seems like an interesting way that any API service provider could encourage customers to deliver better quality APIs, as well as help give a boost to the overall API testing, monitoring, and performance layer of the sector. #JustAThought

			<p><em>03 Nov 2015</em></p>
			<p>When planning the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference, the team works very hard to make the speaker and session line up reflect what we see across the API space. The conference is meant to be an open, non-vendor and non-product focus, discussion about what individuals and companies are facing when it comes to being API providers, as well as API consumers. When we closed the call for papers for APIStrat this year, it was clear that API consumption would be one of the sessions, but &nbsp;as we progressed in the process of locking down talks it was clear that API consumption should be something that we should move to the main stage. To help highlight the importance of this discussion, I wanted to ask Mark Boyd (@mgboydcom), the conference chair for APIStrat his thoughts on why we did this: This year has seen two major API consumption challenges: For API providers looking to continue their growth, 2015 has often been about putting their API in front of non-dev users and making their API accessible to a wider audience. We're seeing an increasing use of tools like Google Sheets and slackbot integrations trying to make API functionality available to people who don't code. For businesses and enterprises generally, the increasing use of external APIs has meant more challenges for dev teams in aggregating APIs and using multiple APIs consistently. Each API they are using might come with different terms of service, differing rate limits, different terminology for the same subject matter, and different ways of measuring units. For example, most API consumers I hear from are frustrated that each API they use seems to have a different way of measuring and displaying time formats! As APIs keep growing in mainstream business use, there becomes a tipping point in scaling the API economy where it starts adding complexity rather than removing it. We think that 2015 is that tipping point and we need to start solving how...[<a href="/2015/11/03/api-consumption-moves-to-the-main-stage-at-apistrat-austin-this-month/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>Many of you that have attended any of my talks, have heard me tell the audience about the importance of sharing your API stories. As an API provider it is the most important tool in your toolbox, above and beyond any technical or business advantage you have. I'm spending more time lately, gathering up the things I say over and over in my talks, and other in-person conversations, and craft simple stories that echo these little nuggets of wisdom on the blog. If you do not tell the story of what your API is doing, nobody will know--it really is that simple. The drumbeat from your blog, should echo the activity that is going on via your API. Your day might be filled with a hectic stack of activity from your view, but your API consumers, analysts, and storytellers like me, we do not see any of this activity, and we all need to hear about your day on your blog, amplified by your active Twitter account. I can tell you that the APIs who are doing interesting things, and are telling the story of these things, end up on my blog, and in the major tech blogosphere much more often, than those that do not. I'm not telling you to craft amazing essays about your operations, I'm just asking that you blog daily, or every couple days, on the often mundane, but potentially highly valuable stories from the trenches of your API operations--it is something that, the more you do, the easier it wil gets. While the goal of blogging is to communicate externally with your API consumers, and the public at large, my secondary motive is to expose you to a very beneficial by-product of blogging in this way. When you get into a rhythm where you are working through your ideas, operations, and API road-map, in such a public way, you develop a very different view of your platform, one that is...[<a href="/2015/11/02/please-tell-your-api-stories/">Read More</a>]</p>

My objective is to keep track of how the APIs I track on operate their partner programs, resulting in the list of organizations I reference in my research. I also want to try and identify what some of the common building blocks of API partner programs are, in addition to the news stories that I have curated about partnerships--which is the fuel of my research.

I got that this afternoon in a Tweet from Leah Bannon, reminding me how important it is for me to have stories for non-developers. Tools that make it easier for non-devs to do stuff with APIs are the most under appreciated and awesome things in tech right now imho &mdash; Leah Bannon (@leahbannon) November 3, 2015 There are many tools available right now that let's anyone publish an API, you just have to know the right tools, and right process to get the results you need. Thanks to Zapier, you can connect to the API driven services of a wide variety of cloud tools, and using Google Spreadsheets and Zapier, you can easily store data and content, to be used in a simple API--all without writing any code. The most useful example of this, is using popular form services like Wufoo, Gravity Forms, Typeform, and Survey Monkey, you can collect just about any information you want, crafting exactly the form and fields you want, then using Zapier you can route the form results to a Google Spreadsheet. Once you have your Google Spreadsheet, you can then easily publish an API, complete with documentation using Restlet's cloud API deployment, and management services. I'm going to save the detailed how-to for a future post, but I wanted to kick-start, what I hope to be an ongoing series, of simple exmaples of how non-developers can consume and publish their own APIs, without being a programmer. My goal is to help encourage anyone to understand the value of aggregating valuable data and content using Google Sheets, and then allowing it to be put to use anywhere, by deploying an API with Restlet.

			<p>I have some really amazing resources exposed as APIs. Everyone is doing it these days, and I have some good ones, now I just need a plan. You know, actually, I need several plans, that will help me expose these resources to the right people, while remain as much control as I need, and also generate revenue from these resources, tailored to whoever I am offering them to. Starting With The Essential API Building BlocksI want to allow anyone to access my valuable APIs, however I want to control exactly how much they can access, and even limit it to a free trial, and a small amount of calls upon the API. I am going to call this Plan A, also known as my freemium layer, meant to just wet the appetite of any potential API consumer. I ow have a basic level of access to my API resources, that anyone can sign up for 24/7, yet I get to dictate exactly how many hits on the API they can make, and who gets access. Moving Beyond Plan A For My API StrategyPlan A only gets me so far, I need to also be able to establish additional plans that help me cover the costs of my operations, and hopefully also generate some revenue from API access and usage. I need to be able to establish any number of plans that I will need to be successful. Each additional plan that I offer, lets call them plan B, C, and D, should have the ability to sign-up 24/7 without approval, possess a trial version option if necessary, and allow for charging of setup costs to get going--if I so choose.

			<p><em>31 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>API rating is a conversation I have several times a year, with different groups, and is a conversation that seems to occurring with a little more frequency in recent months. How do we know which APIs are the good ones? What constitutes a good API? How do we measure whether a contract (the API) is being adhered to, by both API provider, and potentially the consumer as well. How will we establish the Standard &amp; Poors or Moodys for the API economy? These are the API rating conversations I am having with folks. These are all great questions, and something many companies have approached me looking help in solving, with nobody moving forward with this in a meaningful, and sustainable way. So to help apply some CPR to the subject, I am going to explore API rating some more, from my own point of view, in hopes of guiding some existing conversation I'm already having on the subject, and also hopefully generate some new ones. I want to quantify where we are at with this problem, what work I've put into, and maybe establish an open blueprint that the community might be able help run with. Starts With API DiscoveryBefore we will ever have a usable approach to API ratings, we are going to have to also work on our API discovery problems. We have one open format, designed to not just index the technical side of APIs, but also the business, and political side of operations--APIs.json. The problem is we haven't reached a critical mass where a machine readable index of API operations is available for most of the public APIs available, as well as private indexes of the APIs that exist behind the firewall. It will take time, but soon, every actor in the API economy,&nbsp;from Fitbit, up to&nbsp;the International Trade Administration, will have&nbsp;APIs.json indexes&nbsp;of their API operations.&nbsp; Next, What Makes A Good API?There are many things that goes into making an API...[<a href="/2015/10/31/how-are-we-going-to-create-the-standard-and-poors-and-moodys-for-the-api-economy/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p>After writing&nbsp;I Have A Bunch Of API Resources, Now I Need A Plan, Or Potentially Several Plans, and&nbsp;How Are We Going To Create The Standard And Poors And Moodys For The API Economy, I wanted to combine what I had learned while crafting these stories, and try to look at how these two areas could work together. The API plan and pricing research is derived from existing approaches to API service composition introduced by providers like 3Scale, however the rating portion is fresh territory for me, with very few precedents to follow. What I see when I start wading through a structured approach for API providers to craft meaningful API plans to serve up their API resources through, and how developers will be paying for API usage, via the apps they build, I begin to see the potential of a structured approach to API plans, and pricing. When you start thinking of the implications across providers, and consider the opportunities for developers to manage API consumption across API providers, and exchange the credits they purchased, or generated via API usage--a potential blueprint for an economic engine for the API space begins to emerge.&nbsp; I wanted to explore this concept, by crafting a visualization, and ponder how common approaches to API plans, and pricing, could be complimented by a standardized API industry rating system. The only thing really original in this diagram, is the introduction of an API rating system, and the potential for developers being able to exchange credits between the API service providers they depend on. The rest of this standard API management approaches, that are defined by API providers like 3Scale. If you aren't familiar with modern approaches to API service composition, API providers can have many different API resources, as well as many different plans for subscribing to these API services, which provide a wealth of dimension for API providers to define, price, and limit how developers put API resources to use...[<a href="/2015/10/31/after-combining-my-api-plans-pricing-and-rating-research-i-see-hints-of-an-api-industry-economic-engine/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>29 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>There are number of areas across the API life-cycle that are being expanded upon in the current space, thanks to the evolution of API definition formats like Swagger, API Blueprint, and RAML. One area I haven't seen as much growth as I'd like, is in the area of visualizations driven by API definitions.&nbsp; There are two distinct pools of API definition driven visualization: 1) Letting you visualize the surface area of an API 2) Letting you visualize the resource made available via an API. One area my friend the @APIHandyman has been exploring is around the surface area of API. @APIHandyman has a nice prototype created that he is calling "Swagger Specification Visual Documentation". The API Definition driven visualization uses A D3.js visualization to help you explore the surface area of any API that is defined using Swagger. I have written about API definition driven visualizations before, so I am happy to see the concept being pushed forward, as we have a lot of iterations to cycle through before we find a visualization format(s) that works for different API designers, architects, and developers. The visual documentation that @APIHandyman created runs on Github, and he is looking for feedback on the micro tool, and where he should take it next. He recently added a bigger information display area, but could use the communities ideas on how to make it more useful. This type of work is a time drain. Every time I started playing with Swagger + D3.js I would lose an entire evening, and have very little to show for work, so I know how valuable feedback can be. I strongly feel that API definition driven D3.js visualizations will be the future of API design, management, and orchestration. APIs are going to continue to grow in number, and scope, and we will need simple, visual ways we can quickly traverse the landscape, and makes sense of things.

I'm calling this one an HTTP Status Code Clinic, which would be an API definition driven API service provider (why would you do it any other way in 2015), that would help API providers tailor more useful, and meaningful HTTP status codes. HTTP Status Code Clinic would be a simple software as a service, complete with its own API (why would you do it any other way in 2015), and CLI for operating as well. You would pass it a Swagger, API Blueprint, RAML, or any other API definition format, and it would return a bunch of feedback on HTTP status codes returned (or not). The process could anchor the feedback in the current API design, while also providing HTTP status code education along the way. The service would have to get crafty around how it walked through an API, requesting sample data, or requiring default values for query parameters, headers, body, etc. If it was done well it could be done as a kind of wizard that walked the user through each endpoint, what was returned, and might be better solutions, as well as additional status codes that could be used. You could also include examples from popular APIs like Twilio, Twitter, and others, to show what is possible. I recommend you do this as a standalone service. While it might be nice to have as part of an existing service provider stack, I think it makes more sense to offer as a standalone clinic / service that API providers could use when they are ready. API designers and architects could make it part of the API design and definition portion of their life-cycle, as well as integrate into their existing systems using...[<a href="/2015/10/29/an-api-idea-http-status-code-clinic/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>28 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>One of the discussions we are having behind the scenes at APIWare.io, is whether we should be hand-crafting, or auto-generating SDKs for the clients we are working with on the design, deployment, and management of their APIs.&nbsp; The answer is easy--we do both!&nbsp; There are many situations where I would push for the API SDKs to be hand-crafted, and designed for a specific API, as well as specific language or platform. However, with the increase in the number of APIs, and simplicity of some of the APIs I work with, crafting an API definition, and auto-generating your SDKs using a service like APIMATIC, makes sense. I've cracked open the APIMATIC SDKs, and only being fluent in JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, and C#, I can only speak to these realms of operation, but I'm happy with what the APIMATIC team is producing. For me, this isn't a black and white game, it isn't hand-crafted vs. autogenerated--it is how you employ both approaches across your API operations. APIMATIC provides high quality SDKs in 10 languages, some languages I do not speak. The APIWare.io team has a wealth of programming talent on the team, and while we could hand code libraries across these areas, for all of our clients, for many of the more straightforward APIs, it just makes sense to generate. We are already an API-definition first shop, where we craft Swagger, API Blueprint, RAML, or other required API definition format, so using this to generate SDKs makes sense in many situations. Are you trying to figure out the best path forward for providing high quality SDKs for your API?Llet me know how my APIWare team can help. They are willing to help you figure out the best route for providing the SDKs you need, but also help maintain them as part of the versioning, and overall roadmap for your API operatins.

			<p><em>28 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>I have been writing some fictional stories on a project site I have called Alternate Kin Lane for some time now. Writing fictional stories in the tech space has provided a sort of pressure release valve for me, giving me a quick creative outlet throughout the week. Honestly, there are more stories in my notebook, than there are on the actual blog, but this is a sign for me that I need to spend more time working in this area. I am making several shifts in my work lately, in response to kind of hitting the wall recently, a process that includes rethinking how I work on projects, and partner with folks in the API space, as well as an increased focus on the fictional side of my writing. I do not just want to write fiction that is derived from the tech space. I want to write fiction that helps me formulate my own view of the space, and who knows, maybe influence the space in similar ways my regular tech blogging has over the last five years. If you aren't familiar with the concept of design fiction, it "is a method of critical design that uses fictional and narrative scenarios to envision, explain and raise questions about possible futures for design and the society." Up until now I was just dumping some random, crazy ideas into my fiction notebook, and taking the time to publish a few of these on Alternate Kin Lane. Now I'd like to try and bring a little closer to my daily API monitoring and research, and see if I can use to explore concepts around the tech, business, and politics of the API space--which is touching pretty much every aspect of our personal and business lives in 2015, leaving a pretty wide playing field. I think some of my writing on Alternate API Evangelist will be just as dark as some of the stuff I've written on Alternate...[<a href="/2015/10/28/adding-a-new-research-area-to-api-evangelist-i-am-calling-apidesignfiction/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>As I go through each of the 20 core areas of the API sector that I am keeping an eye on, in preparation for my keynotes at @DefragCon and @APIStrat, I'm taking a fresh look at which of them have APIs. When you think about it, if a company is selling a product or service to API providers, encouraging an API focus--they should probably have APIs. :-) As I was updating some of the news, companies, and reviewing the common building blocks I have aggregated across the 20 areas of research, I just poked my head around to see if I could find an API for each service provider. There are many things that look like a language specific API, but I am looking for a clear developer / API area, with a coherent web API available, as we'd expect from API providers in 2015. After spending a couple hours looking through my core research, I found the following service providers, in the follow areas, actually had web APIs available: Definitions APIMATIC API Transformer Deployment Amazon API Gateway Orchestrate.io Tyk Kong Microsoft Azure Containers Docker Kubernetes Scraping Kimono AlchemyAPI ParseHub DNS CloudFlare Akamai AWS Route 53 ARIN DNS Made Easy DNS Simple StatDNS Management 3Scale Apigee Tyk API Umbrella Github Gluu Microsoft Azure Kong SDK APIMATIC Monitoring Runscope API Science Tyk API Metrics Pingdom Status Page Testing Runscope LoadImpact Loader.io Discovery Google API Discovery Service APIs.io ProgrammableWeb IDE Codenvy This was my first pass through all of my core research looking for APIs, so I am sure I missed some--let me know which ones I missed. My design, hypermedia, performance, monetization, evangelism, embeddable, client, SDK, visualization, and virtualization didn't have any clear leaders who had easy to find APIs. I will update as I find them--which smells like an opportunity to me. Eventually I'd like to see some common definitions to be established across all these areas of the API space, but as you can...[<a href="/2015/10/27/which-api-service-providers-across-the-20-areas-i-track-on-have-apis/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>27 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I was talking through the features, and roadmap for SecureDB with their team the other day, and one of the conversations that came up was around on-premise opporutnities for deploying encrypted user, data, and file APIs. In my opinion, on-premise is something that has morphed from meaning "in our data center", to where wherever we store data and run our compute power--which could be spread across multiple cloud vendors.
SecureDB offers an extremely valuable API commodity in 2015, encrypted user, data, and file stores--something EVERY website and mobile application should have as part of their back-end. When you have something this valuable, and potentnially ubiquitous, it needs to run wherever it is needed. With this in mind SecureDB is available on demand, as a retail API solution, but they will also deploy it for you "on-premise" on AWS or Heroku, with "more platforms in the roadmap".
While a wholesale, on-premise, deploy anywhere API will not be required for all APIs, as some SaaS solutions won't benefit from this type of distribution, if you are a core architectural building block, or utility APIs like SecureDB, to compete in the API economy, your API will have to deployable to anywhere it is needed. With the explosion of Docker and Kubernetes, your API should technically be able to able to be deployed in any containerized environment, with a business model, licensing, and legal framework to support the different use cases.
The ability to deploy your API on Heroku is just a gateway drug to the wholesale, white lable, containerized, API economy that is coming, where the most agile, flexible, and interoperable APIs will dominate.&nbsp;

			<p><em>27 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>
As you probably know, I'm always up for learning about APIs, so when @Darrel_Miller and @GBlock started doing their In the Mood for HTTP podcast, I was all in. Both Darrel and Glenn are API experts, and respected leaders in the space, but more importantly both of them are super nice guys, and reflect a tone I love to experience and support across the API space.
The format for In The Mood For HTTP is simple. The audience asks questions, and Darrel and Glenn discuss. They are both very graceful in how they answer questions, extremely knowledgeable on the subjects at hand, but they are also very opinionated, and they don't always agree--the exchange between them is educational, and very benefitial to the wider API community.
The API duo has quickly produced three episodes. I am listening to episode three as I write this post. My only critique of the podcast is I'd like to see better indexing of the episodes, with easy text version of the questions, and a link to that specific time in the Youtube videos. I'd love to have a library of these organized in a sort of API FAQ, that I can share with my readers, and reference throughout my storytelling.
I'm going to explore how I can get more involved, and provide some questions, and help drive their conversations. I've enjoyed doing this with Traffic and Weather, and other API related podcasts that have emerged. On this note, I encourage anyone to create their own podcast in the space, and explore finding your voice when it comes to conversations in the API space. I know many voices across the space, who I hear at API conferences like @APIStrat and @APIDaysGlobal, which I'd like to hear in more real-time, as Darrel and Glenn are doing--if you do, I'll help support!
Keep up the good work you guys!

			<p><em>27 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>
As I've written several posts on the recent Amazon API Gateway release, one of the side things I noted about the API solution from AWS, was that API monitoring is baked in by default. As stated on the AWS API Gateway page:
After your API is deployed, Amazon API Gateway provides you with a dashboard to visually monitor calls to your services using Amazon CloudWatch, so you see performance metrics and information on API calls, data latency, and error rates.
This may seem like common sense to many people who have been in the API space for a while now, but for many API designers, architects, developers, and business folk who are just getting going, API monitoring may not be default for all implementations.
To me, AWS baking in API monitoring by default, demonstrates that the world of API monitoring has matured, marking an important milestone that all API providers should pay attention to. I've been watching this space grow over the last couple years, and similar to the API management space, the AWS release reflects the overall health of the API sector.
If you are operating any API In 2015, monitoring should be standard operating procedure, alongside your API documentation.

			<p><em>26 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>It can be difficult to know where to start when it comes storytelling around an API. Many of us who have been in the space, have followed the lead of Twitter, Twilio, Amazon, and others, but when you are new to the space, knowing where to start can often be paralyzing. This is something I am regularly helping clients and partners think through, and while&nbsp;I'm thinking through the topic with SecureDB, I figured I'd share the details with you my readers. If you are unfamiliar with how the API Evangelist network operates, I have common building blocks available for almost 20 core stops along the API lifecycle. However, when many of my partners and clients are just getting going, they are often overwhelmed by the volume of data I provide, so I regularly find myself tailoring, and distilling down a specific strategy for each conversation I engage in. I wanted to help SecureDB understand where they can start with evangelism from day one, by providing a 101 list for API evangelism, but before I could do this, I needed to make sure they had a few API building blocks in place first. Wait...before we got going with a 101 API evangelism list, let's make sure the most essential element is present? Value&nbsp;- Check! Encryption for all your data in this climate is critical. Now, let's make sure the minimum viable&nbsp;API management building blocks&nbsp;are in place to support evangelism efforts: On-boarding Portal -&nbsp;Check. The SecureDB product is their API,&nbsp;so the website is their portal.&nbsp; Getting Started -&nbsp;Check. There is a&nbsp;simple quick-start&nbsp;to get developer up and running. Self-Service Registration -&nbsp;Check. There is a simple,&nbsp;self-service signup&nbsp;for the &nbsp;platform. Documentation API Definition -&nbsp;Check.

			<p><em>24 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>An API key management service targeting Drupal developers came across my radar this week. The service is very focused, in that it is a Drupal module, and is focused on helping Drupal developers manage the keys they use across a single app or installation, but I think it represents a potentially larger trend. I think this particular solutions is just a symptom of a growing problem for developers of any type--how do you manage the number of keys you are depending on for you application(s). API consumers are in need of a plug and play way of to store, access, and manage the increasing number of API keys they put in use, otherwise we will be looking at a pretty serious security problem, adding to the existing security issues API providers and consumers face. If you need evidence of the viability of API Key management solutions, AWS has one. Ok, why don't developer just use AWS? Well they should if it makes sense, but we also need other competing, and complimentary key management solutions, to ensure a healthy API space. Not all users are going to need full-blown IAM solutions, they just need a simple, encrypted place to put all their keys, and some utilities to help them manage them.&nbsp; Personally, I store my keys in a JSON config file stored in the private Github repo for any application I develop, and for each org, I have some crude API key management utilities to help me manage turnover. My server apps can cache the config file locally, and my client side apps run on Github Pages, using SSL, and Github OAuth to open up API key access they need. I will be keeping an eye out for more API key management solutions, and begin the process of documenting the building blocks of these product and services, like I do with other areas.

			<p>Shortly after the Zypr voice API came on to the scene in 2011, I launched my research into voice APIs. Like many other areas of the API universe, voice has come in and out of focus for me, something I think will take much longer to unfold, than any of us could have ever imagined. Zypr quickly ran out of steam, and other similar solutions have come and gone over the last couple years as well, leaving my research pretty scattered across many different concepts of how voice and APIs are colliding--lacking any real coherency. I took a moment last week to take a fresh look at my voice API research, because of a comment by Steven Willmott (@njyx), the CEO of 3Scale. Its not an exact quote, but Steve spoke about how voice is the future of API consumption, after he had attended the AWS:Reinvent in Las Vegas. I agree with him. Voice APIs is a topic that has been significantly stimulated with the&nbsp;introduction of the Amazon Echo platform, but I also feel also coincides with a critical mass of available API driven resources that will deliver some of the value these platforms are promising users. Voice recognition has always been something that leaves a lot to be desired--think Siri. Even with these challenges there are many dimensions to the voice API discussion, and with the amount of resources now available via simple APIs in 2015, I feel we are reaching a more fertile, and friendly time for voice solutions to return the value end-users desire. We now have a rich playing field of weather, news, stocks, image, video, podcast, and other data, content, rich media, and programmatic resources, which can be linked to specific voice commands--something we didn't have before. While there is still so much work to be done, but I agree with Steve's vision, that voice will play an increasingly significant role as an API client. I would add that like...[<a href="/2015/10/23/voice-as-the-next-generation-api-client/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>23 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>I've been tagging companies that I come across in my research, and stories that I find with the term "orchestration" for some time now. Some of this overlaps with what we know as cloud-centric orchestration using Puppet or Chef, but I am specifically looking for how we orchestrate across the API lifecycle which I feel overlaps with cloud orchestration, but pushes into some new realms. As I'm carving off my orchestration research, I am also spending time reviewing a newer breed of what I'm calling API hubs, workspaces, or garages. Over the last year, I've broken out IDE research from my overall API Discovery research, and SDK from my API Management research, and client from my API Integration research. In parallel with an API-centric way of life, I want all my research to be as modular as possible, allowing me to link it together into meaningful ways that help me better understand how the space works, or could work. Now that I'm thinking terms of orchestration, something that seems to be a core characteristic of these new&nbsp;API hubs, work spaces, or garages--I'm seeing a possibly new vision of the API life-cycle. I'm going to organize these new hubs, work spaces, and garages under my IDE research. I am starting to believe that these new work spaces are just the next generation IDE meant to span the entire API life-cycle--we will see how this thought evolves. This new approach to API IDEs gives us design, and development capabilities, but also allows us to mock and deploy APIs. You can generate API documentation, and SDKs, and I'm seeing hints of orchestration using Github and Docker. I'm seeing popular clients like Postman evolve to be more like a API life-cycle IDE, and I'm also seeing API design tooling like Restlet Studio invest in HTTP clients to expand beyond just design, adding live client interaction, testing, and other vital life-cycle elements. None of my research is absolute. It is...[<a href="/2015/10/23/reconciling-my-api-orchestration-research-with-the-evolution-of-ide-sdk-and-http-clients/">Read More</a>]</p>

I am keynoting APIStrat in Austin next month, and it is a big deal for me. Ok, its my event, and I probably shouldn't be that excited, but it is the first time I've ever keynoted it. ;-) It is the sixth edition of APIStrat, and Steve asked if I wanted to keynote, which I dismissed because it seemed too ego, but when he pushed back, I realized that I would be stoked to keynote.
I'm excited about the preparation for the talk, and trying to think about how I can incorporate my research, and working API operations into it. I'm also keynoting Defrag the week before, so both my keynotes will march in lockstep. They won't be the same keynote, but they will reflect what I'm seeing across the API space right now, allowing me to use both venues as vehhicle to move my research forward.&nbsp;

My Defrag talk is titled, "The 17 Stops Along The Modern API Lifecycle", which I'm guessing will grow as I prepare both these talks, but it will also be the same core theme of my APIStrat keynote. Over the last five years, the API space has been slowly coming into focus for me, and in 2015 I feel like I'm really starting to see some coherency in how things are working together, making for a clearer API life-cycle for me to reference.
Storytelling on my blog helps me work through my ideas, and doing it on stage at Defrag and APIStrat will help me organize them in a way that can benefit the entire API community. I haven't been this excited about two talks in a while, and I'm looking forward to sharing where my research has gone in 2015, on stage at two conferences I really enjoy supporting.
See you in Broomfield and Austin folks!

			<p><em>23 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>I started playing with the possibilities when it comes to API deployment using virtual containers like Docker early this year, exploring the constraints this approach to API deployment introduced, on my own infrastructure. The process got my gears turning, when it comes to deploying very simple data, content, and algorithmic APIs into any environment that runs Docker.&nbsp; As 2015 has progressed, I'm seeing containers emerge as part of more stops along the API life-cycle, specifically in deployment and virtualization. A new one that just came across my radar is API PLUG. I haven't played with the containerized API deployment solution yet, but after watching video, and looking through site it seems in line with what I'd expect to see from a next generation, containerized, API deployment solution. Overlapping with my previous post on reconciling API orchestration, I'm seeing several stops along API lifecycle present in API PLUG, beyond just API deployment, it allows you to design, deploy, and document your API which moves well into the world of API management. As I'm seeing with other emerging solutions like API Studio from Apigee, I predict we will see testing, monitoring, and other critical layers of the API life-cycle emerge as orchestration layers of API PLUG. I've added API PLUG to my API deployment research, and I am still considering the best way to include them in other areas of my API research. I'm increasingly finding that modern API management solutions are spanning multiple areas of the API life-cycle, which further encourages me to modularize my research, but also tells me I'm going to need to create some sort of Venn Diagram visualization to help me better understand the reach of emerging API products and services. Anyways, more to come on API PLUG as I play with, and listen to the stories they tell via their blog, Twitter, and Github accounts (I can only find a Twitter account, but I'm sure they are working on that! ;-)....[<a href="/2015/10/23/api-plug-a-new-containerized-api-design-deployment-and-documentation-solution/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>
Marketing your products and services in the API sector can often look very different than marketing of products and services in other sectors. Developers are a very different target audience, and to make things even more complicated, not all developers are created equal! Open developer are not like the enterprise developer, and healthcare developers won't have much in common with device-based, Internet of Things developers.&nbsp;
How to market your API has been a session at every APIStrat since we did the first conference in New York City back in February of 2013, and we just announced the latest edition of marketing for APIs at @APIStrat in Austin in November. Here is the lineup we have for this round:





Thursday Bram (@thursdayb)
Urgency Inc.





Matt Gordon (@esquivalient)
Expected Behavior





Adam Duvander (@adamd)
Orchestrate.io





Kristen Womack (@kristen_womack)
LeadPages




With the session being chaired by:




Jennifer Lankford (@jenlankford)Crowd Supply, Inc.&nbsp;(Session Chair)



The marketing session at @APIStrat is one of the tracks that is meant for API users of all types, from business to developer, and is something that should be attended whether you are at a startup, or leading things in the enterprise.&nbsp;
There is less than a month left before @APIStrat Austin 2015, so make sure and get registered before tickets are sold out.&nbsp;There are also still a couple of keynotes left to announce, so stay tuned for some last minute highlights.
We'll see you in Austin, November 18th, 19th, and 20th.

			<p>It has been a year or two since I've given any deep thought to the Twitter ecosystem. There has been such little meaningful action to come out of the social platform over the last couple years, I had all but given up on it being a platform with any sort of future for developers. When Jack Dorsey apologized and solicited feedback from the community this week, I honestly felt I didn't have much to offer when it comes to advice--I just wasn't prepared. Twitter does almost everything right when it comes to their developer ecosystem...well on the surface, where they do fail, is within the most critical areas of API operations: Communication&nbsp;- Twitter communicates about the usual mundane API platform stuff, but really lacks a tone and substance that really cuts through the BS for developers. In my opinion it will take years to recover from the tone set by Dick Costolo &amp; Ryan Sarver--they just did not respect developers at all, and it showed. This isn't something you recover from quickly. Access &amp; Rate Limits -&nbsp;While communications around access level and rate limits have gotten much more clearer, with a dedicated area in dev portal, and available inline within documentation, it will take going the extra mile before developers feel like there is truly a level playing field. It will require more API access to account level usage, notifications, dashboards, etc. to heal these wounds--real-time communication. Business Model -&nbsp;There is just no clear business model evident from the developer ecosystem--something that showcases how Twitter is making money, where the API fits into this, and the opportunity for developers to play in this game. I've broken down the pricing confusion involved with using the REST API, and Streaming API, and tried to understand across the different levels of access--even though my research is dated, the confusion still exists. There is no clarity when it comes to how I can grow my usage of Twitter (as...[<a href="/2015/10/22/if-twitter-can-deliver-transparency-around-api-access-and-business-model-they-might-be-able-to-find-their-way-again/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>I just had a call with one of my newer API partners, working with them on crafting version 1.0 of their API evangelism strategy, and the subject of what content to generate, and which channels to use, when building up their brand arose. In my work, about 90% of the approaches I see implemented by API providers is a traditional PR strategy, where you create content, and push to popular channels to do the work of syndicating the message. While this approach works, and is something I recommend you do, I have a different way of building up my brand, and the partner or community brands that I invest in. All of this begins with something that truly brings value to the table for everyone involved, without this, my approach will not work. Once you have something of value, you start working directly with this value, building things, experimenting and playing, while telling the story all along the way. If it isn't something you'd use yourself, and be able to innovate with, why would you expect anyone else to. If value truly exists around products, services, and tooling associated with a brand, you will build momentum with each story you tell, eventually encouraging others to do the same. An example of this in the wild is with the fast growing API definition Swagger. I started paying attention to Swagger closely in 2011, and by mid 2014 I had gone all in with Swagger, and integrated into my own platform, and tooling, resulting in 265 stories that reference swagger over the last four years. Let me show the value driven by this type of storytelling--here are the plotting of my stories over the last four years: Here is a plotting of growth of the Swagger according to Google Trends: This is how you build brand awareness organically. I'm not saying I'm solely responsible for Swagger's success--it all started with the value brought to the table by...[<a href="/2015/10/22/how-to-build-an-api-brand-through-consistent-storytelling/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>22 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>One layer I am working to add to my API research, are machine readable API definitions that I find, or generate from the APIs of the API service providers I keep an eye on. Within this new layer I'm aggregating these API the specs of the companies who are offering services within the emerging areas of the API sector. The first area I've started aggregating is within API management. 3Scale was very forward leaning with their willingness to open up their API definitions for their own API management infrastructure APIs. These are API specs that describe all of the features of the 3Scale API management platform, and represent one possible blueprint that API management service providers could emulate. I have four separate API definitions included from 3Scale on my new page, something that could be broken down further if it makes sense. I also just added a suggested API definition for API portals--crafted by the APIMATIC team. They thought my idea for defining a common set of definitions across the 17+ areas I monitor was an interesting cenough oncept, and was something they wanted to explore further with me. Zeeshan Ejaz Bhatti of APIMATIC pulled together this spec: &nbsp; &nbsp; This is just one potential starting point for providing a common interface for managing your API portal. Zeeshan feels that , if "API-Portals-as-a-Service", and other API management providers agreed on a common publish API format, it would benefit other API service providers like APIMATIC who are providing services to their customers via these API portals. I agree with Zeeshan, and might&nbsp;play around adding an API facade for managing your API portal using Github + Jekyll, like I do with my standard API Portal template. This is all work in progress. Right now I am just aggregating the API definitions for API service providers that have APIs. In my opinion this layer of the API space will differentiate API service providers from each other, demonstrating which...[<a href="/2015/10/22/adding-a-suggested-api-definition-for-api-portals-to-my-api-management-spec-collection/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>16 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I have used the&nbsp;Federal Agency Directory API&nbsp;for quite some time to lookup federal government agencies. USA.gov has some highly valuable, and simple APIs including the&nbsp;Social Media Registry API, which I find extremely useful. They recently added a new one for searching government websites that do not end in .gov.
The Non-.gov URLs APIs allows you to search for all websites that end in .com, .org, .edu, or other top-level domains, including:

Federal, state, local,&nbsp;tribal, commonwealth, and territorial government agency websites
Federal reserve banks and branches
Federal home loan banks
Libraries, archives, and museums, including&nbsp;Presidential libraries
Department of Defense websites for&nbsp;recruiting&nbsp;and&nbsp;service academies
Travel and tourism&nbsp;websites for states and U.S. territories
State lotteries
Cooperative extensions
Combined federal campaigns
Government sponsored enterprises&nbsp;(such as Fannie Mae) [PDF]
Federal and state retirement systems
Task forces (such as the Preventative Services Task Force) and commissions (such as the 9/11 Commission)
A few select, non government organizations (such as the Red Cross) and public-private partnerships



I find the APIs coming out of USA.gov to be excellent examples of what ALL government agencies should be doing. The APIs don't have to be complicated, just provide simple read, and sometimes write access to valuable government data that should be public.
I am going to prioritize the creation of an API definition for USA.gov, and wrap their APIs in an APIs.json file, and add to my federal API stack. The more of these APIs I have at my disposal, the more efficient I am at when it comes to opening up government data, and making existing API resources available across my research.

			<p><em>16 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>I've been working on expand upon my API security research, but it can be difficult to find API focused security solutions. Exactly what is security when it comes to APIs can vary. Are you looking to secure your APIs? Are you looking to secure your data or content using an API? This is why I started a research projects so that I can turn on my keyword monitoring, and begin scouring the landscape in real-time--the more I conduct research in an area, the better I get at it. The best part of my research is that sometimes when I write about things, companies just come to me. This happened the other week, with an encrypted database API provider called SecureDB. What this brand new API driven platform provides is default security for your&nbsp;accounts, data, files, and settings--exactly what we need in this cyber-insecure world we have created for ourselves. I do not store any sensitive data, but if I did, I would not want to be in the business of storing it. Period! SecureDB gives you everything you need to manage your users account and identity, create the data stores you need, and store your appilcations files and settings in a secure environment. All identity data is encrypted by default, and you get to set the encryption levels for all your data stores, allowing you to make sure everything sensitive is not readable on the server, even if it is compromised. SecureDB is just getting started, but they have a lot of things in the works, including on-premise, containerized implementations, version that run on Heroku, white label solutions, and much more. I will be working with them to help them craft a marketing and storyteling strategy around their encrypted database solution, and establishing a deeper partnership between them and API Evangelist. I'm pretty stoked on my ability to attract these types of API service providers just by publishing my research regularly, and talking about the...[<a href="/2015/10/16/an-api-for-encrypted-storage-of-all-your-accounts-data-files-and-setting/">Read More</a>]</p>

			<p><em>15 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>It is up to API providers to establish a coherent approach regarding how they rollout and manage their APIs, something that historically has just involved deploying and managing, but in the last couple of years we have seen more formal approaches emerge, something we are all calling the API lifecycle.&nbsp; In 2012, after we started standardizing our API development and management thinking using API definitions, the expansion of the API lifecycle was set into motion with the introduction of an API design-first way of thinking from the Apiary team. API definitions allowed us to get our development and management house in order, but also begin collaborating, mocking, and having a conversation around our API designs, way before we began the costly process of writing code. In 2015, I am tracking on API definitions driving over 17 separate stops along this fast evolving API lifecycle. While some API providers who are further along in their API journey are incorporating all of these stops, many API providers who are just getting going, are still learning about all the stops along this modern API lifecycle. Part of this evolution is establishing just exactly what is your companies API lifecycle, something that can be a very personal thing, and we'll need more of our tooling to help us quantify this. This is why I was happy to see evidence of API lifecycle management built into the tooling with the new AWS API Gateway. In my earlier post on the&nbsp;potentially very powerful API orchestration with the Amazon API Gateway: Going beyond the types of integration you can employ when crafting, and deploying APIs using the Amazon API Gateway, the platform also provides a way to define stages that APIs will exist in from design, development, QA, production, or any other stage you wish. I like the concept of having a stage defined for each API, designating where it exists on the API life-cycle.

			<p><em>15 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>I mentioned the concept of what I call API building blocks coming to life by API service providers yesterday. These are the features provided from API service providers that are made accessible via APIs. Mind blowing right? API service providers having APIs? Which then allows API providers to programmatically manage the operations of their own APIs? Who would have ever thought!! Actually it is a pretty clear example of API service providers who are kind of full of it, when they do not offer their own APIs--meaning they are telling you about the importance of APIs, but not actually practicing what they preach. It is kind of like API providers who do not use their own APIs in their applications (dogfooding). Anyhoo. I have done a lot of work to define the common building blocks across API service providers, spanning over 17 stops along the API lifecycle, and part of the next phase of my research is to connect these building blocks to actual API definitions that can help automate these vital API features. First up, I took the 3Scale API, and generated this list of common building blocks represented in the API for their API infrastructure.

			<p><em>14 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>
Maybe I've looked at too many APIs, but I feel that APIs are very telling of the overall culture of a company. APIs that are trusting, tend to open up a full stack of APIs, including POST, PUT (or PATCH), and DELETE functionality, giving developers access to all, or nearly all functionality available via a platform.
I do not feel that platforms are required to open up everything, but the amount of what they open up, does tells a lot about how a company is thinking. While I find many companies are not fully up to speed on the benefits a modern API management strategy, and the control it gives you over resources and API consumers, I think many just do not trust anyone outside the firewall, and think they know best when it comes to everything.
APIs are not for every company, and I do not think everybody should have any API, but I do want API providers to be aware of how telling their approach will be about their motives behind having an API. You should not see this as a negative lesson, it will help you think about your company from the outside-in, this is one of the most important aspects of the API journey in my opinion.
A journey you should begin as soon as possible, if you think you can make it work in a positive way.

			<p>
NASA just launched two new APIs, as part of their open data efforts. I find the APIs they offer to be simple, and very inspirational examples of what an API can be. Maybe I just love space, but seeing these well designed, very fun APIs out of our countries space agency is just cool.
They added a Near Earth Asteroids API, and a Mars Rover Photos API, and they also understand the value of telling the story of the release on their blog. Remember API providers, if you launch an API in the woods and don't blog about, nobody will know about it--storytelling is one of the most important tools in your toolbox.
Also, your APIs don't have to be complicated, and overthought. Just providing GET access to interesting images and other content like NASA is doing can really go a long ways in generating attention (it got me to write a blog post). You can see this in action with both their APIs, and their approach to their API portal--I look forward to seeing what APIs they release next!

			<p><em>14 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>
I wrote about the ability to convert between multiple API definition formats using API Transformer&nbsp;the other day, a solution being developed by the APIMATIC team, and shortly after posting, the LucyBot team pointed out they are working on a similar tool. This is one of the reason I try to write these posts, it always brings folks out of the woodwork.
It is good to see multiple efforts out there. Converting of API definition formats is a fast growing need for both API providers and consumers, something that is only going to grow with the adoption of popular API definition formats. I feel it is a healthy sign that standard tooling for converting common API has emerged, and an even better sign that there will be a diverse selection in this tooling.
It looks like the Lucybot converter is a little behind API Transformer, but I'm sure they will get caught up soon. I'm eager to see how these API definition conversion service providers keep up with each version of API definitions as they evolve, as well as new players who enter the game. If they can do successfully they will possess some very valuable data around which API definitions are being put to use by API providers and consumers.

			<p><em>13 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>
If you have followed my work since 2010, you know I pull out what I call the common building blocks of originally just API management, but over the last five years this has grown to 17 areas of the API life-cycle. My goal is to better understand the common features offered by API service providers, but only the ones that will also matter to API consumers at the same time.
In the last couple months I started tracking on how these API building blocks match to actual APIs offered by the API service providers I monitor. What do I mean? Well, when you consider the common building blocks offered offered by API management providers, these building blocks come to life when you look at the API offered by 3Scale.
Moving down the lifecylce, you can see this in action with the Runscope API in the area of API monitoring. The RunScope API allows API providers and consumers to realize API monitoring and testing in a programmatic way, going beyond the web interface they provide to their users. While the features available via RunScope, and via the APIs are not a one to one match, they represent a very important start.
This is where API providers become API consumers, accessing common building blocks they will need to operate their platform. This is also where API providers practice what they preach, and also become API providers, in addition to just selling services to API providers--an important distinction that separate the API service providers who are further along in their journey.&nbsp;
If you are an API service provider, and do not offer an API to your customers, matching as many of the features available in your interface, my prediction is you won't last long in the current fast moving landscape.

			<p><em>10 Oct 2015</em></p>
			<p>One of the things that really bothers me in the API space is when API service providers are too competitive, establish silos, don't use APIs themselves, and refuse to provide interoperability with other service providers. It is the API space y'all, this shit needs to work together, if we expect anyone to buy into what we are selling--if you aren't confident of the product you are selling, you probably shouldn't be in business. This is why it makes me happy to see the work 3Scale has done in integrating their own API infrastructure with AWS API infrastructure. You can find the details of the integration opportunity over at 3Scale, but I want to focus on the subject of API service providers working together, even if it is externally augmented like 3Scale did, as opposed to formal partnership. Within weeks of AWS launching their API Gateway, the 3Scale team was not only unfazed by the potential competition from the cloud giant, they immediately got to work understanding how their own infrastructure could compliment the offering. There is an overlap between the AWS API Gateway, and 3Scale infrastructure, but both platforms bring an immense amount of value to the table, and it is very forward thinking of their team to see this, rather than just sit around worrying about what AWS would do to their business. 3Scale has an eight year head start when it comes to API management, and AWS brings some serious API deployment power to the table with their new Lambda platform. What 3Scale has done, represents how API service providers should behave in the industry. I have lots of experience in trying to get API service providers to work together, and participate in a conversation on stage at events, something that can like getting a group of toddlers to play together. To me, what 3Scale is doing demonstrate their confidence in the infrastructure they are selling.
