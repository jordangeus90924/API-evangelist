{% include JB/setup %}<p>Ive heard this story several times now, but I think its a story worth telling over and over.It is the story of the Netflix API and the lessons they learned along the way.Not every API owner will be operating at the scale of Netflix, but the lessons are universal.It all started when Netflix set out to build an API, where the original charter was: Expose Netflix metadata and services to the public developer community to let 1,000 flowers bloom.That community will build rich and exciting new tools and services to improve the value of Netflix to our customers.</p>
