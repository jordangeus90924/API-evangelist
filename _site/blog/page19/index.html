        <p><a href="https://github.com/explore"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/github_explore_showcases.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Github has long been my number one source for discovering people doing interesting things with APIs. As I was trying to articulate how API providers can put Github to work as part of their API operations in another story, I came across <a href="https://github.com/explore">the Github Explore section</a>. I thought that the list of items on the home page helps demonstrate that Github is more than just about managing open source code--which is the common perception regarding what you do with Github amongst muggles.</p>
<p>I feel that these nine areas reflect the top uses for Github in 2017:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/policies">Policies</a></strong> - From federal governments to corporations to student clubs, groups of all sizes are using GitHub to share, discuss, and improve laws.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/tools-for-open-source">Tools for Open Source</a></strong> - Software to make running your open source project a little bit easier.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/open-source-organizations">Open source organizations</a> </strong>- A showcase of organizations showcasing their open source projects.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/design-essentials">Design essentials</a> -</strong> This collection of design libraries are the best on the web, and will complete your toolset for designing stunning products.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/social-impact">Social Impact</a> -</strong> Open source projects that are making the world a better place.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/open-data">Open data</a> -</strong> Examples of using GitHub to store, publish and collaborate on open, machine-readable datasets.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/package-managers">Package managers</a> -</strong> Across programming languages and platforms, these popular package managers make it easy to distribute reusable libraries and plugins.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/devops-tools">DevOps tools</a> -</strong> These tools help you manage servers and deploy happier and more often with more confidence.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/machine-learning">Machine learning</a> -</strong> Laying the foundations for Skynet</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other galleries available via <a href="https://github.com/explore">the Github Explore section</a>, but I think this list provides a nice snapshot. I was pleased to see open data as a showcase, which included the <a href="https://apis.guru/">APIs.guru API directory</a>, something I'd like to see become an entire category of API catalogs and directories. It also makes sense that the foundations for Skynet are being laid using Github as part of its machine learning showcase.</p>
<p>It is important to also note that the first area on this list is policies. Providing some important leadership for city, state, and federal government agencies to follow when it comes to crafting policy in an observable way via Github. While not an antidote for all the illnesses of government, it provides an environment where the sunshine&nbsp;can be let in to disinfect the process just a bit.</p>
<p>While code is still the central focus of engagement on Github, I think the open data,&nbsp;machine learning, and policy galleries reflect the shifting landscape of what happens on Github. I'm investing some time into crafting more Github 101 stories for API providers and consumers, and will also be improving my own discovery process using the social platform, as there are numerous signals to tune into these days, and the explore galleries is one interesting layer&nbsp;that I'll be keeping an eye on regularly.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-question-mark.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Mike Ralphson&rlm; (<a href="https://twitter.com/PermittedSoc">@PermittedSoc</a>) asked me the other day, "<a href="https://twitter.com/PermittedSoc/status/847814927792451586">if you could run SQL / #GraphQL queries over nearly 50K #API definitions, what would you ask?</a>". I told him I would respond via blog post, which is one way I help amplify the conversation I have with other API folks in the space. Mike is doing som important work when it comes to API discovery, something that needs amplification&nbsp;if we are going to move this conversation forward.</p>
<p>Ok, so what would I ask of nearly 50K API definitions, if I had the opportunity to ask? Here are some of my answers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What are all the paths used? -</strong> I'd like to see a list of all path folders, separated by the&nbsp;forward slash, minus any parameters.</li>
<li><strong>What paths folders&nbsp;actually are words? -</strong> I'd like to know how coherent API design patterns are, and how many are actually words in a dictionary.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>What are all the tags applied? - </strong>A listing of all tags applied to APIs, with counts for each time it is used.</li>
<li><strong>What are all the parameters? -</strong> A listing of all the parameters applied to APIs, with counts for each used.</li>
<li><strong>What are all the definitions -</strong> A listing of all definitions used as part of API requests and responses, with counts next to each.</li>
<li><strong>How many don't have definitions?</strong> What percentage of the API definitions do not have definitions describing their responses</li>
<li><strong>What businesses are involved?&nbsp;</strong>- A listing of all companies involved with API definitions from contact information to domain ownership.</li>
<li><strong>What is whois information behind each domain(s)? -</strong> Pull whois information for all the domains involved in API definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Which definitions do not have path summary or description? -</strong> Which definitions have omitted the description for the path.</li>
<li><strong>What's</strong><strong>&nbsp;the average length of path summary and descriptions? </strong>- Of the definitions with a description or summary, what is the average length?</li>
<li><strong>How many APIs provide a link to terms of service? - </strong>Checking to see if a term of service is part of the definition.</li>
<li><strong>How many APIs provide contact information for an API?&nbsp;-</strong> Checking to see if contact information is part of the definition.</li>
<li><strong>How many APIs describe their headers? -</strong> Looking for specific headers described as part of each path definition.</li>
<li><strong>How many APIs use the body as part of their request? -</strong> Looking for heavy body use as part of the request surface area of an API.</li>
<li><strong>How many APIs have a security definition? -</strong> Which of the APIs has provided a definition for how an API is secured?</li>
<li><strong>How many APIs do not use response codes? -</strong> Which of the APIs do not provide response codes for their API responses?</li>
<li><strong>Which API response HTTP status codes used? -</strong> Provide a list of API response HTTP status codes used, with counts for each.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is a starting list of what I'd like to ask of 50K API definitions. It is something I'd have to think and write about more to be able to come up with more creative questions. I recommend publishing them all to a Github repository and let people start asking questions via an interface. You might not be able to answer all of the questions, but it would be interesting to see what people want to know--I am sure you could develop a pretty interesting look at how folks see API discovery, and what they are looking for.</p>
<p>API discovery is one of the areas of the API life cycle that is pretty deficient due to how people view their APIs and how they often have their blinders on regarding the wider API community. Most folks are thinking about their APIs, and maybe a handful of other APIs they are familiar with but do not consider API usage across industries, or the entire space. We need more work like this to occur. We need more API definitions to be made available, as well as more dynamic ways for folks to discover, understand and learn about APIs that already exist.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/04/11/openapi-as-an-api-literacy-tool/">OpenAPI As An API Literacy Tool</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">11 Apr 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/learning_tag_cloud.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I've been an advocate for <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a> since it's release, writing hundreds of stories about what is possible. I do not support OpenAPI because I think it is the perfect solution, I support it because I think it is the scaffolding for a bridge that will get us closer to a suitable solution for the world we have. I'm always studying how people see OpenAPI, both positive and negative, in hopes of better crafting examples of it being used, and stories about what is possible with the specification.</p>
<p>When you ask people what <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a> is for, the most common answer is <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com">documentation</a>. The second most common answer is for generating <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com">code and SDKs</a>. People often associate documentation and code generation with OpenAPI because these were the first two tools that were developed on top of the API specification. I do not see much pushback from the folks who don't like OpenAPI when it comes to documentation, but when it comes to generating code, I regularly see folks criticizing the concept of generating code using OpenAPI definitions.</p>
<p>When I think about OpenAPI I think about a life cycle full of tools and services that can be delivered, with documentation and code generation being just two of them. I feel it is shortsighted to dismiss OpenAPI because it falls short in any single stop along the API lifecycle as I feel the most important role for OpenAPI is when it comes to API literacy--helping us craft, share, and teach API best practices.</p>
<p>OpenAPI, API Blueprint, and other API definition formats are the best way we currently have to define, share, and articulate APIs in a single document. Sure, a well-designed hypermedia API allows you to navigate, explore, and understand the surface area of an API, but how do you summarize that in a shareable and collaborative document that can be also used for documentation, monitoring, testing, and other stops along the API life cycle. </p>
<p>I wish everybody could read the latest API design book and absorb the latest concepts for building the best API possible. Some folks learn this way, but in my experience, a significant segment of the community learn from seeing examples of API best practices in action. API definition formats allow us to describe the moving parts of an API request and response, which then provides an example that other API developers can follow when crafting their own APIs. I find that many people simply follow the API examples they are familiar with, and OpenAPI allows us to easily craft and shares these examples for them to follow.</p>
<p>If we are going to do APIs at the scale we need to help folks craft RESTful web APIs, as well as hypermedia, GraphQL, and gRPC APIs. We need a way to define our APIs, and articulate this definition to our consumers, as well as to other API providers. This helps me remember to not get hung up on any single use of OpenAPI, and other API specification formats, because first and foremost, these formats help us with API literacy, which has wider implications than any single API implementation, or stops along the API life cycle.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/oxford_prototype_questions.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Establishing a feedback loop with your API community is one of the most valuable aspects of doing APIs, opening up your organization to ideas from outside your firewall. When you are designing new APIs&nbsp;or the next generation of your APIs, make sure you are tapping into the feedback loop you have already created within your community, by providing access to the alpha, beta, and prototype versions of your APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/">The Oxford Dictionaries API is doing this with their latest additions to their stack of word related APIs</a>, by <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/our-data">providing early access for their community with two of their new API prototypes that are currently in development:</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Oxford English Dictionary (OED)</strong> is the definitive authority on the English language containing the meaning, history, and pronunciation of more than 280,000 entries &ndash; past and present &ndash; from across the English-speaking world. Its historical record of the English language is traced through more than 3.5 million quotations ranging from classic literature and specialist periodicals to film scripts and cookery books.</li>
<li><strong>bab.la</strong> offers quick and easy translations and answers to everyday language questions. As part of the Oxford Dictionaries family, it provides practical support to people using a language that is not their mother tongue.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get access to the new prototypes, <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/our-data">all you have to do is fill out a short questionnaire</a>, and they will consider giving you access to the prototype APIs. It is interesting to review the questions they ask developers, which help qualify users&nbsp;but also asks some questions that could potentially impact the design of the API. The Oxford Dictionaries API team is smart to solicit some external feedback from developers before getting too far down the road developing your API&nbsp;and making it available in any production environment.</p>
<p>I do not think all companies, organizations, and government agencies have it in their DNA to design APIs in this way. There are also some concerns when you are doing this in highly competitive environments, but there are also some competitive advantages in doing this regularly, and developing a strong R&amp;D group within your API ecosystem--even if your competitors get a look at things. I'm going to be flagging API providers who approach API development in this way&nbsp;and start developing a list of best practices to consider when it comes to including your API community in the design and development process, and leveraging their feedback loop in this way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/oxford_university_press_blue_circuit.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/04/10/my-oxford-dictionaries-talk-about-the-world-of-apis/">I recently gave a talk to the API group over at Oxford University Press</a>. During the discussion, one of their team members asked me about the paradox of what I was advising as&nbsp;the API Evangelist. He was speaking of the dangers of opening up APIs, establishing logging and awareness layers for all the data, content, and algorithms being served up as part of everything we do online. My prepared talk for the conversation was purposefully optimistic, but the conversation also was about the realities of all of this on the ground, at a company like the <a href="http://global.oup.com/?cc=gb">Oxford University Press</a>--making the conversation a pretty good look at the paradox of API evangelism for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/12/why-i-still-believe-in-apisthe-2017-edition/">I still believe in the potential of APIs</a>, although I'm increasingly troubled by how APIs are used by technology companies. So it is easy for me to slip into the optimistic&nbsp;API Evangelist, over the hellfire and brimstone API Evangelist, when crafting talks with groups like the Oxford University Press. The Oxford Dictionaries API is easy to get excited about, even though I"m not entirely excited about the areas I'm informing them about like <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com">voice</a>, <a href="http://bots.apievangelist.com">bots</a>, and machine learning. It is easy to focus on the good that APIs can do at an organizations like Oxford University Press, understanding that they are mission focused, and will be bringing meaningful solutions to the API space, but I would be negligent if I didn't discuss the challenges and dangers of doing APIs.</p>
<p>I want the Oxford Dictionaries API to be successful. I want them to be able to generate revenue so they can keep doing interesting things, and I want them to sensibly do APIs and protect the valuable resources they possess, that they have invested so much time into creating and maintaining. When I recommend that they do APIs, and log every API call being made by applications on behalf of users, I know that they will use this power responsibility and develop awareness&nbsp;around usage, and not exploit their position--something I see from other API providers. The Oxford University Press is a well established, reputable, and mission-driven&nbsp;organization--I want them to be successful on their API journey.</p>
<p>I do not study and evangelize APIs because I think everyone should do APIs. I evangelize APIs to encourage companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies who doing good things to be more successful in what they are already doing, but in a more open, collaborative, and observable way. I evangelize APIs because the cat is out of the bag, and we are already connecting computers, mobile phones, and other devices to the Internet, and it is extremely important that we do it in a secure, yet observable way, that is sustainable for everyone involved--not to just get rich by exploiting 3rd party developers, and the end-users of the applications they build.</p>
<p>I can't make companies do APIs in an ethical way. All I can do is stay up to speed, no..stay ahead of what people are doing, and lead them in the right direction. I am looking to convince, and even trick some of them into being more open and observable with the way they deploy technology, be more open and honest with their business model, and how they think about everyone's privacy and security. Ultimately, I don't want people to do APIs unless it makes sense. I don't think we should be connecting everything to the Internet, however when we do, I want to be here to help companies understand the best practices of doing APIs on the web, and help groups like the Oxford University Press be successful, even though I am perpetually being reminded of the paradox of doing my API Evangelist work.</p>

<p><em>This is from a conversation I had with the Oxford Dictionaries API team last week while in Oxford. I led a conversation with 30-40 folks across several teams at the Oxford University Press offices.

I talked for about an hour, with another hour of discussion with the group, where we discussed some of these areas in more detail.</em></p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/history-of-apis.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>History of APIs</strong><br />To help connect the dots of where the world of APIs is going I wanted to take a brief walk through the history of APIs and make sure everyone is up to speed. The current wave of web APIs began in early 2000's with SalesForce, Amazon, and eBay leveraging web technologies to deliver commerce related IT services that leverage web technology over traditional enterprise approaches. These early API efforts focused on the integration of CRM, sales, and auction or affiliate related commerce activity, following the first dot-com bubble. Then around 2003, a new type of companies emerged that was employing APIs to connect people online&nbsp;and help them share links, images, and other social content, over the buying and selling of products. Flickr, then Facebook and Twitter emerged as API pioneers, opening up simple web APIs that allowed their communities of developers to integrate, and develop new websites and applications that helped drive the social evolution of the web.</p>
<p>By 2006, API pioneer Amazon had internalized APIs at the commerce giant, requiring internal groups to use them to conduct business internally at the company, something that would result in a new web service for storing information on the web they called Amazon S3. Shortly after they released Amazon S3 they also launched a second API for deploying and managing servers on the Internet, changing how companies can deploy infrastructure for the web--something we now collectively call cloud computing. This is when the web API thing became real for many across the tech sector, as APIs weren't just about commerce or social activities, you could actually deploy global infrastructure using APIs. Cloud computing is something that would transform how we do business on the web, changing how we delivered web applications, but would also bring IT out of the basement of the enterprise, and onto the web to operate in "the cloud"--setting the stage for the next transformation of computing occurring via mobile phones.</p>

<p><strong>Web, Mobile, and Beyond</strong><br />Early APIs focused on the syndication&nbsp;of data and content via the web. By 2009, this was changing how we think about computing, something that was greatly aided by the cloud which was put in motion by Amazon's early API efforts. In 2007, Apple introduced their new iPhone to the world, and by 2010 application developers were working hard to develop APIs that could deliver valuable resources to mobile applications, providing what was needed for applications being sold through the Itunes marketplace, and consumed via each wave of smartphones. With the introduction of the Android operating system from Google, the world of computing was clearly no longer just on our desktops, or even via our laptops--our digital bit would now be needed anywhere, in our hands, and via a growing number of Internet-connected devices.</p>
<p>APIs had enabled a whole new approach to delivering resources to mobile applications, as well as allowing these applications to interact with the camera, gyroscope, and other physical features of popular smartphones. This way of thinking about computing would quickly spread to other devices that we would eventually strap to our bodies, install in our homes, cars, and across the landscape of our personal and professional lives. APIs helped deliver content and data to websites, but they were also now driving mobile applications, and now the companies were realizing the potential of connecting sensors, and other devices across a variety of industries, setting the stage for what has become known as the Internet of Things. In 2017, this approach to connect everyday objects to the Internet is helping the Internet penetrate our personal and professional lives, changing how we think from healthcare to transportation. While not all of this connectivity is proving to benefit everyone involved, posing some significant security risks, it is continuing to change how we think about and engage with Internet technology in our lives.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/oxford-web-and-api.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Website + Dev Portal</strong><br />Along this evolution in computing, companies were realizing that APIs weren't just the latest technological trend, and that they were the next iteration of the web, making the web something we just didn't consume, that it was also something that could be programmed, and tailored for each user or&nbsp;device connected to it. Similar to how companies were struggling with the need to have a website during the years between 1995 and 2000, between 2010 and 2015 many companies were realizing that they needed to have their digital resources available via APIs, accessible via a developers portal, where consumers could find what they needed to put valuable data, content, and algorithms to work, adding a wholesale layer to the web. These central portals often live alongside a companies website, changing how a company does business, opening them up to a new way of thinking&nbsp;if the right building blocks were present.</p>
<p>Some companies and startups quickly realized that there was more to all of this than just having APIs. If they also included documentation, code, and other resources, as well as a variety of communication channels and support features, some new and exciting possibilities often emerged. Providing APIs on the web via a rich, informative, and helpful portal would eliminate many of the bottlenecks&nbsp;and polarizing elements that traditional IT operations are often known for. When you opened up your digital assets, made them easily accessible to all stakeholders, and potential consumers, new things were possible, shifting how companies do business, and opening up new opportunities, that might not have occurred behind the corporate firewalls, and the often toxic environments that had developed&nbsp;within the IT environments of previous generations.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/api-product-innovation-platform.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Innovation &amp; Serendipity</strong><br />API pioneers like SalesForce, Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, and others demonstrated that opening up your digital resources via APIs could enable new and exciting things to occur. In 2006, Twitter launched as a simple website where you could signup, follow people, and "tweet" out messages, six months later they launched the Twitter API and developer portal, and everything else we know as Twitter today was developed by the community. A growing number of technology startups quickly saw that APIs were enabling a new type of innovation, one that allowed 3rd parties to safely and securely use valuable digital resources&nbsp;and develop new web, mobile, and a variety of other integrations and applications. The API approach was fueling innovation that might never have occurred within a company and has the potential to service long tail ideas that teams might not have the time or resources to tackle.</p>
<p>The API approach to doing business was allowing for a form of digital serendipity to enter the picture, allowing for new and beneficial ways of putting digital resources to work. When information has only IT gatekeepers the opportunity for power struggles, and other damaging events to occur, can significantly increase. When there are self-service, yet secure access to resources, complete with identification, logging, and reporting, a much healthier balance to accessing digital resources can often be established. Those of us who are too close to digital resource management are often blinded by the immediate needs of day to day operations, and cannot see the possibilities, or even have the room to breathe and dream about what is possible. More open approaches to web APIs allow for 3rd parties who are free from the operational burdens to ideate, experiment and iterate until they find new applications that can bring some positive change to a platform and it's users.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/oxford-partners.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Internal &amp; Partners</strong><br />While web APIs employ the same technology that the web operates on, and often have publicly available developer portals alongside websites, the APIs aren't always publicly available to everyone. Making corporate resources for use by partners the number one reason companies publish APIs in 2017, providing self-service, often plug and play access to data, content, and algorithms, as well as access to applications developed by 3rd part developers, and even to much-needed developer talent that is available within API ecosystems. An API-first approach allows business groups to quickly get access to the resources they need for partner engagements often without actually having to get the approval of, or wait for IT groups to weigh in, making business development, and the development of projects much more efficient, without the friction, often experienced in the past.</p>
<p>Amazon's experience with APIs gave us the cloud, but the way they internalized APIs within the company has famously given the rest of us a blueprint to use in thinking how API resources are put to work internally. Jeff Bezos, the Amazon CEO, mythically directed all of his employees to use APIs for internal interactions, standardizing how departments shared resources--again, bypassing classic bottlenecks introduced IT organizations. Many of the tools and applications developed on top of an API allow for even non-developers to put resources to work, allowing business groups to do more, with less, bypassing IT, and the need for highly technical talent in many scenarios. APIs are shifting how companies are doing business on the web, engaging with partners, and internally between disparate groups, setting the stage for thinking about different approaches to doing business.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/Jigsaw-Puzzle.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Modular &amp; Portable</strong><br />The process of API design involves taking often large systems&nbsp;and breaking them up into smaller, more reusable chunks. The process of doing this helps us think through how we define, store, share&nbsp;and put our digital resources to work. Breaking up digital assets into smaller pieces is one of the things that contributes to the innovation, and reuse described previously, allowing individual resources to be put to work, without the dependencies and legacy constraints that are often introduced by their creators and operators. This modularity allows for innovation to occur at the hand of 3rd parties, but also allows for the evolution of individual resources, without having to do major system-wide upgrades, allowing for change to occur in smaller, more management chunks. This modular way of thinking is what has allowed API pioneers like Amazon and SalesForce to dominate and take the lead, as they are able to move much faster than their competition.</p>
<p>The modular way of thinking that APIs can bring to the table has also quickly spread to all parts of the software stack, changing how we deploy databases, our APIs, as well as the applications that are built on top of them. This evolution of API-driven cloud computing has brought us more containerized approaches to deploying and managing resources, as well as helping us develop more modular and portable versions of our applications. This modular approach to delivering architecture has helped concepts like microservices, DevOps, and continuous integration flourishes, allowing for change to occur at a more individual component level, something that is enabling us to deploy infrastructure and applications anywhere, making operations more portable. Through the standardization of containers, APIs, schema, and the other building blocks of the space, we are now able to deploy infrastructure wherever we need, in any cloud, and on any device.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/zapier-ipaas.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Automation &amp; iPaaS</strong><br />It is commonplace to think about 3rd party developers building the web and mobile applications on top of APIs, but it takes more work, imagination, and exploration to understand the potential for automation and integration using a new breed of integration platform as a service (iPaaS) platforms. This is another area that APIs are empowering non-developers to put APIs to work, bypassing IT and the need for more specialized technical talent. This is another area that is proving difficult for many API providers to think about when it comes to what iPaaS providers like Zapier bring to the table, and how to target complementary APIs, process, and workflows that would benefit business operations. Integration is often perceived as a resource intensive, and costly IT project, but this new breed of platforms make integration something anyone can achieve, with projects that can range from a permanent implementation to a solution that is more ephemeral, going away after just a couple of hours, or after a single event occurs.</p>
<p>Most companies encourage developers to make a request for data, content, and algorithmic behavior using their APIs, but the providers who are further along in their API journey don't rely on APIs just being a one-way street, and have begun employing approaches like using webhooks to make API engagement a two-way street. Webhooks allow for other systems to be called via APIs when specific events and circumstances have occurred. The primary need for doing this is to alleviate the number of API calls that developers will have to make on any single API, but the secondary motivation is often about the orchestration and automation using API resources we depend on. Webhooks allow API providers and consumers to automate common business tasks, scheduling them to occur on a regular basis, or being triggered when a specific situation occurs, making the web much more automated and working for whoever is in defining orchestration.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/bots.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Messaging &amp; Bots</strong><br />APIs are driving development across a variety of business verticals, and one of those sectors that are being changed in some interesting ways is messaging. Enabling users to communicate via a variety of API driven messaging protocols is at the heart of successful platforms like Facebook Twitter&nbsp;and Slack. These API providers are leading discussions when it comes to enabling users to collaborate and communicate&nbsp;while also encouraging developers to get involved using their APIs. An example of the automation described above can be seen in the latest wave of bots to emerge via Facebook messenger, as well as the Slack messaging platform. Bots are small, automated, API-driven scripts that engage with users via messaging platforms, exposing data, content, and algorithms in a conversational format, and hopefully augmenting human interactions in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Bos are emerging to help users answer common questions, automate tasks, make payments, receive analysis, and many other digital aspects of our professional lives. Slack is leading the charge when it comes to business use cases, but Twitter and Facebook are also fueling the potential of bots when it comes to influencing the news, stock markets, elections, or just providing entertainment by delivering poetry, jokes, or funny pictures and memes. Messaging between humans is not new, and messaging between systems within code is also nothing new, but we are now seeing a convergence of these two worlds fueling human to computer interactions at a scale we haven't' experienced before, with (some) interesting outcomes. Like the&nbsp;web and mobile, bots need APIs to deliver the data and content they need to engage with users&nbsp;and emulate human behavior via this new wave of conversational interfaces.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/voice-conversational.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Voice &amp; Conversational</strong><br />Similar to the messaging bot evolution discussed previously, there is another layer of API driven conversations going on, but this time is leveraging actual voice technologies, allowing humans to talk with the web and other online, API-driven systems. Voice enablement isn't anything new, but with the increased availability of API resources, and the advancement of voice technology like Siri and Alexa, having a conversation with a machine is becoming more common. The latest breed of voice solutions translate voice recordings into text, send that text to a variety of API driven systems, and then translate the response back into a familiar voice that responds to humans via their Internet-connected devices. The availability of cloud resources has significantly contributed to this latest explosion in voice-enablement, making it no surprise that Amazon is leading the charge with their Alexa enabled API ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voice enablement is another area that API providers, who are further along in their API journey are making their APIs available for, crafting endpoints specifically for use in voice, and studying how end users are putting voice&nbsp;technologies to work at home, in automobiles, and in the workplace. Like iterating API operations for mobile usage, conversational interfaces will require the iteration of API resources, something a modular approach to design will aid considerably. Web APIs have gone a long way to simplifying some often very complex back-end systems, making them more intuitive and usable by end-users. This is something that will help determine which APIs are usable in a conversational environment, requiring APIs to be able to speak more fluently to humans, but it will be a fine balance&nbsp;because in order to scale properly they also need to be machine readable as well.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning</strong><br />Historically, most APIs have been about sending and receiving data or content, with a handful of APIs providing access to more algorithmically focused resources. While these APIs do have data inputs, they are more about applying some sort of computational solution, with data just being the byproduct. This approach to delivering API resources is seeing the significant resurgence with the evolution a growing number of what services that are being labeled Artificial intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML). While the hype around these solutions often exceeds the reality, some of these API resources are providing some very valuable computational resources that can be used in everyday tasks. There are numerous startups emerging to cater to this new wave of Ai and ML solutions, with technology giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and even IBM investing heavily so that they can compete.</p>
<p>The artificial intelligence and machine learning APIs often seem magical and mysterious as they operate in a black box, but the solutions they provide range from practical solutions like sentiment analysis and categorization of text, to image transformation, and object or facial recognition in photos. This is just a small subset of what is possible with artificial intelligence and machine learning, with many specialized solutions emerging for using in specific industries like agriculture, policing, or healthcare. APIs are being used to deliver artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions, by wrapping these algorithms in web technology, making them accessible for use in web, mobile, and device applications. In the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning, there is an often missed opportunity by API providers when it comes to augmenting and complementing artificial intelligence and machine learning APIs with other data and content APIs, allowing for much richer, meaningful, and contextually relevant responses.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/analysis.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Analysis &amp; Awareness</strong><br />Using APIs can deliver a heightened level of awareness of a company or organization's digital assets, opening them up in a variety of ways. By employing modern approaches to API management, where all API requests and responses are logged, and all applications and their users are identified, an entirely new level of analysis and surveillance is possible regarding how digital resources are being put to use, or possibly not put to use. Companies who are further along in their API journey have come to realize that in addition to have APIs valuable for business operations, it is valuable to also craft APIs on top of the API operations as well, adding an entirely new dimension to how APIs can be put to use across aa platform. This approach to API deployment has opened up entirely new business models, taking the innovation explored earlier to new levels, driving home the opportunity for serendipity to occur across operations.</p>
<p>This newfound awareness (sometimes turning to surveillance) across operations is the number one benefit of doing APIs. Going API-first helps map out digital resources while making them more accessible, and reusable, and when reporting is properly applied across the logging that is common across API operations, the analysis opportunities can be just as compelling as the core APIs themselves. Understanding how resources are used, what is of most interest to users, and what types of applications are making the biggest impact rise to the top. Because this layer is API driven as well, the same approach to integration, iteration and innovation can occur as other areas of the ecosystem. This layer API access should be carefully controlled, and may or may not be available to the public, and often only available internally, or to a select group of partners, making the analysis and awareness much more guarded, so that it protects the privacy and security of end-users, as well as platform operators and developers.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/visualization.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Visualizations &amp; Embeddable</strong><br />Whether it's directly from core API resources, or the operational level of APIs, building off the modular and portable approach available with modern API architecture, one of the most valuable applications within an ecosystem is centered around the ability to visualize, and deliver embedding solutions on the web, mobile, in emails, and other applications. A dashboard is a common way to look at this, or possibly API-riven infographics, but the savviest API providers are developing a wealth of API embeddable that leverage open source solutions such as D3.js to make everything visual and embeddable. When this approach accompanies a branding strategy, it can extend the value of the platform beyond the domain, extending the reach of the ecosystem. While often centered around more visual elements of the platform, embeddable tools can also be more functional and interactive, bringing another dimension of benefit to operations.</p>
<p>Embeddable tooling comes in all shapes and sizes, with the best solutions adhering to web standards, and leaving proprietary approaches behind the firewall. The most well-known examples of this in action can be found with Twitter and Facebook share buttons, or with the Youtube video player which extends the video platform on sites across the web. Embeddables do not have to be developed by the platform alone and can become a community effort, showcasing simple, copy and pastable solutions crafted by an APIs developer within the ecosystem. The first layer of API-driven embeddable should speak to the value delivered by core APIs, with the second layer of embeddable taking advantage of the programmable web, and making the experience more interactive for consumers, generating content, and data--bringing value to the platform that can contribute to the analysis and awareness layer of API operations discussed previously.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/bw-storytelling.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Evangelism &amp; Storytelling</strong><br />APIs begin with a technological seed but they need to make an impact at the human level if they are to find success, making the single most important tool in the toolbox storytelling, advocacy, and evangelism around what an API does. If people do not know an API exists, or what is possible with, none of this matters. API operations often suffer from the same search engine optimization (SEO) challenges that regular website efforts do. For an API to stand out and be found on the web it takes a great deal of work telling stories about API operations, and the applications that are being build on top of them. This storytelling needs to be included as part of existing marketing strategies, but will also require a special touch for it to pass the inspection of an often very picky developer community, who tend to be a slightly different beast when it comes to getting the attention of, and keep&nbsp;them engaged.</p>
<p>Storytelling and evangelism have to be genuine. It has to speak to the value an API brings to the table, and reflect the solutions that developers and integrators will be looking to provide. This outreach isn't just a public effort, it should include public consumers, as well as partners, and internal users. Ideally, API outreach has a dedicated team that can craft a message that speaks to the platform, but also respond to support operations, and be intimately aware of what is happening within the ecosystem, establishing and maintaining a deep relationship with the community. If outreach is going to be effective, it has to be relevant to the operations, match the technical and other support challenges that developers are facing--possessing strong context for the community. Finding a voice, establishing, and maintaining a true presence for an API is the number challenge I see API platform's struggle with, and is the number one contributor to their demise.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/google-ubicomp.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Establishing a Presence</strong><br />There are thousands of public APIs available on the web, a number that is only growing, so standing out takes a significant amount of work. 75% of the API providers I encounter suffer from the "build it and they will come" disease, and think developers will just find them, and understand the value an API delivers. This is why you see a handful of blog posts on many APIs, a couple months of Tweets, and then radio silence. The successful APIs out there have sustained operations, with robust storytelling, evangelism and outreach both on and offline. This goes for APIs that aren't 100% public too. If you want to reach partners, or even make internal groups aware across large, and often global organizations, evangelism is essential. Establishing a presence is not a one time thing, it take months, and years to do properly, and will require constant investment and maintenance.</p>
<p>The most efficient way to establish a presence is by being transparent and observable in everything you do. Adding new features to the road map? Publish them online, blog and tweet about them. Get the community involved. Ask for feedback, follow and retweet your users. Get to know them on the platforms and in the channels they already exist on. Be a regular presence, but not one that is always preaching and selling. Make sure you listen, study, and understand your target audience, and speak to what they'll need. Even when a developer does learn about an API there is no guarantees they will have an immediately pressing need and put it to use right away. A fine tuned API presence will ensure that potential consumers are aware that an API exists, and is constantly being reminded that it exists by blogging, Tweeting, storytelling, outreach, and engagement--when done properly developers will know where to go when they have a problem to solve.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/repeat.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Repeat, Repeat, Repeat</strong><br />I have been doing API Evangelist for seven years this summer. Success has been difficult. It has taken a regular drumbeat to stand out in the crowd. It has required some difficult decisions regarding who I partner with, and give access to my resources and brand so that I maintain my desired level of trust amongst my consumers. While I'm not evangelizing a single API, I am helping cultivate the awareness of a variety of APIs, as well as the best practices across these API operations--the process is the same for individual API providers. Often times I'm repeating what I have written before, and giving similar talks at conferences, meetups, and presentations like this. However, I am always iterating and evolving based on feedback I receive, and how my work is applied (or not), something that can be very painful to move forward on some days. The creativity doesn't always come right away, and sometimes I have to just to maintenance work just to keep busy, and come back to my storytelling when it feels right.</p>
<p>The most important part of what I'm doing is that I'm consistently out there, telling stories online, and in person. Early on in my presence, it was critical for me to be at public events shaking hands&nbsp;and making the in-person connections. After three years of doing a majority of in-person events I'm able to do more of it online, than I do offline, but I still have to be blogging, tweeting, and committing regularly. This is how I've established the presence that I have, and made the connection with people that I have. When someone is ready to do APIs or ready for the next step in their API operations, they know where to find me, and the resources that I provide. This is the core of any API operation, my world is no different than yours. I guarantee I have way less budget, and time than you, but somehow I've found a way to keep going. I have also had several times where I faced burnout, but I find if I just keep pushing forward, creating, writing, developing, and iterating I get through it--the solution is always repeat, repeat, and repeat&nbsp;until I find the right path forward.</p>

<p><em>While this talk was designed just for my conversation with the Oxford University Press team, it is generic enough for any other company to consider, and use to learn about the API space. I worked pretty hard to keep it a pretty positive view of the API landscape, and left most of the realities of this world for the in-person conversation, but is also something I'll cover in future posts this week. Honestly, when working with organizations like the Oxford University Press, I am left pretty optimistic about this whole API thing--something that is increasingly difficult with some of the ways that I am seeing APIs be wielded in 2017.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://guides.github.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/github_guides.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have had a number of requests from folks lately to write more about Github, and how they can use the social coding platform as part of their API operations. As I work with more companies outside of the startup echo chamber on their API strategies I am encountering more groups that aren't Github fluent&nbsp;and could use some help getting started. It has also been a while since I've thought deeply about how API providers should be using Github&nbsp;so it will allow me to craft some fresh content on the subject.</p>
<p><strong>Github As Your Technical Social Network</strong><br />Think of Github as a more technical version of Facebook, but instead of the social interactions being centered around wall posts, news links, photos, and videos, it is focused on engagement with repositories. A repository is basically a file folder that you can make public or private, and put anything you want into it. While code is the most common thing put into Github repositories, they often contain data file, presentations, and other content, providing a beneficial way to manage many aspects of API operations.</p>
<p><strong>The Github Basics</strong><br />When putting Github to use as part of your API operations, start small. Get your profile setup, define your organization, and begin using it to manage documentation or other simple areas of your operations--until you get the hang of it. Set aside any pre-conceived notions about Github being about code, and focus on the handful of services it offers to enable your API operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Users </strong>- Just like other online services, Github has the notion of a user, where you provide a photo, description, and other relevant details about yourself. Avoid making a user accounts for your API, making sure you show the humans involved in API operations. It does make sense to have a testing, or other generic platform Github users accounts, but make sure your API team each have their own user profile, providing a snapshot of everyone involved. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Organizations -</strong> You can use Github organizations to group your API operations under a single umbrella. Each organization has a name, logo, and description, and then you can add specific users as collaborators, and build your team under a single organization. Start with a single repository for your entire API operations, then you can consider the additional organization to further organize your efforts such as partner programs, or other aspects of internal API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Repositories -</strong> A repository is just a folder. You can create a repository, and replicate (check out) a repository using the Github desktop client, and manage its content locally, and commit changes back to Github whenever you are ready. Repositories are designed for collaborative, version controlled engagements, allowing for many people to work together, while still providing centralized governance and control by the designated gatekeeper for whatever project being managed via a repository--the most common usage is for managing open source software.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/blog/2309-introducing-topics">Topics</a> -</strong> Recently Github added the ability to label your repositories using what they call topics. Topics are used as part of Github discovery, allowing users to search using common topics, as well as searching for users, organizations, and repositories by keyword. Github Topics is providing another way for developers to find interesting APIs using search, browsing, and <a href="https://github.com/trending">Github trends</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gists</a></strong> - A GitHub service for managing code snippets that allow them to be embedded in other websites, documentation -- great for use in blog posts, and communication around API operations.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Pages</a></strong> - Use Github Pages for your project websites. It is the quickest way to stand up a web page to host API documentation, code samples, or the entire portal for your API effort.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">API</a> - </strong>Everything on the Github platform is available through the Github API. Making all aspects of your API operations available via an API, which is the way it should be.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Managing API Operations With Github</strong><br />There are a handful of ways I encourage API providers to consider using Github as part of their operations. I prefer to use Github for all aspects of API operations, but not every organization is ready for that--I encourage you to focus in these areas when you are just getting going:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Developer Portal -</strong> You can use Github Pages to host your API developer portal--I recommend taking a look at <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">my minimum viable API portal definition</a> to see an example of this in action.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Whether as part of the entire portal or just as a single repository, it is common for API providers to publish API documentation to Github. <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc">Using solutions like ReDoc</a>, it is easy to make your API documentation look good, while also easily keeping them up to date.</li>
<li><strong>Code Samples w/ </strong>Gists<strong>&nbsp;-</strong> It is easy to manage all samples for an API using Github Gists, allowing them to be embedded in the documentation, and other communication and storytelling conducted as part of platform operations.</li>
<li><strong>Software Development Kits (SDK) Repositories -</strong> If you are providing complete SDKs for API integrations in a variety of languages you should be using Github to manage their existence, allowing API consumers to fork and integrate as they need, while also staying in tune with changes.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAPI Management </strong>- Publish your <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> or <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> definition to Github, allowing the YAML or JSON to be versioned, and managed in a collaborate environment where API consumers can fork and integrate into their own operations.</li>
<li><strong>Issues</strong> - Use <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">Github issues</a> for managing the conversation around integration and operational issues.</li>
<li><strong>Road Map</strong> - Also use <strong>Github Issues</strong> to help aggregate, collaborate, and evolve the road map for API operations, encouraging consumers to be involved.</li>
<li><strong>Change Log</strong> - When anything on the roadmap is achieved flag it for inclusion in the change log, providing a list of changes to the platform that API consumers can use as a reference.</li>
</ul>
<p>Github is essential to API operations. There is no requirement for Github users to possess developer skills. Many types of users put Github to use in managing the technical aspects of projects&nbsp;to take advantage of the network effect, as well as the version control and collaboration introduced by the social platform. It's common for non-technical folks to be intimidated by Github, ad developers often encourage this, but in reality, Github is as easy to use as any other social network--it just takes some&nbsp;time to get used to and familiar it.</p>
<p>If you have questions about how to use Github, feel free to reach out. I'm happy to focus on specific uses of Github for API operations in more detail. I have numerous examples of how it can be used, I just need to know where I should be focusing next. Remember, there are no stupid questions. I am an advocate for everyone taking advantage of Github&nbsp;and I fully understand that it can be difficult to understand how it works when you are just getting going.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm keeping an eye on the different approaches by API service providers when it comes to providing API editors within their services and tooling. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/06/please-develop-an-embeddable-open-source-visual-api-editor/">While I wish there was an open source GUI API editor out there</a>, the closest thing we have is from these API service providers, and I am trying to track on what the best practices are so that when someone does step up and begin working on an open, embeddable solution, they can learn from my stories about what is working or not working across the space.</p>
<p>One example I think has characteristics that should be emulated is <a href="https://scenarios.stoplight.io/spec-editor">the API Spec Editor from Stoplight</a>. The GUI editor lets you manage all the core elements of an OpenAPI like the general info, host, paths, and even the shared responses and parameters. They even provide what they call a CRUD builder where you paste the JSON schema, and they'll generate the common paths you will need to create, read, update, and delete your resources. Along the way you can also make calls to API endpoints using their interactive interface, helping ensure your API definition is actually in alignment with your API.</p>
<p>The Stoplight API Spec Editor bridges the process of defining your OpenAPI for your operations, with actually documenting and engaging with an API through an interactive client interface. I like this approach to coming at API design from multiple directions. Apiary first taught us that API definitions were about more than just documentation, and I think our API editors should keeping evolving on this concept, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/29/helping-your-customers-operate-throughout-the-api-life-cycle/">allowing us to engage with any stops along the API life cycle&nbsp;like we are seeing from API service providers like Restlet</a>.</p>
<p>I'm already keeping an eye on Restlet and APIMATIC's approach to providing a GUI API design editor within their solutions&nbsp;and will keep an eye out on other providers as I have time. Like other areas of the API sector, I'm hoping I can develop a list of best practices that any service provider can follow when developing their tools and services.</p>

<p>I'm endlessly fascinated by APIs&nbsp;and enjoy studying their evolution. One of the challenges in helping evangelize APIs that I come across regularly is the many different views of what is or isn't an API amongst people who are API literate, as well as helping bring APIs into focus for the API newcomers&nbsp;because there are so many possibilities. Out of the two, I'd say that dealing with API dogma is by far a bigger challenge, than explaining APIs to newbies--dogma can be very poisonous to productive conversations and end up working against everyone involved in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm enjoying reading about the evolution in the API space when it comes to GraphQL and gRPC. There are a number of very interesting implementations, services, tooling, and implementations emerging in both these areas. However, I do see similar mistakes being made regarding dogmatic behavior, aggressive marketing tactics, and shaming folks for doing things differently, as I've seen with REST, Hypermedia, and linked data efforts. I know folks are passionate about what they are doing, and truly believe their way is right, but I'm concerned you will all suffer from the same deficiencies&nbsp;in adoption I've seen with previous implementations.</p>
<p>I started API Evangelist with the mission of counteracting the aggressive approach of the RESTafarians. I've spent a great deal of time thinking about how I can turn average developers and even business folks on to the concept of APIs--no not just REST or just hypermedia, but web APIs in general. Something that I now feel includes GraphQL and gRPC. I've seen many hardworking folks invest a lot into their APIs, only to have them torn apart by API techbros (TM) who think they've done it wrong--not giving a rats ass regarding the need to actually help someone understand the pros and cons of each approach.</p>
<p>I'm confident that GraphQL will find its place&nbsp;in the API toolbox, and enjoy significant adoption when it comes to data-intensive&nbsp;API implementations. However, I'd say 75% of the posts I read are pitting GraphQL against REST, stating it is a better solution. Period. No mention of its limitations or use cases where it might not be a good idea. Leaving us to only find out about these from the GraphQL haters--playing out the exact same production we've seen over the last five years with REST v Hypermedia. Hypermedia is finding its place in some very useful API implementations like FoxyCart, and AWS API Gateway (to name just a few), but its growth has definitely suffered from this type of storytelling, and I fear that GraphQL will face a similar fate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem is not a technical challenge. It is a storytelling and communication&nbsp;challenge, bundled with some very narrow incentive models fueled by a male-dominated startup culture, where folks really, really like being right and making others feel bad for not being right. Stop it. You aren't helping your cause. Even if you do get all your techbros thinking like you do, your tactics will fail in the mainstream business world, and you will only give more ammo to your haters, and further confuse your would be consumers, adopters, and practitioners. You will have a lot more success if you are empathetic towards your readers, and produce content that educates, and empowers, over shames and tearing down.</p>
<p>I'm writing this because I want my readers to understand the benefits of GraphQL, and I don't want gRPC evangelists to make the same mistake. It has taken waaaay too long for linked data efforts to recover, and before you say it isn't a thing, it has made a significant comeback in SEO circles, because of Google's adoption of JSON-LD, and a handful of SEO evangelists spreading the gospel in a friendly and accessible way--not because of linked data people (they tend to be dicks in my experience). As I've said before, we should be investing in a robust API toolbox, and we should be helping people understand that benefits of different approaches, and learn about the successful implementations. Please learn from others mistakes in the sector, and help see meaningful growth across all viable approaches to doing API--thanks.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Mar 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_30_at_6.48.27_pm.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="https://blog.runscope.com/posts/using-google-sheets-and-runscope-to-run-api-tests-with-multiple-variable-sets">The Runscope team recently published a post on a pretty cool approach to using Google Sheets for running API tests with multiple variable sets</a>, which I thought is valuable at a couple of levels. They provide <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B8iTvriTfCbvUIe0mvc7dbNInYanaQn_00LvWHVZn8E/edit#gid=0">a template Google Sheet for anyone to follow, where you can plug in your variable, as well as your Runscope API Key, which allows you to define the dimensions of the tests you wish to push to Runscope via their own API.</a></p>
<p>The first thing that grabs me about this approach is how Runscope is allowing their customers to define and expand the dimensions of how they test their API using Runscope in a way that will speak to a wider audience, beyond just the usual API developer audience. Doing this in a spreadsheet allows Runscope customers to customize their API tests for exactly the scenarios they need, without Runscope having to customize and respond to each individual customer's needs--providing a nice balance.</p>
<p>The second thing that interests me about their approach is the usage of a Googe Sheet as a template for making API calls, whether you are testing your APIs, or any other scenario an API enables. This type of templating of API calls opens up the API client to a much wider audience, making integration copy and pastable, shareable, collaborative, and something anyone can reverse engineer and learn about the surface area of an API--in this scenario, it just happens to be the surface area of Runscope's API testing API.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/23/sharing-api-data-validation-examples/">Runscope's approach is alignment with my previous post about sharing data validation examples</a>. A set of assertions could be defined within a spreadsheets and any stakeholder could use the spreadsheet to execute and make sure the assertions are met. This would have huge implications for the average business user to help make sure API contracts are meeting business objectives. I'm considering using this approach to empower cities, counties, and states to test and validate human services API implementations as part of my <a href="http://openreferral.org">Open Referral</a> work.</p>
<p>It told John Sheehan, the CEO of Runscope that their approach was pretty creative, and he said that "Google sheets scripts are underrated" and that Google Sheets is the "API client for the everyperson". I agree. I'd like to see more spreadsheet templates like this used across the API life cycle when it comes to design, deployment, management, testing, monitoring, and every other area of API operations. I'd also like to see more spreadsheet templates available for making calls to other common APIs, making APIs accessible to a much wider audience, who are familiar with spreadsheets, and more likely to be closer to the actual problems in which API solutions are designed to solve.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_30_at_3.12.32_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Many API providers I meet have the "build it and they will come" mentality, thinking that if they build an API, developers will come and use it. It does happen, but many APIs only have so many direct uses, and will have a limited number of resulting implementations. This is one of the reasons I recommend companies do APIs in the first place, to get beyond the obvious and direct implementations, and incentivize entirely new applications that a provider may not have considered.</p>
<p>Developing innovative applications an API provider may not have considered is the primary focus of companies I talk to, but only a handful have begun thinking about the other APIs that are out there that might compliment an API. An example of this is with my friends over at the <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/">Oxford Dictionary APIs</a>, where building applicaitons with built-in dictionaries is pretty obvious. However, the complimentary API partnering and usage might not be as obvious, something I'm encouraging their team to think more about.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/">What are some examples of complimentary APIs for the Oxford Dictionaries API</a>?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Design - </strong>This example is more meta API, than complimentary API, but <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/29/learning-to-use-our-words-better-when-defining-our-apis/">I'd like to see more API design tooling to begin to use dictionaries as part of their GUI and IDE interfaces</a>. Providing more structure to the way we design our APIs, helping ensure that the design of leading APIs are more intuitive, and coherent--achieving a less technical interface, and something that speaks to humans.</li>
<li><strong>Machine Learning -</strong> I'm using a number of machine learning APIs to accomplish a variety of business tasks from object recognition in images, to text and language pattern recognition in content I produce or curate. There are a number of opportunities to extend the responses I get back from these APIs using a dictionary, helping increase the reach of the machine learning services I employ, and making them more effective and meaningful in my business operations.</li>
<li><strong>Search -</strong> I use the <a href="https://www.algolia.com/doc/rest-api/search/">Algolia API</a> to build a variety of search indexes for the API space, helping me curate and recall a variety of information that I track on as part of my API monitoring. I'm considering building a augmented synonym layer tha thelps me search for terms, then expand those searches based upon suggestions from the Oxford Dictionaries API. I'm looking to augment and enrich the Algolia search capabilities with the suggestions from the dictionary API, expanding beyond any single key word or phrase I identify relevant to any industry or topic being served by the API sector.</li>
<li><strong>Bots</strong> - If you are going to build convincing bots using the Slack or Facebook APIs you will need a robust vocabulary to work with. You won't just need a single downloaded and stored dictionary, you will need one like the Oxford Dictionaries API that evolves and changes with the world around us to enrich your bot's presence.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Voice</strong> - Similar to bots, if you are going to deliver a robust voice interface via Alexa, or other voice enabled platform, you will need a rich dictionary to work from. Similar to how I'm expanding and enriching the other suggestions listed above, a dictionary layer will expand on how you will be able to interpret the text that is derived from each voice interface engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a couple examples of how one API could provide complimentary features to other APIs out there. It is important for API providers to be reaching out to other API providers and their communities when evangelizing their own APIs. Sure, you should be incentivizing developers to build applications on top of your APIs, but your definition of "application" should include other APIs that your resources compliment, and enrich the solutions being developed on top their platforms.</p>
<p>For a space where integration and interoperability appears to be priority number one, the API sector is notoriously closed, and many API providers I meet have their blinders on. As an API provider you should always be studying the rest of the API sector, looking for good examples to follow, as well as bad examples to avoid--similar to what I do as the API Evangelist. Along this journey you should also be looking for complimentary APIs to your platform, and vice versa. Think of SendGrid and Twilio as an example--email, SMS, and voice all go together very well, and their communities significantly overlap, providing the makings for a ripe partnership.</p>
<p>What are a couple of existing APIs that your APIs complement? This is your homework assignment for the week! ;-)</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/why-bots-should-use-buttons-5f729df17c0#.36uy7bsvd">Slack released their Slack Buttons last year</a>, to help as they state "reduce the number of small yet high-frequency tasks that quietly devour a user&rsquo;s time." I know folks are obsessed with <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com">voice</a>, <a href="http://bot.apievangelist.com">bot</a>, and other conversational interfaces, but I agree with Slack, that there is a huge opportunity to help users execute common API-driven functions with a single push of a button. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/26/asynchonous-conversational-interfaces-for-us-anti-social-folks/">It is something I blog about regularly</a>, helping folks realize the opportunity in the development of API driven, embeddable buttons, that go beyond what Slack is doing and would run anywhere on the web, in the browser, or even on mobile and other Internet connected devices.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/11/ipaas-in-your-browser-with-push-by-zapier/">Zapier has taken a stab at this with Push by Zapier</a>, and they have the inventory of APIs to support it. However, what I am thinking about should be even easier, embeddable anywhere, and leverage the web technology already in use (forms, inputs, GET, POST, etc.). If in a browser it should work like bookmarklets, and if it exists within the pages of a website or application, it should work as some simple copy/paste HTML with minimum JS when necessary to avoid blockage by ad blockers and other privacy protection tooling.</p>
<p>I understand that it is easy to follow the pack when it comes to the latest technology trends, and I'm sure voice and bots will gain some mindshare when it comes to conversational interfaces. However, sometimes we just need the easy button for those high-frequency tasks that quietly devour our time, as Slack puts it. As I <a href="https://developers.google.com/schemas/formats/json-ld">see JSON-LD embedeed into more web pages</a>, further pleasing the Google search algorithm, there would also be more semantic opportunities for browser buttons to engage with the data and content within web pages in a more meaningful, and context aware way.</p>
<p>API driven buttons and similiar <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">embeddables</a> and browser tooling is such an interesting opportunity that I would tackle myself, but I'm so resistant to anything that might take me away from my work as the API Evangelist, which is why I'm putting it out here publicly. I will put more time into some single use button examples that might start the conversation for some, but I recommend taking a look at what Slack and Zapier have done to get started. As the pace of technology continues it's blind march forward at the request of VCs, I'm confident that there is huge opportunity for simple solutions like buttons to make a significant impact--let me know if you'd like to know more.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com">I am playing around with the Open API for the Oxford Dictionaries API</a>, and I'm struck by the importance of not just dictionaries like the Oxford Dictionaries, but also the importance of OpenAPI, and API providers defining their APIs like the Oxford folks have. While we aren't as far down the road as we are with the English dictionary, we are beginning to make progress when it comes to defining the paths, parameters, and other characteristics using OpenAPI, learning to speak and communicate in the digital world using APIs.</p>
<p>We use words to craft titles, paragraphs, outlines, and other ways that we communicatie in our personal and professional lives. We also use words to craft titles, paragraphs, outlines, collections, and other ways our systems our communicating in our personal and professional lives using the OpenAPI specification. In both these forms of communicating we are always trying to find just the right words, or series and orders of words to get across exactly the meaning we are looking for--we just have centuries of doing this when it comes writing and speaking, and only a decade or so of doing this with defining our digital resources using APIs.</p>
<p>Eventually, I'd like to see entire dictionaries of <a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>, <a href="http://alps.io/">ALPS</a>, or other machine readable specification, available by industry, and topic. The way we craft our API definitions and design our APIs often feels like we have barely learned to speak, let alone read or write. I'd like to see more reuse of common dictionaries already in use by leading API providers, and I'd like to see us get more thoughtful in how we express ourselves via our API definitions.  The most successful APIs I find out there don't just provide a machine readable interface, they provide an intuitive interface that makes sense to humans, while also being machine readable for use in other systems.</p>
<p>It feels like to me that we should integrating the <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/">Oxford Dictionaries API</a> into our API design tooling, letting us suggest, autocomplete, and discover better ways to articulate the meaning behind our APIs. <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools/design-editors/">API design editors</a> could use the Oxford Dictionaries API to help developers attach more precise meaning to the names of paths, parameters, and other aspects of defining our APIs, much like word processors have done for the last couple of decades. Most APIs I come across do not have any sort of coherent name, ordering, or structure, and the few that have deployed an OpenAPI or other machine readable format, often feel like cave writing, and lack any coherent structure, purpose, or meaning--we have a long, long way to go before our systems learn to communicate even at a 1st grade level.</p>

<p>When I started API Evangelist back in 2010 the only stop along the API life cycle that service providers were talking about was API management. In 2017, there are numerous stops along the API life cycle from design, to testing, all the way to deprecation. The leading API providers are expanding the number of stops they service, and the smart ones are making sure that if they only service on or two stops, they do so by providing via API definitions like OpenAPI, ensuring their customers are able to seamlessly weave multiple service providers together to address their full life cycle of needs.</p>

When I first was introduced to Restlet they were the original open source enterprise grade API deployment framework. Then Restlet became a cloud API deployment and management provider, and with their acquisition of DHC they also became an API client, and testing provider. Now with their latest update, they have worked hard to help their developer and business customers service almost every stop along a modern API life cycle, from design to deprecation.</p>
<p>While Restlet is developing tooling to help companies define what the API life cycle means to them, the heartbeat of what Restlet delivers centers around API definitions like OpenAPI and RAML. API definitions provide the framework when your designing, deploying, documenting, managing, and testing your APIs using Restlet. They also provide the ability for you to get your API definitions in and out of the platform, and load them into potentially other API services, allow API operators to get what they need done. In my opinion, making API definitions just as importan tas any other service or tooling you offer along the API life cycle.</p>
<p>Serving a single or handful of stops along the API life cycle can be today's version of vendor lockin. If your customers cannot easily load their API definitions in and out of your system you are locking them in, and while they may stay with you for a while, eventually they will need additional services, and the extra work it takes to keep in sync with your platform will increase, and eventually it won't be worth staying. I'm a big fan of companies doing one thing and doing it well, servicing single stops along the API life cycle, but after watching companies come and go for the last seven years, the one's that don't support API definitions won't be around too long.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/glitch_fishes.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was playing around with, and better understanding <a href="https://glitch.com/">the new collaborative developer community that is Glitch</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/glitch/how-we-wont-screw-up-glitch-9b46fe153157">I saw they had published a blog post about how they won't screw up Glitch</a>. The topic was in alignment with another post I was working on regarding what I'd like to see fro API startups, but I think Anil articulates it better than even I could, and I think folks are going to respect it a lot more when it comes from a seasoned veteran like him, over an opinionated evangelist like me.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/glitch/how-we-wont-screw-up-glitch-9b46fe153157">In hist post, Anil shares five key points I think every startup should be thinking about from day one</a>:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="315c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong><span class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">No lock-in.&nbsp;</span></strong>We use totally standard infrastructure for Glitch, including regular old Node.js, and normal JavaScript for your code. You can export all of your code to GitHub with a click, or download a zip file of your code instantly at any time. And it&rsquo;s gonna stay that way. The key thing that we think will keep you using Glitch is by your deep emotional connection to your fellow members of the community. And that&rsquo;s not lock-in, that&rsquo;s love! Aww.</li>
<li id="c432" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong><span class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">We&rsquo;re not gonna take features away from you and then start charging for them</span>.</strong> This is one of those tricky things that a lot of companies do when they start building a business model for their product &mdash; they ask, &ldquo;what would people pay for?&rdquo; And then they realize&hellip; oh crap, the stuff people want to pay for is already offered for free. We&rsquo;ve thought about this pretty carefully so we&rsquo;ll be able to support our current features going forward. (It doesn&rsquo;t cost much for us to run your Glitch app, and that cost is going down each month. No biggie.)</li>
<li id="50ed" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span class="markup--strong markup--li-strong"><strong>When we do start charging for stuff, we&rsquo;ll check with you first</strong>.&nbsp;</span>We imagine we&rsquo;ll add some paid features on top of what Glitch has now (maybe domain names?&nbsp;<span class="markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other">Everybody loves mapping domain names!)</span>&nbsp;and when we do, we&rsquo;ll let you know they&rsquo;re coming, plus get your feedback on what you think is fair and reasonable pricing. Because we want you to be happy to pay for these valuable features!</li>
<li id="a1df" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong><span class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">We won&rsquo;t let a bunch of jerks take over the community.&nbsp;</span></strong>Ugh, this one is so annoying. Usually, when a company is trying to grow a community, they&rsquo;ll let just about anybody in because they&rsquo;re desperate to show growth, and that inevitably means opening the door to some small number of jerks, who then ruin the whole site for everybody. Instead of doing that foolish thing, we&rsquo;re going to grow Glitch steadily and deliberately, with tons of room for new folks, but a lot of thought put into preventing abuse and harassment. I can&rsquo;t guarantee we&rsquo;ll get it perfect, but honestly the thought of working every day to build something that&rsquo;s mostly used by jerks would be awful, so we&rsquo;re not gonna do it. And honestly, Glitch is growing pretty quickly because it&rsquo;s friendly, so hooray for nice people.</li>
<li id="acd1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong><span class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">We want your fun and weird and &ldquo;not serious&rdquo; stuff on Glitch, too.&nbsp;</span></strong>While we&rsquo;re ecstatic to feature Serious Tools from incredible companies like Slack on Glitch, we think your artsy or silly or deeply personal projects are vital to the community, too. The same people who spend their day building a complex API integration on top of Glitch&rsquo;s tools will come home and collaborate on a generative poetry project at night, and that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re designing for. So don&rsquo;t feel embarrassed to show all your many facets here; that&rsquo;s what our own team does, too.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other things I'd like to see other startups focus on like privacy and security, but Anil really get's at athe heart of much of the illness we see regarding API startups. For me, it really comes down to communication and honesty about the business model, which Anil talks about in a very approachable way. I don't expect companies who are doing startups to do everything that us developers want, but I do want you to be open, honest, and communicative with us about what is going on--that is all.</p>
<p>I fully grasp that startups are in the business of making money, and often have different motivations than many (some) of us developers who are consuming their API focused resources. I do not expect these things to always be in perfect balance, but I do expect startups to be honest with developers from day one, and not bullshit us about their business model, changes and the long term road map. I appreciate that Anil and the Glitch team has started things off on this foot, hopefully providing the rest of us with a model to follow when it comes to not screwing over your developer community, and building more trust when it comes to depending on APIs across the sector.</p>
<p>I am looking forwarding to <a href="https://glitch.com/">learning more about Glitch</a>, and the potential for the community.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Mar 2017</span>
        <p>Building a business is hard. Building a business that depends on other business is hard. We would like it if all of our vendors stuck around forever, but this is not the reality of doing business in today's climate. My stance on this situation that nothing lasts forever, but startups and the enterprise could be more honest about the business of startups, which is seriously beginning to impact the trust we all have in the platforms, tools, and APIs we depend on for our businesses.</p>
<p>I was working my way through some legacy tweets, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ParseIt">I came across Parse's Twitter home page</a>, which I think sums up the promise being made by each wave of startups, and the end results of these promises--although I have to say that Parse actually handled it pretty well, compared with other startups that I have seen in action.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/parse_building_apps_isnt_easy_shut_down.png" alt="" width="95%" /></p>
<p>Building apps is not easy. However, we need solutions that will get us all the way there. I actually think that in the end, Parse handled it pretty well, better than StackMob did, when Paypal bought them. In the end, you could take the open source version of Parse and install it, and they communicated the deprecation pretty well, giving folks quite a bit of time to take care of business. However, this is the way it should be from day one. There should be APIs, and open source available to ease operation and migration--as well as communication about what the future will hold.</p>
<p>If API focused startups don't start being more honest about their true business strategy, and the realities of the future from day one, fewer developers and users will buy what is being sold. Sure, there will always be new waves of young developers who will still believe, but the more experienced folks, who are often in charge of making purchasing decisions, will become increasingly skeptical about baking in APIs into their operations--screwing this up for the rest of us trying to actually make a living, and not just get rich.</p>

<p>There are a number of things at work making this whole web API thing actually work. One of them that came up while I was at Google discussing APIs a couple weeks ago, while we were listening to Dan Ciruli (<a href="https://twitter.com/danciruli">@danciruli</a>) was the importance of being able to see an API request in the browser. It is something I think we often overlook when it comes to understanding why web APIs have reached such a wide audience.</p>
<p>I remember when I first realized I could change the URL in my Delicious account and get an XML listing of my bookmarks--this is when the API light first went on in my head. The web wasn't just for humans, it could be structured for use in other websites. Seeing the XML in the browser presented me links in a machine readable way, that triggered me to think about else I could with them, and which other systems I could put them to work in.</p>
<p>Being able to see the results of an API call in the browser helps stimulate the imagination when it comes to what is possible. This is similar to why API client tooling like <a href="http://getpostman.com/">Postman</a> and <a href="https://client.restlet.com/">Restlet Client</a> are popular with developers--they help us see the possibilities. While not all APIs are simple enough to allow for viewing in the browser, when at all possible, we should keep things this easy, because you never know when it will make a mark, and help folks better understand what is going on under the hood, allowing them to put our APIs to work in ways we never expected.</p>

<p class="p1"><em>This is an article from the current edition of the&nbsp;<a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">API Evangelist industry guide to API definitions</a>. The guide is designed to be a summary of the world of API definitions, providing the reader with a recent summary of the variety of specifications that are defining the technology behind almost every part of our digital world</em></p>
<p class="p1">OpenAPI Spec is currently the most used API definition format out there, with the number of implementations, and tooling, with API Blueprint, Postman Collections, and other formats trailing behind. It can make sense to support a single API definition when it comes to an individual platforms operations, but when it comes to interoperability with other systems it is important to be multi-lingual and support multiple of the top machine-readable formats out there today.</p>
<p class="p1">In my monitoring of the API sector, one service provider has stood out when it comes to being a truly multi-lingual API definition service provider--the SDK generation provider, APIMATIC. The company made API definitions the heart of its operations, generating what they call development experience (DX) kits, from a central API definition uploaded by users--supporting OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, Postman Collections, and other top formats. The approach has allowed the company to quickly expand into new areas like documentation, testing, continuous integration, as well as opening up their API definition translation as a separate service called <a href="https://apimatic.io/transformer">API Transformer</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://apimatic.io/transformer">API Transformer</a> allows anyone to input an API Blueprint, Swagger, WADL, WSDL, Google Discovery, RAML 0.8 - 1.0, I/O Docs - Mashery, HAR 1.2, Postman Collection 1.0 - 2.0, Mashape, or APIMATIC Format API definition and then translate and export in a&nbsp; API Blueprint, Swagger 1.0 - 1.2, Swagger 2.0 JSON, Swagger 2.0 YAML, WADL - W3C 2009, RAML 0.8 - 1.0, Postman Collection 1.0 - 2.0, and their own APIMATIC Format. You can execute API definition translations through their interface or seamlessly integrate with the API Transformer API definition conversation API.</p>
<p class="p1">There is no reason that an API provider and API service providers shouldn&rsquo;t be multi-lingual. It is fine to adopt a single API definition as part of your own API operations, but when it comes to working with external groups, there is no excuse for not being able to work with any of the top API definition formats. The translation of API definitions will increasingly be essential to doing business throughout the API life cycle, requiring each company to have an API definition translation engine baked into their continuous integration workflow, transforming how they do business and build software.</p>

<p>I was roaming <a href="https://cloud.google.com/prediction/docs/reference/v1.6/">through Google's Prediction </a><a href="https://cloud.google.com/prediction/docs/reference/v1.6/">API</a>, and I thought <a href="https://cloud.google.com/prediction/docs/gallery">their prediction gallery provides us a look at a shift occurring right now in how we deliver APIs.</a>&nbsp;I predict that machine learning galleries and marketplaces will&nbsp;become all the rage, independently operating like <a href="https://algorithmia.com/">Algorithmia</a>, or part of a specific API like the Google prediction gallery.</p>
<p>Ok, let me put it out there that I hate the use of word prediction. If I was naming the service, I would have called it "execution", or more precisely a "machine training (MT) model execution API". I know I'll never get my way, but I have to put it out there how bullshit many of the terms we use in the space are--ok, back to the API blah blah blah, as my daughter would say.</p>
<p>A common element of API portals for the last decade has included an application gallery, showcasing the apps that are developed on top of an API. Now, when an API offers up machine learning (training) (ML) execution capabilities, either generally or very specialized model execution (ie, genomics, financial), there should also be a gallery of available mobiles, or simply models that have been delivered as part of platform operations--just like we have done with APIs &amp; applications.</p>
<p>I see this stuff as the evolution of the algorithmic layer of API operations. Meaning that most APIs are delivering data or content, but there is a 3rd layer that is about wrapping algorithms, and in the current machine learning and artificial intelligence craze, this approach to delivering algorithmic APIs will continue to be popular. It's not an ML revolution, it is simply an evolution in how we are delivering API resources, leveraging ML models as the core wrapper (Google was smart for open sourcing TensorFlow).</p>
<p>Developing ML models, and making them deployable via AWS, Google, Azure, as well as marketplaces like Algorithmia will become a common approach for the API providers who are further along in their API journey, and have their resources well-defined, modular, and easily deployed in a retail or wholesale manner. While 90% of the ML implementations we will see in 2017 will be smoke and mirrors, 10% will deliver some interesting value that can be used across a growing number of industries--keeping machine training (MT), and machine training execution APIs like Google Prediction something I will be paying attention to. ;-)</p>

<p class="p1"><a href="https://federation.data.gov/">The U.S. Data Federation</a> is a federal government effort to facilitate data interoperability and harmonization across federal, state, and local government agencies by highlighting common data formats, API specifications, and metadata vocabularies. The project is focusing on being a coordinating interoperability across government agencies by showcasing and supporting use cases that demonstrate unified and coherent data architectures across disparate agencies, institutions, and organizations.</p>
<p class="p1">The project is designed to shine a light on &ldquo;emerging data standards and API initiatives across all levels of government, convey the level of maturity for each effort, and facilitate greater participation by government agencies&rdquo;--definitely in alignment with the goal of this guide. There are currently seven projects profiled as part of the U.S. Data Federation, including Building &amp; Land Development Specification, National Information Exchange Model, Open Referral, Open311, Project Open Data, Schema.org, and the Voting Information Project.</p>
<p class="p1">By providing a single location for agencies to find common schema documentation tools, schema validation tools, and automated data aggregation and normalization capabilities, the project is hoping to incentivize and stimulate reusability and interoperability across public data and API implementations. Government agencies of all shapes and sizes can use the common blueprints available in the U.S. Data Federation to reduce costs, speed up the implementation of projects, while also opening them up for augmenting and extending using their APIs, and common schema.</p>
<p class="p1">It is unclear what resources the U.S. Data Federation will have available in the current administration, but it looks like the project is just getting going, and intends to add more specifications as they are identified. The model reflects an approach that should be federated and evangelized at all levels of government, but also provides a blueprint that could be applied in other sectors like healthcare, education, and beyond. Aggregating common data formats, API specifications, metadata vocabularies, and authentication scopes will prove to be critical to the success of the overall climate of almost any industry doing business on the web in 2017.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/15/a-tighter-api-contract-with-grpc/">I wrote about how gRPC API implements deliver a tighter&nbsp;API contract</a>, but I wanted to also explore more thought from that same conversation, about how hypermedia APIs can help deliver a more evolvable API contract. The conversation where these thoughts were born was focused on the differences between REST and gRPC, in which hypermedia and GraphQL also came up. Leaving me thinking about how our API design and deployment decisions can impact the API contract we are putting forth to our consumers.</p>
<p>In contrast to gRPC, going with a hypermedia design for your API, your client relationship can change and evolve, providing an environment for things to flex and change. Some APIs, especially internal API, and trusted partners might be better suited for gRPC performance, but when you need&nbsp;to manage volatility and change across a distributed client base, hypermedia might be a better approach. I'm not advocating one over the other, I am just trying to understand the different types of API contracts brought to the table with each approach, so I can better articulate in my storytelling.</p>
<p>I'd say that hypermedia and gRPC approaches give API providers a different type of control over API clients that are consuming resources. gRPC enables dictating a high performance tighter coupling by generating clients, and hypermedia allows for shifts in what resources are available, what schema are being applied, and changes that might occur with each version, potentially without changes to the client. The API contract can evolve (within logical boundaries), without autogeneration of clients, and interference at this level.</p>
<p>As I learn about this stuff&nbsp;and consider the API contract implications, I feel like hypermedia helps API provides navigation change, evolve and shift to deliver resources to a more unknown, and distributed client base. gRPC seems like it provides a better contract for use in your known, trusted, and higher performance environments. Next, I will be diving into what API discovery looks like in a gRPC world, and coming back to this comparison with hypermedia, and delivering a contract.&nbsp;I am feeling like API discovery is another area that hypermedia will make sense, further helping API providers and API consumers conduct business in a fast changing environment.</p>

<p><span>The first dimension of the Uber Driver API I find interesting is that it is not an API that is about their core business--ridesharing. It is focused on making their drivers more successful, and developing tools, and integrations that make their lives easier. I could see something like this evolving to other platforms like AirBnB, and other sharing or gig economy platforms, helping operators make sense of their worlds, while also strengthening partnerships and hopefully their relationship with operators along the way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The second dimension I find interesting is thinking about why Uber is publishing their Driver API. At first glance it is all about making their drivers happy--something Uber needs a lot of help with currently. However, once you think a little more about it, you can start to see a bigger picture that Uber is looking to paint of their drivers. The company's leverage over drivers has proven to only go so far, and they need to understand more about the lives of their drivers, and if they can invite corporate partners to do their taxes, and potentially other key tasks in their lives, a greater picture of their&nbsp;life will come into focus.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If an Uber driver is also a Lyft driver, the Uber Driver API gives them more of a look into their competitor's accounting. They also get a better understanding of what else their drivers have going on, and other ways they can increase their leverage over them. It's fascinating to think about. Right now, all the examples Uber providers are tax related, but I'm sure other types of partners will emerge--it is why you do APIs. Open up an API, and people will line up innovate for you, helping you understand the dimensions of your driver's life. It is a fascinating look at why you would do APIs, and how there is almost always more than one dimension to why a company will deploy&nbsp;an API.</span></p>
<p><span>I am sure there are other reasons I am not considering here. Maybe now that I've planted the seed in my brain, I'll come up with some other incentives for why Uber operates their APIs as they do--it is fascinating stuff to unpack.</span></p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2017/introducing-the-periscope-producer-api"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/periscope_twitter.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It is common for API providers to be really private with their APIs, and we often hear about providers restricting access as time goes by. So, when API providers loosen up restrictions on their APIs, inviting wider use by developers, making them public--I think it is worth taking notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A recent example of this in the wild is from the API poster child Twitter, with their <a href="https://www.periscope.tv/">Periscope video service</a>. <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2017/introducing-the-periscope-producer-api">Twitter has announced that they are slowly opening up access to the Periscope video API</a>, something that has been only available to a handful of trusted partners, and via the mobile application--there was no way to upload a video without using your mobile device. Twitter is still "l<span>imiting access to fewer strategic partners for a period", but at least you can apply to see if your interests overlap with Twitters interests. It also sounds like Twitter will continue to widen access as time goes on, and as it makes sense to their Periscope strategy.</span></p>
<p>While I wished we lived in a world where API developers were all well behaved, and API providers could open up services to the public from day one, this isn't the reality we find on the web today. Twitter's cautious approach to rolling out the Periscope API should provide other API providers with an example of how you can do this sensibly, only letting in the API consumers that are in alignment with your goals. Slowly opening up, making sure the service is stable, and meets the needs of consumers, partners, as well as helps meet a platform's business objectives.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Twitter's approach to launching the Periscope API provides us with a positive example of how you can become more public APIs, instead of always locking things down. There is no single way to launch your APIs, but I'd say that Twitter's cautious approach is probably a good idea when you operate in such a competitive space, or when you don't have a lot of experience operating a fully public API--start with a handful of trusted partners, and open things up to a slightly wider group as you feel comfortable.</p>
<p>Thanks, Twitter for providing me with a positive example I can showcase--it is good to see that after a decade you can still launch new APIs, and understand the value of them to your core business--even amidst the often intense and volatile environment that is the Twitter platform.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_definitions_webconcepts_screenshot.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em>This is an article from the current edition of the&nbsp;<a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">API Evangelist industry guide to API definitions</a>. The guide&nbsp;is designed to be a summary of the world of API definitions, providing the reader with a recent summary of the variety of specifications that are defining the technology behind almost every part of our digital world.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Keeping up with the standards bodies like International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)&nbsp; can be a full-time job. Thankfully,&nbsp; Erik Wilde (<a href="https://twitter.com/dret">@dret</a>) has help simply and made the concepts and specifications that make the web work more accessible and easier to understand, with his <a href="http://webconcepts.info">WebConcepts.info</a> project.</p>
<p class="p1">According to Erik, &ldquo;the Web&rsquo;s Uniform Interface is based on a large and growing set of specifications. These specifications establish the shared concepts that providers and consumers of Web services can rely on. Web Concepts is providing an overview of these concepts and of the specifications defining them.&rdquo; His work is a natural fit for what I am trying to accomplish with my API definition industry guide, as well as supporting other areas of my research.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the areas that slows API adoption is a lack of awareness of the concepts and specifications that make the web work among developers who are providing and consuming APIs. The modern API leverages the same technology that drives the web--this is why it is working so well. The web is delivering HTML for humans, and APIs are using the same to deliver machine-readable data, content, and access to algorithms online. If a developer is not familiar with the fundamental building blocks of the web, the APIs they provide, and the applications they build on top of APIs will always be deficient.</p>
<p class="p1">This project provides an overview of 28 web concepts with 643 distinct implementations&nbsp; aggregated across five separate organizations including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Java Community Process (JCP), Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)--who all contribute to what we know as the web.&nbsp; An awareness and literacy around the 28 concepts aggregated by Web Concepts is essential for any API developer and architect looking to fully leverage the power of the web as part of their API work.</p>
<p class="p1">After aggregating the 28 web concepts from the five standards organization, Web Concepts additionally aggregates 218 actual specifications that API developers, architects, and consumers should be considering when putting APIs to work. Some of these specifications are included as part of this API Definition guide, and I will be working to add additional specifications in future editions of this guide, as it makes sense. The goal of this guide is to help bring awareness, literacy, and proficiency with common API and data patterns, making use of the work Web Concepts project, and building on the web literacy work already delivered by Erik, just makes sense.</p>
<p class="p1">Web Concepts is published as a Github repository, leveraging Github Pages for the website. He has worked hard to make the concepts and specification available as JSON feeds, providing a machine-readable feed that can be integrated into existing API design, deployment, and management applications--providing web literacy concepts and specifications throughout the API life cycle.&nbsp; All JSON data is generated from the source data, which is managed as a set of XML descriptions of specifications, with the build process based upon XSLT and Jekyll, providing multiple ways to approach all concepts and specifications, while maintaining the relationship and structure of all the moving parts that make up the web.</p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to the startup space, the concepts that make up the web, and the specifications that make it all work, might seem a little boring, something only the older engineers pay attention to.&nbsp; Web Concepts helps soften, and make these critical concepts and specifications accessible and digestible for a new generation of web and API developers--think of them as gummy versions of vitamins. If we are going to standardize how APIs are designed, deployed, and managed--making all of this much more usable, scalable, and interoperable, we are going to have to all get on the same page (aka the web).</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://webconcepts.info/">Web Concepts</a> is an open source project, and Erik encourages feedback on the concepts&nbsp;and specifications. I encourage you to spend time on the site regularly&nbsp;and see where you can integrate the JSON feeds into your systems, services, and tooling. We have a lot of work ahead of us to make sure the next generation of programmers have the base amount of web literacy necessary to keep the web strong and healthy. There are two main ways to contribute to the building blocks of the web: participate as a contributor to the standards body, or you can make sure you are implementing common concepts and specifications throughout your work, contributing to the web, and not just walled gardens and closed platforms.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Mar 2017</span>
        <p>I was studying examples of how I can validate the data returned from <a href="http://developer.open.referral.adopta.agency/">a human services APIs demo</a>, and develop a set of API tests, as well as API service providers who can implement the tests, for cities to consider as part of their API deployments that are serving up locations and organizations where you can find critical services. I'm looking for examples of the common things like API availability and response time, but I'm also looking to get very granular and specialized to organizational, location, and service APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.runscope.com/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/runscope_data_validation.png" alt="" width="95%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.runscope.com/">The image I borrowed from RunScope helps visualize what I'm talking about, showing us how we can keep an eye on the basics, but also getting really granular when specifying what we expect from of our APIs</a>. I have a pretty good imagination when it comes to thinking of scenarios I want to test for, but I'm also looking for any API providers who might be already sharing their tests&nbsp;and being more transparent when it comes to their API monitoring and testing practices. If you know of any API&nbsp;providers that would be willing to share the lists of what types of things they test for, I'd love to hear more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm thinking a regular blog series on different examples of how people are testing APIs from a diverse range of business sectors might help stimulate people's imagination when it comes to API testing concepts. I'm thinking it is another area that we could all learn a lot from each other&nbsp;if there was just a little bit of sharing. I'd love it if the examples were machine readable and reusable in any API testing service, but I would settle for just a blog post, or sharing of a bulleted list of API tests via email, or another channel. ;-)</p>

<p>Building on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/09/api-management-is-getting-more-modular-and-composable/">earlier stories about how my API partners are making API deployment more modular and composable</a>, and pushing forward my understanding of what is possible with API deployment, I'm looking into the details of what <a href="http://apis.how/bgdteovduo">DreamFactory</a> enables when it comes to API deployment. "<span>DreamFactory is a free, Apache 2 open source project that runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. DreamFactory is scalable, stateless, and portable" -- making it pretty good candidate for running it wherever you need.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/16/the-ability-to-deploy-apis-in-aws-google-or-microsoft-clouds/">After spending time at Google and hearing about how they want to enable multi-cloud infrastructure deployment</a>, I wanted to see how my API service provider partners are able to actually power these visions of running your APIs anywhere, in any infrastructure. <a href="https://www.dreamfactory.com/features">Using DreamFactory you can deploy your APIs using Docker, Kubernetes, or directly from a Github repository</a>, something I'm exploring as standard operating procedure for government agencies, like we see with <a href="https://github.com/18F/fs-middlelayer-api">18F's&nbsp;US Forest Service ePermit Middlelayer API</a>--in my opinion, all federal, state, and local government should be able to deploy API infrastructure like this.</p>
<p>One of the projects I am working on this week is creating a base blueprint of what it will take to deploy a <a href="http://developer.open.referral.adopta.agency/">human services API</a> for any city in Google or Azure. I have a demo working on AWS already, but I need a basic understanding of what it will take to do the same in any cloud environment. I'm not in the business of hosting and operating APIs for anyone, let alone for government agencies--this is why I have partners like DreamFactory, who I can route specific projects as they come in. Obviously, I am looking to support my partners, as they support me, but I'm also looking to help other companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies better leverage the cloud providers they are already using.</p>
<p>I'll share more stories about how I'm deploying APIs to AWS, as well as Google and Azure, as I do the work over the next couple of weeks. I'm looking to develop a healthy toolbox of solutions for government agencies to use. This weeks project is focused on the human services data specification, but next week I'm going to look replicating the model to allow for other <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org vocabulary</a>, providing simple blueprints for deploying other common APIs like products, directories, link listings, and directories. My goal is to provide a robust toolbox of APIs that anyone can launch in AWS, Google, and Azure, with a push of a button--eventually.</p>

<p class="p1"><em>This is an article from the current edition of the&nbsp;<a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">API Evangelist industry guide to API definitions</a>. The guide<span>&nbsp;is designed to be a summary of the world of API definitions, providing the reader with a recent summary of the variety of specifications that are defining the technology behind almost every part of our digital world.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">The OpenAPI Specification</a>, formerly known as Swagger is approaching an important milestone, version 3.0 of the specification, but it is also the first major release since the specification was entered into the Linux Foundation. Swagger was the creation of Tony Tam of Wordnik back in 2010, but after the project was acquired by SmartBear in 2015, the company donated the specification to the newly formed OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) which is part of the Linux Foundation. Swagger has now been reborn as the OpenAPI Specification, and in early 2017 is approaching its first major release under the guidance of a diverse group of governing members.</p>
<p class="p1">Version 3.0 of the API specification format has taken a much more modular, and reusable approach to defining the surface area of an API, enabling more power and versatility when it comes to describing the request and response models, as well as providing details on the common components that make up API usage like the underlying data schema and security definitions. There are numerous changes to the API specification, but there are just a handful that will have a significant impact across every stop along the API life cycle where API definitions are making an impact.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Hosts</strong></p>
<p class="p1">When describing your API, you can now provide multiple hosts, allowing you to better deal with the complexity of how APIs might be located in a single location, or spread across multiple cloud location, and global infrastructure.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Content Negotiation</strong></p>
<p class="p1">You can now provide content objects to define the relationship between response objects, media types, and schema, opening up the negotiation of exactly the type of content needed, encouraging the design of multiple rich dimensions for any single API resource.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Body</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The latest version of the specification plays catch-up when it comes to allowing the body of a request and response to be defined separately from the request parameters, allowing for more control over the payload of any API calls.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Schema</strong></p>
<p class="p1">There is an increased investment in JSON Schema, including the support of `oneOf`, `anyOf` and `not` functions, allowing for alternative schema, as well as the standard JSON schema definition included.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Components</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The new components architecture really reflects APIs, making everything very modular, reusable, and much more coherent and functional. The new version encourages good schema and component reuse,&nbsp; helping further bringing the definition into focus.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Linking</strong></p>
<p class="p1">While not quite full hypermedia, version 3.0 of the OpenAPI Spec supports linking, allowing for the description of relationships between paths, giving a nod towards hypermedia design pattern, making this version the most resilient so far.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Webhooks</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Like the nod towards hypermedia, the specification now allows for the inclusion of callbacks that can be attached to a subscription operation describing an outbound operation--providing much needed webhook descriptions as part of API operations, making it much more real time and event driven.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The new version enables API architects to better describe, and provide examples of APIs responses and requests, helping make API integration a learning experience, by providing examples for use beyond just documentation descriptions.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Responding to a large number of API providers, and the reality on the ground for many implementations, the new version allows for the definition of cookies as part of API requests.</p>
<p class="p1">These nine areas represent the most significant changes to the OpenAPI Spec 3.0. The most notable shift is the componentized, modular, reusable aspect of the specification. After that, it is the content negotiation, linking, web hooks, and other changes that are moving the needle. It is clear that the 3.0 version of the specification has considered the design patterns across a large number of implementations, providing a pretty wide-reaching specification for defining what an API does, in a world where every API can be a special snowflake.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2017, the OpenAPI Spec is the clear leader of the API definition formats, with the largest adoption, as well as the amount of tooling developed. While documentation and SDK generation are still the top two reasons for crafting API definitions, there are numerous other reasons for using API definitions including mocking, testing, monitoring, IDE integration, and much, much more. In 2017, the OpenAPI Spec is the clear leader of the API definitions format. It has the highest usage rate, as well as the largest number of tooling (or tools?) available.</p>

<p>I'm keeping an eye on the different approaches to deploying infrastructure coming out of AWS, Google, Microsoft and other providers. In my version of the near future, we should be able to deploy any API we want, in any infrastructure we want with a single push of a button. We are getting there, as&nbsp;<a href="https://t.co/IzZs6W0wAr">I'm seeing more publish to Heroku buttons</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/where-is-the-deploy-to-aws-and-google-button/">AWS and Azure deployment packages</a>, and I recently came across the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/launcher/">Google Cloud Launcher</a>, which I think will work well for deploying a variety of API driven solutions--we just need more selection&nbsp;and a button!</p>
<p>All the parts and pieces for this type of push button API deployment exist already, we just need someone to step up and provide a dead simple framework for defining and embedding the buttons, abstracting away the complexities of each cloud platform. I want to be able to take a single manifest for my open source or wholesale API on Github, and allow anyone to deploy it into Heroku, AWS, Google, Azure, or anywhere else they want. I want the technical, business, and legal complexities of deployment abstracted away for me, the API provider.</p>
<p>API management has matured a lot over the last 10 years, and API design and definitions are currently flourishing. We need a lot more investment in helping people easily deploy APIs, wherever they need. I think this layer of interoperability is the responsibility of the emerging API service providers like <a href="http://apis.how/5ytnitnakm">Restlet</a>, <a href="http://apis.how/bgdteovduo">DreamFactory</a>, or maybe even <a href="http://apis.how/kjtj5bbuxu">APIMATIC</a>. I will keep tracking on what I'm seeing evolve out of the leading cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and now Google with their Cloud Launcher. I will also keep pushing on my API service provider partners in the space to enable API deployment like this--I am guessing they will just need a little nudging to see the opportunity around providing API deployment in this seamless, cloud-agnostic way.</p>

<p><a href="http://google.stack.network/">I am working on profiling 75 of the Google APIs</a>, and one thing I struggle with at this scale is standardizing the images I use, or more specifically, icons that represent each service as well as the value they deliver under the hood--something Google seriously needs to get more organized in by the way. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/25/moving-towards-a-meaningful-set-of-icons-for-the-api-community/">I have written before about having a set of icons for the API sector</a>, for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/21/a-new-api-programming-language-sdk-icon-set/">SDK related icons</a>, and also <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/21/icons-to-describe-each-of-your-api-resources-like-aws/">about how Amazon is getting more organized when it comes to icons for the AWS platform</a>, as I beat this drum about the need for common imagery.</p>
<p>While I am glad that Amazon is started to think about iconography when it comes to working with APIs at scale, a lead that Google and Microsoft should follow, I'm hoping that API icons are something that someone will tackle at the same level as say a <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a>. I would like to see API provider (company) level icons, <a href="http://konpa.github.io/devicon/">building on the work of Devicon</a>, but I'd also like to see individual icons developed for common resources that are made available via APIs--like compute, storage, images, video, etc.</p>
<p>What Amazon is doing provides the best model we have so far, but I want to make sure icons are not vendor specific. I would like to see a universal icon to represent a compute API for instance, whether it was Amazon, Google, or Microsoft. Think about IFTTT or Zapier, but something that would universally represent the valuable bits and bytes we are putting to use via individual platforms, but are increasingly also moving around between platforms--I want a common visual iconography we can use to communicate about what is being done with APIs.</p>
<p>There is a ton of work involved with establishing a project of this scale. Ideally, it is something that would also involve API providers, and not just be an external thing. I'd also like to see each icon be more than just a visual icon, I'd like there to be semantics and vocabulary attached to each image. Imagine if we had a common set of icons describe machine learning APIs, that helped us quickly understand what they do, but would also help us more consistently articulate the reality of what they do, and do not do (ie. Facial Recognition, Sentiment Anlysis, etc.).</p>
<p>I am going to keep talking about this until someone either does it&nbsp;or gives me the money to pay someone to do it. Sadly, I feel like it will end up being like the rest of common API definitions and tooling, we'll see each provider do it on their own, where all meaning and vocabulary becomes platform-driven, and not about actually finding a common language to communicate about what is possible with APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_definitions_human_services_screenshot.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em>This is an article from the current edition of the <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">API Evangelist industry guide to API definitions</a>. The guide<span style="font-size: 9px;">&nbsp;is designed to be a summary of the world of API definitions, providing the reader with a recent summary of the variety of specifications that are defining the technology behind almost every part of our digital world.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1">A lot of attention is given to APIs and the world of startups, but in 2017 this landscape is quickly shifting beyond just the heart of the tech space, with companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies of all shapes and sizes are putting APIs to work. API definitions are being applied to the fundamental building blocks of the tech sector, quantifying the computational, storage, images, videos, and other essential resources powering web, mobile, and device based applications. This success is now spreading to other sectors, defining other vital resources that are making a real impact in our communities.</p>
<p class="p1">One API making an impact in communities is the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS), also known as the Open Referral Ohana API. The project began as a Code for America project, providing an API, website, and administrative system for managing the organizations, locations, and the human services that communities depend on. Open Referral, the governing organization for HSDS, and the Ohana API is working with API Evangelist and other partners to define the next generation of the human services data specification, API definition, as well as the next generation of API, website, admin, and developer portal implementations.</p>
<p class="p1">The HSDS Specification API isn&rsquo;t about any single API, it is a suite of API-first definitions, schema, and open tooling that cities, counties, states&nbsp;and federal government agencies can download or fork, and employ to help manage vital human services for their communities. Providing not just a website for finding vital services, but a complete API ecosystem that can be deployed incentivizing developers to build important web, mobile, and other applications on top of a central human services system. Better delivering on the mission of human services organizations, and meeting the demands of their constituents.</p>
<p class="p1">This approach to delivering APIs centers around a common data schema, extending it as an OpenAPI Spec definition, describing how that data is accessed&nbsp;and put to use across a variety of applications, including a central website and administrative system. While server-side HSDS API implementations, website, mobile, administrative, developer portal, and other implementations are important, the key to the success of this model is a central OpenAPI definition of the HSDS API. This definition connects all the implementations within an API&rsquo;s ecosystem, but it also provides the groundwork for a future where all human services implementations are open and interoperable with other implementations--establishing a federated network of services meeting the needs of the communities they serve.</p>
<p class="p1">Right now each city is managing one or multiple human service implementations. Even though some of these implementations operate in overlapping communities, few of them are providing 3rd party access, let alone providing integration between overlapping geographic regions. The HSDS API approach employs an API-first approach, focusing on the availability and access of the HSDS schema, then adding on a website, administrative and API developer portals to support. This model opens up human services to humans via the website, which is integrated with the central API, but then also opens up the human services for inclusion into other websites, mobile and device applications, as well as integration with other systems.</p>
<p class="p1">The HSDS OpenAPI spec and schema provide a reusable blueprint that can be used to standardize how we provide human services. The open source approach to delivering definitions, schema, and code reduces the cost of deployment and operation for cash-strapped public organizations and agencies. The API-first approach to delivering human services also opens up resources for inclusion in our applications and system, potentially outsourcing the heavy lifting to trusted partners, and 3rd party developers interested in helping augment and extend the mission of human service organizations and groups.</p>
<p class="p1">If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about the HSDS API you can visit <a href="http://openreferral.org">Open Referral</a>. From there you can get involved in the discussion, and find existing open source definitions, schema, and code for putting HSDS to work. If you&rsquo;d like to contribute to the project, there are numerous opportunities to join the discussion about next generation of the schema and OpenAPI Spec, as well as develop server-side&nbsp;and client-side implementations.</p>

<p>It is easy for me to get excited about a new API. I'm an engineer. I'm a dude. I am the API Evangelist. It easy to think about the potential for good when it comes to APIs. It is much harder to suspend the logical side of my brain&nbsp;and think about the ways in which APIs can be used in negative ways. As a technologist it is natural for me to focus in on the technology, and tune out the rest of the world--it is what we do. It takes a significant amount of extra effort to stop, suspend the portion of your brain that technology whispers to, and think about the unintended consequences, and the pros and cons of why we are doing APIs.</p>
<p>Technologists aren't very good at slowing down and thinking about the pros/cons of connecting something to the Internet, let alone whether or not an API should even exist in the first place (it has to exist!). <a href="http://www.securityweek.com/network-layer-ddos-attacks-hit-record-levels-imperva">As I read a story about the increases in DDOS attacks on the network layer of our online world</a>, I can't help but think that with each new API we deploy, that we are significantly increasing the attack surface area for our businesses, organizations, institutions, and government agencies. It feels like we are good at thinking about the amazing API potential, but we really suck at seeing what a target we are putting on our back when we do APIs.</p>
<p>We seem to be marching forward, drunk on the potential of APIs&nbsp;and Internet-connected everything. We aren't properly securing the technology we have, something we can see playing out with each wave of vulnerabilities, breaches, and leaks. We are blindly pushing forward with new API implementations, and using the same tactics we are using for our web and mobile technology, something we are seeing play out with the Internet of Things, and the vulnerable cameras, printers, and another object we are connecting to the Internet using APIs.</p>
<p>With each API we add, we are increasing the attack surface area for our systems and devices. APIs can be secured, but from what I'm seeing we aren't investing in security with our existing APIs, something that is being replicated with each wave of deployments. We need to get better at thinking about the negative consequences of doing APIs. We need to stop making ourselves targets. We need to get better at thinking about whether or not an API should exist or not. We need a way to better visualize the target surface area we've crafted for ourselves using APIs, and be a little more honest with ourselves about why we are doing this.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Mar 2017</span>

<p>This is my regular public service reminder of why I do API Evangelist. I do not evangelize APIs because I think everybody should be doing them, that they are the solution to all of our problems, or because I have an API I want you to buy (I have other things for you to buy). I do API Evangelist because I want to better understand how platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Uber, and others are operating&nbsp;and impacting our personal and professional lives.</p>
<p>I do believe in APIs as an important tool in our professional toolboxes, but Silicon Valley, our government(s), and many other bad actors have shown me that APIs will more often be used for shady things, rather than the positive API vision I have in my head. I still encourage companies, organizations, institutions,&nbsp;and agencies to do APIs, but I spend equal amount of time ensuring people are doing APIs in a more open and equitable way&nbsp;while still encouraging folks to also embark on their API journeys--taking more control over how we store, share, and put our bits and bytes to work each day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>APIs are playing a role in almost every news story we read today, from fake news and elections to cyber security,&nbsp;healthcare with the FHIR API standard, or banking with PSDS, to automobiles and transportation with Tesla and Uber. I can keep going all day long, talking about the ways APIs are influencing and delivering vital aspects of our personal and professional lives. In ALL of these situation's it's not the API that is important, it is the access, availability, and observability of the technology that is impacting the lives of humans--APIs are just the digital connector where our mobile phones and other devices are being connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>I like to regularly remind myself why the fuck I'm doing API Evangelist, so I don't burn out like I have before and end up roaming the streets foaming at the mouth again. I also do it to remind people of why I do API Evangelist, so they don't just think I'm a cheerleader for technology (rah rah rah, gooo&nbsp;APIs). My mission isn't just about APIs, it's ensuring APIs are in place and allow us to better understand the inputs and outputs of the technology invading all aspects of our lives. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/25/thinking-about-an-api-observability-stack/">Without the observability into the backend systems and algorithms</a> that are driving out personal and professional lives, we are screwed--which is why I do API Evangelist, to help ensure there is observability into how technology is impacting our world.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/google_spectrum_database.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Most of the APIs I look at are special snowflakes. The definition&nbsp;and designs employed are usually custom-crafted without thinking other existing APIs, or standards that already in place. There are several contributing factors to why this is, ranging from the types of developers who are designing APIs, to incentive models put in place because of investment&nbsp;and intellectual property constraints. So, whenever I find an API that is employing an existing standard, I feel compelled to showcase&nbsp;and help plant the seeds in others minds that we should be speaking a common language instead of always being a special snowflake.</p>
<p>One of these APIs that I came across recently was the <a href="https://developers.google.com/spectrum/v1">Google Spectrum Database API</a> which has employed a standard&nbsp;<span>defined by the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-paws-protocol/">IETF Protocol to Access White Space (PAWS)</a><span>. &nbsp;I wouldn't say the API is the best-designed API, but it does follow a known standard, that is already in use by an industry, which in my experience can go further than having the best-designed API. The best product doesn't always win in this game, sometimes it is just about getting adoption with the widest possible audience.&nbsp;</span>I am guessing that the Google Spectrum Database API is targeting a different type of engineering audience than their more modern, machine learning and other APIs are, so following standards is probably more of a consideration.</p>
<p><span>I wish more APIs would share a little bit about the thoughts that went into the definition and design of their APIs, sharing their due diligence of existing APIs and standards, and other considerations that were included in the process of crafting an API. I'd like to see some leadership in this area, as well as some folks admitting that they didn't have the time, budget, expertise, or whatever the other reasons why you are a special snowflake. It is a conversation we should be having, otherwise, we may never fully understand why we aren't seeing the adoption we'd like to see with our APIs.</span></p>

<p>My API definition research encompasses any specification, schema, or authentication and access scope used as part of API operations, providing a pretty wide umbrella. I am always on the hunt for <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/tools/">specifications, schema, media types, generators, parsers, converters, as well as semantics and discovery solutions</a> that are defining the layers of the API space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one reason I have my <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">OpenAPI Toolbox</a>, which helps focus my research into the fast-growing ecosystem developing around the <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI specification</a>. I'm always looking for people who are doing anything interesting with the OpenAPI specification. When I find one I get to work crafting &nbsp;a title, description, image, and project link so that I can add to&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox/blob/master/_data/tools.yaml">the OpenAPI Toolbox YAML file</a>, driving the toolbox website.

<p>My OpenAPI Toolbox is connected to my API definition research at the hip. The toolbox is just a sub-project for my wider API definition research. If you are doing anything interesting with API definitions, schema, or scope please let me know. I am happy to add to my API definition research. The best of the best from my <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition research</a> and the <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">OpenAPI Toolbox</a> will be included in my industry guide, receiving wider distribution than just my network of API Evangelist sites.</p>

<p>I keep an eye on over 70 areas of the API sector, trying to better understand how API providers are getting things done, and what services and tooling they are using, while also keeping my perspective as an API consumer--observing everything from the outside-in. The most important area of my research is <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com">API definitions</a>--where I pay attention to the specifications, schema, scopes, and other building blocks of the API universe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way my research works&nbsp;is that I keep an eye on the world of APIs through monitoring the social media, blogs, Github, and other channels of companies, organizations, institutions, and agencies doing interesting things with APIs. I curate information as I discover&nbsp;and learn across the API sector, then I craft stories for my blog(s). Eventually, all of this ends up being published <a href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/">to the main API Evangelist blog</a>, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">the 70+ individual areas of my research from definition to deprecation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a couple years now I have also published a guide for the top areas of my research, including API <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com">definitions</a>, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>. These guides have always been a complete snapshot of my research, but in 2017 I am rebooting them to be a more curated, summary of each area of my research. My API definition guide is now ready for prime time after receiving some feedback from my community, so I wanted to share with you.</p>
<p>I am versioning and managing all of my API industry guides using the Github repositories in which I publish each of my research areas, so you can comment on the API definition guide, and <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues">submit suggestions for future editions using the Github issues for the project.</a>&nbsp;My goal with this new edition of the API Evangelist API definition guide is to make it a community guide to the world of API definitions, schema, scopes. So please, let me know your thoughts--it is meant to be a community guide.</p>
<p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">I am keeping my API definition guide available for free to the public.</a> You can also <a href="https://gum.co/Wlwnk">purchase a copy via Gumroad if you'd like to support my work</a>--I depend on your support to pay the bills.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/20/google-support-buttons/">Google Support Buttons</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/15/the-relationship-between-dev-relations-and-support/">I talked about the gap between developer relations and support at Google</a>, something that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/15/the-relationship-between-dev-relations-and-support/">Sam Ramji (@sramji) has acknowledged is being worked on</a>. Support for a single API can be a lot of work&nbsp;and is something that is exponentially&nbsp;harder with each API and developer to add to your operations, and after <a href="http://google.stack.network/">looking through 75 of the Google APIs this weekend</a>, you see evidence that Google is working on it.</p>
<p>While there are many Google APIs that still have sub-standard support for their APIs, <a href="https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/support">when you look at Google Sheets you start seeing evidence of their evolved approach to support</a>, with a consistent set of buttons that tackle many of the common areas of <a href="http://support.apievangelist.com">API support</a>. For general questions, Google provides two buttons linked to StackOverflow:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_20_at_9.41.01_am.png" alt="" width="90%" /></p>
<p>The search just drops you into Stack Overflow, with the tag "google sheets api", and the ask a new question drops you into the Stack Overflow submit new question form. For bug reporting, they provide a similar set of buttons:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_20_at_9.45.01_am.png" alt="" width="90%" /></p>
<p>The search and report bug buttons drop you into the Google Code issues page for Google Sheets, leveraging the issues management for the Gooogle Code repository--something that can just as easily be done with Github issues. Then lastly, they provide a third set of buttons when you are looking to submit a feature:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_20_at_9.47.56_am.png" alt="" width="90%" /></p>
<p>Even though there is a typo on the first button, they also leverage Google Code issue management to handle all feature requests. Obviously working to centralize bug and feature reporting, and support management using Google Code--something I do across all my API projects using Github organizations, repositories, and their issue management. I'm guessing Google Support is tapping into Google Code to tackle support across projects at scale.</p>
<p>These support buttons may seem trivial, but they represent a more consistent approach by the API giant to be consistent in how they approach support across their API offerings--something that can go a long way in my experience. It gives your API consumers a familiar and intuitive way to ask questions, submit bugs, and suggest new features. Equally as important, I'm hoping it is also giving Google a consistent way to tackle support for their APIs in a meaningful way, that meets the needs of their API consumers.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/20/a-community-strategy-for-my-api-definition-guide/">A Community Strategy For My API Definition Guide</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_definitions_2017_03.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">tpublished the latest edition of my API definition guide</a>. I've rebooted my industry guides to be a more polished, summary version of my research instead of the rougher, more comprehensive version I've bee publishing for the last couple of years. I'm looking for my guides to better speak to the waves of new people entering the API space, and help them as they continue on their API journey.</p>
<p>In addition to being a little more polished, and having more curated content, my API guides are now going to also be more of a community thing. In the past I've kept pretty tight control over the content I publish to API Evangelist, only opening up the four logos to my partners. Using my API industry guides I want to invite folks from the community to help edit the content, and <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed">provide editorial feedback</a>--<a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues/6">even suggesting what should be in future editions</a>. I'm also opening up the guides to include paid content that will help pay for the ongoing publication of the guides with the following opportunities available in the next edition:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One Page Articles -</strong> Sponsored suggested topics, where I will craft the story and publish in the next edition of the guide--also published on API Evangelist blog after the guide is published.</li>
<li><strong>Two Page Articles&nbsp;-</strong> Sponsored suggested topics, where I will craft the story and publish in the next edition of the guide--also published on API Evangelist blog after the guide is published.Sponsor Slot -&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Sponsor Slot - </strong>On the service and tooling pages there are featured slots, some of which I will be giving to sponsors, who have related produces and services.</li>
<li><strong>Private Distribution - </strong>Allow for private distribution of the industry guide, to partners, and behind lead generation forms, allowing you to use API Evangelist research to connect with customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though I will be accepting paid content within these industry guides, and posts via the blog now, they will all be labeled as sponsored posts, and I will also still be adding my voice to each and every piece--if you know me, or read API Evangelist blog you know what this means. I'm looking to keep the lights on, while also opening up the doors for companies in the space to join in the conversation, as well as the average reader--allowing anyone to provide feedback and suggestions via <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues">the Github issues for each area of research</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com">My API definition research</a> is just the first to come off the assembly line. I will be applying this same model to my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a> research in coming weeks, and eventually <a href="http://apievangelist.com">the rest of my research as it makes sense</a>. If there is a specific research area you'd like to see get attention&nbsp;or would be willing to sponsor in one of the ways listed above, <a href="mailto: kin@apievangelist.com">please let me know</a>. Once I get the core set of my API industry research guides published in this way, I will be working on increasing the distribution beyond just my network of sites, and the API Evangelist digital presence--publishing them to Amazon, and other prominent ecosystems.</p>
<p>I also wanted to take a moment and <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/05/28/the-community-has-spoken-api-evangelist-will-stay-as-it-is/">thank everyone in the community who helped m last </a><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/05/28/the-community-has-spoken-api-evangelist-will-stay-as-it-is/">year</a>&nbsp;and for everyone who is helping make my research, and the publishing of these industry guides a reality. Your support is important to me, and it is also important to me that my research continues, and is as widely available as it possibly can.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/openapi_spec_structural_improvements.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am spending some time adding more tools to <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">my OpenAPI Toolbox</a>, and I'm looking to start evaluating what it will take for tooling providers to evolve their solution from version 2.0 of the OpenAPI Spec to version 3.0. I want to better understand what it will take to evolve the documentation, generators, servers, clients, editors, and other tools that I'm tracking on as part of my toolbox research.</p>
<p>I'm going to spend another couple of weeks populating the toolbox with OpenAPI solutions. Getting them entered with all the relevant metadata. Once I feel the list is good enough, I will begin reaching out to each tool owner, asking what their OpenAPI 3.0 plans are. It will give me a good reason to reach out and see if anyone is even home. I'm assuming that a number of the projects are abandoned, and even that their owners do not have the resources necessary to go from 2.0 to 3.0. Regardless, this is something I want to track on as part of this OpenAPI toolbox research.</p>
<p>The overall architecture of OpenAPI shifted pretty significantly from 2.0 to 3.0. Things are way more modular, and reusable&nbsp;in there, something that will take some work to bring out in most of the tooling areas. Personally, I'm pretty excited for the opportunities when it comes to API documentation and API design editors with OpenAPI 3.0 as the core. I am also hoping that developers step up to make sure that the generators, as well as the server and client code generators become available in a variety of programming languages--we will need this to make sure we keep the momentum that we've established with the specification so far.</p>
<p>If you are looking at developing any tooling using OpenAPI 3.0 I'd love to hear from you. I'd like to hear more about what it will take to either migrate your tool from version 2.0 to 3.0&nbsp;or even hear what it will take to get up and running on 3.0 from scratch. I'm going to get to work on crafting my first OpenAPI definition using version 3.0, then I'm going to begin playing around with some new approaches to API documentation and possibly an API editor or notebook that takes advantage of the changes in the OpenAPI Specification.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_google_aws_microsoft.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spent a day last week at the Google Community Summit, learning more about the Google Cloud road map, and one thing I kept hearing them focus on was the notion of being able to operate on any cloud platform--not just Google. It's a nice notion, but how real of a concept is it to think we could run seamlessly on any of the top cloud platforms--Google, AWS, and Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept is something I'll be exploring more with my <a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral</a>, Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) work. It's an attractive concept, to think I could run the same API infrastructure in any of the leading cloud platforms. I see two significant hurdles in accomplishing this: 1) Getting the developer and IT staff (me) up to speed, and 2) Ensuring your databases and code all runs and scales seamlessly whichever platforms you operate in. I guess I'd have to add 3) Ensure your orchestration and continuous integration works seamlessly across all platforms you operate on.</p>
<p>I am going to get to work deploying an HSDS compliant API on each of the platforms. My goal is to have just a simple yet complete API infrastructure running on Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. It is important to me that these solutions provide a complete stack helping me manage DNS, monitoring, and other important aspects. I'm also looking for there to be APIs for managing all aspects of my API operations--this is how I orchestrate and continuously integrate the APIs which I roll out.</p>
<p>Along with each API that I publish, I will do a write up on what it took to stand up each one, including the cloud services I used, and their API definitions. I am pretty content (for now) on the AWS platform, leveraging Github Pages as the public facade for my projects, and each repositories acting as the platform gears of API code, and definitions. Even though I'm content where I am at, I want to ensure the widest possible options available to cities, and other organizations who are looking to deploy and manage their human service APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/autocomplete.gif,qx38712.pagespeed.ce.mdv9wuhtbw.gif" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>The Postman team has been hard at work lately,&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.getpostman.com/2017/02/28/introducing-the-new-data-editor/">releasing their API data editor</a>, as well as <a href="http://blog.getpostman.com/2017/03/07/autocomplete-and-tooltips-for-variables-are-here/">introducing variable highlighting and tooltips</a>. The new&nbsp;<span>autocomplete menu contains a list of all the variables in the current environment, followed by global variables, making your API environment setups more accessible from the Postman interface. Introducing a pretty significant time saver, once you have your environments setup properly.</span></p>
<p>This is a pretty interesting feature, but what makes me most optimistic, is when this approach becomes available for parameters, headers, and some of the data management features we are seeing emerge with the new Portman data editor. It all feels like the UI equivalent of what <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/25/the-openapi-specification-version-30-highlights/">we've seen emerge in the latest OpenAPI 3.0 release</a>, helping us better manage and reuse the schema, data, and other bits we put to use across all of our APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine when you can design and mock your API in Postman, crafting our API&nbsp;using a common vocabulary. Reusing environment variables, API path resources, parameters, headers, and other common elements already in use across operations. Imagine when I get tooltip suggesting that I use <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org vocabulary</a>, or possibly even RFCs for a date, currency, and other common definitions. Anyways, I'm liking the features coming out of postman, and I'm also liking that they are regularly blogging about this stuff, so I can keep up to speed on what is going on, and eventually cover here on the blog, and include in my research.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_12_at_11.20.06_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I wanted to provide an easy way to publish and share some of the tools that I'm tracking on in the <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a> ecosystem, so I launched <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">my API toolbox</a>. In addition to tracking on the name, description, logo, and URL for OpenAPI tooling, I also wanted to categorize them, helping me better understand the different types of tools that are emerging. As I do with all my research, <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox">I published the OpenAPI Toolbox as a Github repository</a>, leveraging <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox/blob/master/_data/tools.yaml">its YAML data core to store all the tools</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be a never ending project for me to add, update, and archive abandoned projects, but before I got too far down the road I wanted to also begin tracking on the license for each of the tools. I'm still deciding whether or not I want the toolbox to exclusively contain openly licensed tools, or look to provide a more comprehensive directory of tooling that includes unknown and proprietary solutions. I think for now I will just flag any tool I cannot find a license for, and follow up with the owner--it gives me a good excuse to reach out and see if there is anyone home.</p>
<p>Eventually, I want to also provide a search for the toolbox that allows users to search for tools&nbsp;and filter by license. Most of the tools have been Apache 2.0 or MIT license, details that I will continue to keep tracking and reporting on. If you know of any tooling that employs the OpenAPI Specification that should be included feel free to <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox/issues">submit a Github issue for the project</a>, or submit a pull request on the repository and add it <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox/blob/master/_data/tools.yaml">to the YAML data file that drives that OpenAPI Toolbox</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/schema-org/schema-org.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was following <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/pull/1445">the discussion around adding a&nbsp;WebAPI class</a> to Schema.org's core vocabulary, and it got me to think more about the role Schema.org has to play with not just our API definitions, but also significantly influencing API discovery. Meaning that we should be using Schema.org as part of our OpenAPI definitions, providing us with a common vocabulary for communicating around our APIs, but also empowering the discovery of APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I describe the relationship between Schema.org to API discovery, I'm talking about using <a href="http://pending.webschemas.org/WebAPI">the pending WebAPI class</a>, but I'm also talking about using common Schema.org org within API definitions--something that will open the definitions to discovery because it employs a common schema. I am also talking about how do we leverage this vocabulary in our HTML pages, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data">helping search engines like Google understand there is an API service available</a>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/4fd35c3a5ab20881f86283bc001137ab.js"></script>
<p>I&nbsp;will also be exploring how I can better leverage Schema.org in <a href="http://apisjson.org">my APIs.json&nbsp;format</a>, better leveraging a common vocabulary describing API operations, not just an individual API. I'm looking to expand the opportunities for discovering, not limit them. I would love all APIs to take a page from the hypermedia playbook, and have a machine readable index for each API, with a set of links present with each response, but I also want folks to learn about APIs through Google, ensuring they are indexed in a way that search engines can comprehend.</p>
<p>When it comes to <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> I am primarily invested in APIs.json (because it's my baby) describing API operations, and <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> to describe the surface area of an API, but I also want this to map to the very SEO driven world we operate in right now. I will keep investing time in helping folks use Schema.org in their API definitions (APIs.json&nbsp;&amp; OpenAPI), but I will also start investing in folks employing JSON+LD and Schema.org as part of their search engine strategies (like above), making our APIs more discoverable to humans as well as other systems.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-connection.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I saw an interesting chasm emerge while at a Google Community Summit this last week, while I heard their support team talk, as well as their developer relations team discuss what they were up to. During the discussion, one of the companies presents discussed how their overall experience with the developer relations team has been amazing, their experience with support has widely been a pretty bad experience--revealing a potential gap between the two teams.</p>
<p>This is a pretty common gap I've seen with many other API platforms. The developer relations team is all about getting the word out, and encouraging platform usage&nbsp;and support teams are there to be the front line for support&nbsp;and being the buffer between integration, and platform engineering teams. I've been the person in the role as the evangelist when there is a bug in an API, and I'm at the mercy of an already overloaded engineering team, and QA staff, before anything gets resolved--this is a difficult position to be in.</p>
<p>How wide this chasm becomes ultimately depends on how much of a priority the API is for an engineering team, and how overloaded they are. I've worked on projects where this chasm is pretty wide, taking days, even weeks to get bugs fixed. I'm guessing this is something a more DevOps&nbsp;focused approach to the API life cycle might help with, where an API developer relations and support team have more access to making changes&nbsp;and fixing bugs--something that has to be pretty difficult to deal with at Google scale.</p>
<p>Anyways, I thought the potential chasm between developer relations and support was worthy&nbsp;enough to discuss and include in my research. It is something we all should be considering no matter how big or small our operations are. There is no quicker way to kill the morale of your API developer relations and support teams by allowing a canyon like this to persist. What challenges have you experienced when it comes to getting support from your API provider? Or inversely, what challenges have you faced supporting your APIs or executing on your developer outreach strategy? I'm curious if other folks are feeling this same pain.</p>

<p>In 2017 <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/10/hoping-schema-becomes-just-as-important-as-api-definitions-in-2017/">I think that getting our act together when it comes to our data&nbsp;schema</a> will prove to be just as important as getting it together when it comes to our API definitions and design. This is one reason I'm such a big fan of using OpenAPI to define our APIs because it allows us to better organize the schema of the data included as part of the API request and response structure. So I am happy to see <a href="http://blog.getpostman.com/2017/02/28/introducing-the-new-data-editor/">Postman announce their new data editor</a>, something I'm hoping will help us make sense of the schema we are using throughout our API operations.</p>
<p>The Postman data editor provides us with some pretty slick data management UI features including&nbsp;drag and drop, a wealth of useful keyboard shortcuts, bulk actions, and other timesaving features. Postman has gone a long way to inject awareness into how we are using APIs over the last couple of years, and the data editor will only continue developing this awareness when it comes to the data we are passing back and forth. Lord knows&nbsp;we need all the help we can get&nbsp;when it comes to getting our data backends in order.</p>
<p>The Postman data editor makes me happy, but I'm most optimistic about what it will enable, and what Postman has planned as part of their roadmap. They end their announcement with <em>"we</em><span><em>&nbsp;have a LOT of new feature releases planned to build on top of this editor, capabilities inspired by things you already do </em>using<em>&nbsp;spreadsheets"</em>. For me, this points to some features that would directly map to the most ubiquitous data tools out there--the spreadsheet. With a significant&nbsp;portion of business in the world is done via spreadsheets, it makes the concept of integration into the API toolchain a pretty compelling thing.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2017/03/07/visual-studio-2017-productivity-performance-and-partners/">I was reviewing the latest changes with Visual Studio 2017</a>&nbsp;and came across the section introducing connected services, providing a glimpse of Microsoft APIs baked into the integrated development environment (IDE). <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/06/18/integrated-development-environment-ide-for-apis/">I've been pushing for more API availability in IDE's for some time now</a>, something that is not new, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/expanding-the-layer-of-api-discovery-from-within-the-developers-ide/">with Google and SalesForce having done it for a while</a>, but is something I haven't seen any significant movement in for a while now.</p>
<p>I have talked about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/27/apisjson-driven-api-dictionaries-for-use-in-atom-ide-autocomplete-packages/">delivering APIs in Atom using APIs.json</a>, and have <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/bing-developer-assistant-for-visual-studio-delivers-relevant-api-code/">long hoped Microsoft would move forward with this in Visual Studio</a>. All APIs should be discoverable from within any IDE, it just makes sense as a frontline for API discovery, especially when we are talking about developers. Microsoft's approach focuses on connecting developers of&nbsp;mobile applications, with <em>"the first Connected Service we are providing for mobile developers enables you to connect your app to an Azure App Service backend, providing easy access to authentication, push notifications, and data storage with online/offline sync".</em></p>
<p><span>In the picture, you can see Office 365 APIs, but since I don't have Visual Studio I can't explore this any further. If you have any insight into these new connected services features in the IDE, please let me know your thoughts and experiences. If Microsoft was smart, all their APIs would be seamlessly integrated into Visual Studio, as well as allow developers to easily import any other API using OpenAPI, or Postman Collections.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>While I think that IDEs are still relevant to the API development life cycle I feel like maybe there is a reason IDEs haven't caught up in this area. It feels like a need that API lifecycle tooling like <a href="http://getpostman.com">Postman</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://restlet.com/modules/client/">Restlet Client</a>, and <a href="http://stoplight.io">Stoplight</a> are stepping up to service the area. Regardless I will keep an eye on. It seems likno-braineriner for Microsoft to make their APIs available via their own IDE products, but maybe we are headed for a different future where a new breed of tools helps us more easily integrate APIs into our applications--no code necessary.</p>

<p>I was learning more about <a href="http://www.grpc.io/">gRPC</a> from the Google team last week, while at the Google Community Summit, as well as the API Craft SF Meetup. I'm still learning about gRPC, and how it contributes to the API conversation, so I am trying to share what I learn as I go, keeping a record for others to learn from&nbsp;along the way. One thing I wanted to better understand was something I kept hearing regarding gRPC delivering more of a tighter API contract between API provider and consumer.</p>
<p>In contrast to more RESTful APIs, a gRPC client has to be generated by the provider. First, you define a service in a .proto file (aka Protocol Buffer), then you generate client code using the protocol buffer compiler. Where client SDKs are up for debate in the world of RESTful APIs, and client generation might even be frowned upon in some circles, when it comes to gRPC APIs, client generation is a requirement--dictating a much&nbsp;tighter coupling and contract, between API provider and consumer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not have the first-hand experience with this process yet, I am just learning from my discussions last week, and trying to understand how gRPC is different from the way we've been doing APIs using a RESTful approach. So far it seems like you might want to consider gRPC if you are looking for significant levels of performance from your APIs, in situations where you have a tighter relationship with your consumers, such as internal, or partner scenarios. gRPC requires a tighter API contract between provider and consumer, something that might not always be possible, depending on the situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I'm still getting up to speed, it seems to me that the .proto file, or the protocol buffer definition acts as the language for this API contract. Similar to how <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI is quickly becoming a contract for more RESTful API</a>s, although it is often times much looser contract. I'll keep investing time into learning about gRP, but. I wanted to make sure and process what I've learned leading up to, and while at Google this last week. I'm not convinced yet that gRPC is the future of APIs, but I am getting more convinced <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/10/focus-on-having-a-robust-and-diverse-api-toolbox/">that it is another important tool in our API toolbox</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/schema-org/schema-org.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was following <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/pull/1445">the discussion around adding a&nbsp;WebAPI class</a> to Schema.org's core vocabulary, and it got me to think more about the role Schema.org has to play with not just our API definitions, but also significantly influencing API discovery. Meaning that we should be using Schema.org as part of our OpenAPI definitions, providing us with a common vocabulary for communicating around our APIs, but also empowering the discovery of APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I describe the relationship between Schema.org to API discovery, I'm talking about using <a href="http://pending.webschemas.org/WebAPI">the pending WebAPI class</a>, but I'm also talking about using common Schema.org org within API definitions--something that will open the definitions to discovery because it employs a common schema. I am also talking about how do we leverage this vocabulary in our HTML pages, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data">helping search engines like Google understand there is an API service available</a>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/4fd35c3a5ab20881f86283bc001137ab.js"></script>
<p>I&nbsp;will also be exploring how I can better leverage Schema.org in <a href="http://apisjson.org">my APIs.json&nbsp;format</a>, better leveraging a common vocabulary describing API operations, not just an individual API. I'm looking to expand the opportunities for discovering, not limit them. I would love all APIs to take a page from the hypermedia playbook, and have a machine readable index for each API, with a set of links present with each response, but I also want folks to learn about APIs through Google, ensuring they are indexed in a way that search engines can comprehend.</p>
<p>When it comes to <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> I am primarily invested in APIs.json (because it's my baby) describing API operations, and <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> to describe the surface area of an API, but I also want this to map to the very SEO driven world we operate in right now. I will keep investing time in helping folks use Schema.org in their API definitions (APIs.json&nbsp;&amp; OpenAPI), but I will also start investing in folks employing JSON+LD and Schema.org as part of their search engine strategies (like above), making our APIs more discoverable to humans as well as other systems.</p>

<p>In 2017 <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/10/hoping-schema-becomes-just-as-important-as-api-definitions-in-2017/">I think that getting our act together when it comes to our data&nbsp;schema</a> will prove to be just as important as getting it together when it comes to our API definitions and design. This is one reason I'm such a big fan of using OpenAPI to define our APIs because it allows us to better organize the schema of the data included as part of the API request and response structure. So I am happy to see <a href="http://blog.getpostman.com/2017/02/28/introducing-the-new-data-editor/">Postman announce their new data editor</a>, something I'm hoping will help us make sense of the schema we are using throughout our API operations.</p>
<p>The Postman data editor provides us with some pretty slick data management UI features including&nbsp;drag and drop, a wealth of useful keyboard shortcuts, bulk actions, and other timesaving features. Postman has gone a long way to inject awareness into how we are using APIs over the last couple of years, and the data editor will only continue developing this awareness when it comes to the data we are passing back and forth. Lord knows&nbsp;we need all the help we can get&nbsp;when it comes to getting our data backends in order.</p>
<p>The Postman data editor makes me happy, but I'm most optimistic about what it will enable, and what Postman has planned as part of their roadmap. They end their announcement with <em>"we</em><span><em>&nbsp;have a LOT of new feature releases planned to build on top of this editor, capabilities inspired by things you already do </em>using<em>&nbsp;spreadsheets"</em>. For me, this points to some features that would directly map to the most ubiquitous data tools out there--the spreadsheet. With a significant&nbsp;portion of business in the world is done via spreadsheets, it makes the concept of integration into the API toolchain a pretty compelling thing.</span></p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_12_at_1.24.18_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spent last week in San Francisco listening to Google's very machine learning focused view of the future. In addition to their Google Next conference, I spent Tuesday at the Google Community Summit, getting an analyst look at what they are up to. Machine Learning (ML) was definitely playing a significant role in their strategy, and I heard a lot talk of machine learning marketplaces.</p>
<p>Beyond their own ML offerings like <a href="https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/">video intelligence</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/">vision APIs</a>, Google also provides you with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/09/google-cloud-machine-learning-now-open-to-all-with-new-professional-services-and-education-programs">an engine for publishing your own ML models</a>. They also have a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/asl/">machine learning advanced solution lab</a>, throwing a <a href="https://cloudplatformonline.com/Machine-Learning-Startup-Competition.html">machine learning hackathon</a>, and pushing a <a href="http://cloud.google.com/certification">machine learning certification program</a>&nbsp;as part of their cloud and data offerings. As the Google machine learning roadmap was being discussed throughout the day, the question of where can I publish my ML models, and begin selling them, came up regularly--something I feel like is going to be a common theme of the 2017 ML hype.</p>
<p>I'm guessing we will see a relationship between the Google ML engine, Google Cloud Endpoints emerge, and eventually some sort of ML marketplace like we have with <a href="https://algorithmia.com/">Algorithmia</a>. We are already seeing this shift in the AWS landscape, between their Lambda, ML, API Gateway, and AWS Marketplace offerings. You see hints of the future in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/28/the-aws-serverless-api-portal/">the AWS serverless API portal</a> I wrote about previously. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/03/exploring-the-economics-of-wholesale-and-retail-algorithmic-apis/">The technology, business, and politics of providing retail and wholesale access to algorithms and machine learning models in this way fascinates me</a>, but as with every other successful area of the API economy, about 90% of this will be shit, and 10% will be actually doing anything interesting with compute&nbsp;and APIs.</p>
<p><a href="http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/2017/01/03/learning-about-machine-learning-apis-with-my-algorithmic-rotoscope-work/">I'm doing all my image and video texture transfer machine learning model training using AWS and Algorithmia</a>. I then use Algorithmia to get access to the models I've trained, and if I ever want to open up partner level (wholesale), or public (retail) access to my ML Models I will use Algorithmia, or an API facade on top of their API to open up access, and make available in the <a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms">Algorithmia ML marketplace</a>. I'm guessing at some point I will want to syndicate my models into other marketplace environments, with giants like Google and AWS, but also other more niche, specialty ML marketplaces, where I can reach exactly the audience I want.</p>
