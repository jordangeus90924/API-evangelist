<p>I look through a lot of API developer portals and when I come across interesting layouts I like to pause and highlight them showing to other API providers what is possible, while turning API Evangelist into a sort of style guid when it comes to crafting your API operations. I was asking the folks over at 3dcart if they have an OpenAPI or Postman collection for their API to help me round of my machine readable index of the commerce API provider, and after I stumbled across <a href="http://developer.3dcart.com/">their developer portal</a>, I thought I'd share here.</p>

<p>I like it because in addition to the global navigation for their portal, it really gets at the primary next steps anyone will be taking off the landing page of their developer portal. You can tell it really forced them to pause and think about the narrative around what people will be looking for. Helping people understand what is possible, while also routing them down the most common paths taken when it comes to <a href="http://developer.3dcart.com/">building an application on 3dcart</a>.</p>
