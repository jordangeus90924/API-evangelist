	<h3>The API Evangelist Blog</h3>
	<p>This blog is dedicated to understanding the world of APIs, exploring a wide range of topics from design to deprecation, and spanning the technology, business, and politics of APIs. <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-evangelist" target="_blank">All of this runs on Github, so if you see a mistake, you can either fix by submitting a pull request, or let us know by submitting a Github issue for the repository</a>.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/07/16/dwollas-new-developer-area-is-not-just-for-developers/">Dwolla&#039;s New Developer Area is Not Just for Developers</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">16 Jul 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/dwolla/dwolla-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Next generation payment platform <a title="Dwolla" href="/admin/blog/dwolla.com">Dwolla</a> just revamped the home page of their developer center to speak to the widest audience possible.  When you land at <a title="developers.dwolla.com" href="http://developers.dwolla.com">developers.dwolla.com</a> you are given two options:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="I can code" href="http://developers.dwolla.com/dev">I can code</a></strong> - You know the difference between Java and JavaScript and just want to dive into our API documentation</li>
<li><strong><a title="I don't code" href="http://developers.dwolla.com/bd/why">I don't code</a></strong> - You're a non-technical executive, the master of partnerships and products, and want to know why Dwolla is right for you</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an approach I've been long advocating for, and rarely see in API areas. The best case study I always point out is the <a title="LinkedIn developers area" href="https://developer.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn developers area</a>, who provide buttons, widgets and embeddable tools that non-developers can put to use.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://developers.dwolla.com/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/dwolla/Dwolla-Developer-Area.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>Why do this? Well according to Dwolla, "One of the biggest misunderstandings about API portals is that their purpose is only for developers. That&rsquo;s just not true. Integrations start with a spark of curiosity, &ldquo;Would this work for my company?&rdquo; Technical or not, who asks that question is irrelevant at that point; how it&rsquo;s answered is what determines the outcome."</p>
<p>Dwolla's approach reflects the core philosophy of why I started API Evangelist.  I'm not advocating just to developers about the power of APIs, I'm evangelizing to the business leaders and decision makers about the power of APIs.</p>
<p>While actually integrating with your API might be a technical endeavor, much of the business decision around using your API will most likely be made by a non-developer.  Make sure your API speaks more than just geek, and reaches as wide an audience as possible.</p>

<p>As we continue to stress over all the news of <a title="API Ecosystem Battles" href="/2012/06/29/the-api-economy-welcomes-its-early-trade-wars/">API ecosystem battles</a>, and how APIs owners are evil, and once a business grows up, it has to choose between being a hobby developer platform or real grown up business--let&rsquo;s remember the <a title="web API pioneers" href="/2011/02/10/history-of-apis-birth-through-social/">web API pioneers</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Salesforce" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">Salesforce</a>, <a title="ebay" href="/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">eBay</a> and <a title="Amazon" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a> are all three going strong, making money, treating developers as part of the equation and continue to operate legitimate business via APIs for over a decade now.  These three API pioneers set the stage for the API industry during the first &ldquo;dot com bubble&rdquo; in 2000 and Amazon in 2002, and 10 years later still proving you can become an Internet powerhouse with the help of your API developer ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/ebay/ebay-developer-program-history.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>API skeptics always step up and say they are different, that they have core web products, existing business models, etc. Sure, there are differences, but Salesforce, eBay and Amazon have all managed to achieve success with continued investment in their API ecosystem.  None of these platforms have had to restrict or shed their developers to make ends meet, once the utopian API early days are over.</p>
<p>When I read comments, tweets and other noise from people about what fools developers are for depending on an API, I stop and think about these API pioneers.  Developing a large, healthy API ecosystem is not easy--but when you see your API as an essential part of your core platform, and give it the necessary resources, you can strike the harmonious balance necessary to make APIs work.</p>

<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/02/online-flashmob-platform-mobber-suspended-from-twitter-api-for-promoted-trends-copycat/">According to Techcrunch</a>, Twitter suspended <a title="Mobber" href="http://www.mobber.net/">Mobber</a>, a platform that rewards users for distributing promoted content through their social media accounts, from using the Twitter API.</p>
<p>Mobber's service is obviously in direct competition with <a title="Twitter's Promoted Trends" href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/282142-promoted-trends">Twitter's Promoted Trends</a>, part of Twitter's suite of advertising products, which also includes promoted accounts and promoted Tweets.</p>
<p>Of course it's Twitter's platform, they can shut off anyone's access, and easily file it under a terms of service violation.  But ultimately wouldn't it make more sense if <a title="Twitter opened it's advertising platform with APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/29/api-driven-twitter-advertising/">Twitter opened it's advertising platform with APIs,</a> and allowed developers to innovate, enabling Twitter to still make money, but providing a much wider reach and audience?</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-voice/oraclevgoogle/oraclevgoogle.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m closely following the <a title="Oracle v Google" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/05/judge-oracle-google/">Oracle v Google</a> case playing out in a court of law right now, and more specifically the Tweet stream of Wired writer, <a title="Caleb Garling" href="https://twitter.com/#!/calebgarling">Caleb Garling</a>.</p>
<p>According to Garling:</p>
<blockquote><em>"A jury has ruled that Google infringed on Oracle&rsquo;s copyrights in building a new version of the Java platform for its Android mobile operating system, but it was unable to reach a decision on whether this infringement was acceptable under the law."</em></blockquote>
<p><a title="Google quickly moved for a mistrial based upon this incomplete decision" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/05/oracle-google-verdict/">Google quickly moved for a mistrial based upon this incomplete decision</a>, and in a statement to <a title="Wired" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/05/judge-oracle-google/">Wired</a>, Google says:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We appreciate the jury's efforts, and know that fair use and infringement are two sides of the same coin,&rdquo; reads a canned statement from Google sent to Wired. "The core issue is whether the APIs here are copyrightable, and that&rsquo;s for the court to decide. We expect to prevail on this issue and Oracle&rsquo;s other claims".</em></blockquote>
<p>The case is now moving into other areas which include patent infringement, but today&rsquo;s portion is what I&rsquo;m most concerned about, dealing with the API copyright vs. fair use, when Google "mimicked" 37 APIs used by the Java platform while building a new Java engine for Android.  While Java APIs</p>
<p>During this case Judge William Alsup defined copyright by saying:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Copyright protects the "expression of ideas" but not a procedures, processes, systems, methods of operation, concepts, principles, or discoveries."</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not 100% sure where I stand on copyright of APIs, I have a lot more education and contemplation to do on the subject.   My gut reaction is concern.  If you can&rsquo;t mimic an API interface, what will this do for innovation and growth in the API space?</p>
<p><a title="PInboard API" href="http://pinboard.in/api/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/pinboard/pinboard_in_blue.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One API I depend on daily is the <a title="PInboard API" href="http://pinboard.in/api/">Pinboard API</a>.  Pinboard provides an essential bookmarking API I use in my curation, which is modeled after <a title="Delicious" href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a>.  This is right off the Pinboard API documentation page:</p>
<blockquote><em>"In order to make life convenient for developers, wherever possible the Pinboard API uses the same syntax and method names as the Delicious V1 API. See differences from Delicious for a full list of areas where the APIs diverge."</em></blockquote>
<p>And similarly <a href="https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/reference/v1/apiversion1">Google Cloud Storage API v1</a> is interoperable with a some cloud storage tools and libraries that work with services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Eucalyptus Systems, Inc. To use these tools and libraries, all you do is change the request endpoint (URI) that the tool or library uses so it points to the Google Cloud Storage URI, and your up and running.</p>
<p>This kind of interoperability is critical to growth and innovation in all areas of the API sector.  What if <a title="AVOS Systems" href="http://www.avos.com/">AVOS Systems</a> (owners of Delicious) decided to file for copyright on the Delicioius API, where would this leave Pinboard?  Or what if Amazon copyrighted the web API for EC2 and S3?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.  I only know enough to be concerned at this point.  There aren&rsquo;t many answers right now.  But to quote Jonathan Schwartz, Sun CEO:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We wanted to build the biggest tent and invite as many people as possible,&rdquo; Schwartz said. &ldquo;You have open APIs and compete on implementations."</em></blockquote>

<p>Acquisition of technology startups by companies is a regular part of business today, providing a way for these companies to get the technology, talent, as well as user and market share they need to be successful. These acquisitions play an important part of API ecosystems, with API owners hoping developers build the next killer feature that users will love, something they can invest in, and developers dream API owners will notice their work and purchase their &ldquo;startup&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Looking back at the acquisitions made by a company can function as a sort of &ldquo;tea leaves&rdquo;, allowing us to interpret the companies motivations, possibly telling us where they are headed and who they might acquire next. As part of my&nbsp;<a title="Twitter research" href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">Twitter research</a>&nbsp;I wanted to look at the acquisitions made by Twitter over its six year history:</p>

<p>Twitter&rsquo;s acquisitions are diverse and appear to be very strategic. Twitter has wisely invested in search, security, messaging and data storage, while also taking control over mobile and desktop clients. &nbsp;Twitter has made some smart acquisitions out of the ecosystem, and you have to wonder why acquisitions of companies like Tweetie and TweeDeck caused such a backlash, while acquisitions like Backtype, Julpan and Dasient you don&rsquo;t hear much of anything from the ecosystem.</p>
<p>I would like to understand other players in the Twitter ecosystem like the firehose partners and investors more, before I draw too many conclusions from the acquisitions Twitter has made. &nbsp;Twitter has already made 6 acuisitions this year, the same amount as Twitter acquired in 2011, and we are only halfway through the year. &nbsp;It makes you&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/03/rumor-twitter-to-acquire-sense-networks-to-target-twitter-ads-locally/">wonder who Twitter's next acquisition will be</a>.</p>

<p>In response, I always step up with <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>.  Twilio is the poster boy of how to do it right.  They just get it.  Ok, we use Twilio a lot, I admit.  After Twilio I tell people to look at <a title="Stripe" href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>.  Another great example of an API centric company, who elegantly solves a problem with a dead simple, but powerful API.</p>
<p><a title="Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/flickr.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>After Twilio and Stripe.  I try to think about some of my favorite APIs from the past, the social pioneers that helped kick things off--APIs like <a title="Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> and <a title="Delicious" href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a>.  Flickr Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake coined the phrase "<a title="Biz Dev 2.0" href="http://apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">Biz Dev 2.0</a>", which was a driving force behind the <a title="Flickr API" href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr API</a> originally.</p>
<p>Ok, Flickr and Delicious are the past, leaving a little to be desired after acquisitions, but another API from the past that really doesn&rsquo;t get much bad API press is <a title="eBay" href="http://developer.ebay.com/common/api/">eBay</a>.  Have you taken a look at the eBay API ecosystem lately?  They have APIs that are there to help make the API ecosystem more efficient.</p>
<p><a title="Amazon Web Services" href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take it one notch further.  One reason I believe in APIs, is my personal experience deploying mission critical infrastructure with <a title="Amazon Web Services" href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS).  Using AWS I deployed web, mail and database services with Amazon EC2 and delivered content ranging from PDF files to streaming video using Amazon S3.  Using AWS I designed and deployed the architecture behind registration and support technology for SAP North America Events and Google events for two years.  AWS plus mission critical events make the perfect opportunity to prove the value of APIs.</p>
<p>My point is, it can be easy bash Twitter, or any other API but let&rsquo;s try and remember that when an API is successful, you probably won&rsquo;t hear much about it, things just work--that is the nature of APIs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">Twitter Continues to Restrict Access to Our Tweets</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/twitter-access.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Twitter has become a global communication platform, allowing anyone in the world to express anything, from simple everyday thoughts, to ideas that some say have the potential to be the seeds of revolution.  Twitter&rsquo;s success was made possible because of open access to Twitter via the web and mobile phones via either SMS or native apps--with a large portion of this access made possible via an open Twitter API.</p>
<p>While the Twitter API is still showcased as an important part of the platform, access via the API is certainly not what it used to be.</p>
<p>While most every feature on Twitter.com is accessible via the API, overall access has been diminished through what is known as &ldquo;rate limiting&rdquo;.  Rate limits began in 2007, to help limit the load on Twitter servers by reducing the number of calls anyone can make in an hour. But over 6 years these rate limits morphed into not just hourly limits, but to restricted access to Twitter increasingly valuable data stores--something that is not at all related to server stability.</p>
<h2>Restricting Access</h2>
<p>As the importance and value of the Twitter data grows, API access limits have become an vital tool for Twitter to tame the Twitter API ecosystem. Twitter has also slowly establish 100% control over web and mobile clients, while also setting the stage for the commoditization of Tweets, creating a new ecosystem where only sanctioned firehose partners are allowed to provide API access.</p>
<p>While the Twitter firehose began as a way to provide wider access to developers, and not as a monetization strategy, it has become just that--a way for Twitter to monetize each and every Tweet, leaving access to Twitter data looking something like this:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" width="100%">

<td style="text-align: center;">Analysis Only<br />No Display</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As rate limits have evolved from hourly limits into overall data limitations, access has shifted to firehose partners. Most recently it has been handed to the two sanctioned firehose partners, slowly reducing access to Twitter&rsquo;s API, and its value to developers.</p>
<h2>Selling Access</h2>
<p>In the past, even with hourly rate limits, developers were able to navigate through a Twitter search or a user&rsquo;s timeline and go back in history without limitations.  However over the past 2-3 years, history has been moved out of reach, by limiting the total volume of Tweets for a search, user timeline and other endpoints, clearing way for a new way to commoditize Twitter history:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #ccc;"><strong>Provider</strong></td>
<td style="background-color: #ccc;"><strong>Timeframe</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #ccc;"><strong>Twitter REST API</strong></td>
<td>1500 total Tweets via search and 3500 total for a user's timeline</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #ccc;"><strong>Twitter Streaming API</strong></td>
<td>Real-time, no historical access</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #ccc;"><strong>Datasift</strong></td>
<td>Back to January 2010</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #ccc;"><strong>Gnip</strong></td>
<td>30 Days with more historical access coming</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Twitter history is now off limits to developers via the Twitter family of APIs, with control relinquished to only two sanctioned partners, who are able to commoditize access to history only for analysis, not for display--leaving the ability to display of Tweets to Twitter. &nbsp;When it comes to history, Twitter has provided access to the Library of Congress, but two years later they are still trying to find the best way to provide access to the archives, without any news of what they have or how they will share this history with the rest of us.</p>
<h2>Marketing "Open"</h2>
<p>Twitter started as a truly open API, openly accessible by the entire ecosystem, and over the last six years Twitter has actively marketed its API as an open ecosystem, encouraging developers to build. This has allowed Twitter to maintain the historical perception that they are an open API platform. In reality, developers who are building actual businesses around Twitter are not just limited, but actively having their access cut-off--leaving Twitter API access to only hobby level projects. &nbsp;If you are looking to build a business on Twitter you need to use one of the Twitter resellers, which means you will have to spend thousands of dollars a month to get data.</p>
<p>Access to Twitter API has been a topic of discussion since they began rate limiting in 2007, but rate limits were not actively used to control what developers could build until 2010, when Twitter began its quest for monetization.  This quest has involved controlling every Twitter endpoint as well as the brand, something that has historically involved developers.</p>
<h2>Control</h2>
<p>As a API owner I understand Twitter&rsquo;s need to maintain control over their brand and platform, but I feel their approach has severely damaged the entire open API movement. Twitter has actively maintained the legacy image of Twitter as an open API platform, encouraging developers to build, while quietly reducing access, stifling innovation around what is the most important global communication and API platforms in the world--a process which doesn't just destroy their ecosystem, but has damaged developer's taste for building with open APIs.</p>
<p>Analyzing the last six years of Twitter's history, it's very clear that Twitter does not have the respect for the ecosystem that has significantly contributed to the company's success. Beginning in 2010 Twitter saw developers as an obstacle to their goals for extracting value from the passionate user base, and monetizing the increasingly valuable stream of Tweets, that we generate on a daily basis, around the globe. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Twitter wraps itself in the rhetoric of free speech, but has done nothing but restrict the voice of the developer and everyone's access to our Tweets.</p>

After some driving around California this week, I&rsquo;ve had time to ponder three recent episodes with <a title="Netflix" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/28/putting-the-changes-to-the-netflix-public-api-in-perspective/">Netflix</a>, <a title="LinkedIn" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/28/lack-of-linkedin-communication-about-pealk-leaves-us-thinking-the-worst/">LinkedIn</a> and <a title="Craigslist" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/28/cmon-craiglist-launch-an-api-already/">Craigslist</a>.

<p>I thought about his Tweet for the last week and he&rsquo;s right.  While it&rsquo;s easy to run and get our pitchforks in these situations and demonize API owners, or bitch about how much API developers suck, this all is just the beginning of something greater--the API economy.</p>
<p>Trade wars are an active part of our global economy, and with the growth in the number of APIs, the tension between API owners and consumers is only going to grow.  We can&rsquo;t see them as black or white, we will have to evaluate them on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>I think my three posts tonight reflect the potential diversity in issues.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Netflix" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/28/putting-the-changes-to-the-netflix-public-api-in-perspective/">Netflix</a></strong> - The movie industry isn&rsquo;t quite ready for public APIs, other change required first, sorry developers</li>

<li><strong><a title="Craigslist" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/28/cmon-craiglist-launch-an-api-already/">Craigslist</a></strong> - Sometimes the market just demands that you need an API, allowing you to tame scrapers</li>
</ul>
<p>James Watters Tweet definitely made me look at this issues in a different light.  And that is what I love about this space, it is constantly changing, forcing me to constantly reevaluate how I see things and tell stories in the space.  And even before I can finish this post John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) has got me thinking about another angle all three of these stories share:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>After looking at over 6000 APIs, the most irritating thing for me when reviewing an API, is when I have to work to figure out what an API does. &nbsp;Many APIs just don't communicate what their API does and articulate the value for developers.</p>
<p>Every API should have a quick introductory paragraph at the top of the first page that clearly defines the API in 250 words or less.   Many APIs have a description, but it often reads like this:</p>
<blockquote><em>The [Insert Company Name Here] API delivers programmatic access to all the features available in the [Insert Company Name Here] web application.  Developers can use the API to build web and mobile applications using the functionality it provides.</em></blockquote>
<p>Ok?  You just told me nothing.  I have no idea what your core web application does, or your API.  The second worse offense I see API owners commit, is they get all RESTful on you:</p>
<blockquote><em>The [Insert Company Name Here] API delivers RESTful access to the features available in the [Insert Company Name Here] web application.  Using the API you can construct URLs and GET or POST information to the API and receive either XML or JSON responses.</em></blockquote>
<p>Ok?  You just told me nothing.  You gave me a brief introduction to REST.  Not very helpful.  Often times I have to go to the parent website to figure out what a company does, before I understand the value of an API.</p>
<p>As an API owner, make sure and provide a quick, concise description of your API and the value it delivers.  Don&rsquo;t assume developers are in your head or understand what your company does.  When writing your description, give it to someone who knows nothing about your company and see if they can figure out what it does.</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have to work to understand what your API does.  Describe the value to me, quickly make me understand how it will help me, so I have the motivation to move past your main page, dive into your documentation and begin integrating.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve had a couple of new API ecosystem flare ups in the last week.  one from <a title="LinkedIn" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/06/21/linkedin-shuts-down-headhunting-app-how-open-is-open/">LinkedIn</a> and the other from <a title="Netflix" href="http://goodfil.ms/blog/posts/2012/06/18/netflix-quietly-smothers-3rd-party-app-ecosystem/">Netflix</a>.  I&rsquo;m still working on my thoughts about both of these, but in the meantime I can't help but think about the tension between API owners and their consumers.  This tension doesn&rsquo;t exist in all ecosystems, but seems default by nature in others.</p>
<p>In these flare ups, I can&rsquo;t help but empathize with both sides and see each others perspective:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Owners -</strong> This is my company, our resources and our brand.  I may &ldquo;eat our own dog food&rdquo; to show I share your pain, but I really don&rsquo;t understand the developer perspective because I don&rsquo;t use other people&rsquo;s APIs, let alone depend on them for my business livelihood.  I appreciate the work that&rsquo;s going on within the ecosystem, but I also have to keep my bosses happy and maintain relationships with our partners and vendors.</li>
<li><strong>API Consumers -</strong> It&rsquo;s hard when I can&rsquo;t figure out an API or find the right info that will make it easier for me to on-board.  It&rsquo;s even harder when there is nobody to respond to my questions.  It really frustrates me when I can&rsquo;t get the access I need to be successful, even when I&rsquo;m willing to pay. It&rsquo;s even worse when I spend tens or hundreds of hours on a project or startup idea only to see you build it or even worse cut off my access because you feel threatened by me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both sides of the ecosystem can get along, you see it happen with APIs like Twilio, Stripe and even Amazon Web Services. There will be problems within ecosystem, but not all APIs are looking to screw over developers and not all developers are looking to exploit APIs.</p>
<p>I think in the beginning it can be fairly easy to maintain order in an API area, but as it evolves and the community of consumers grows, it can be difficult to find balance and maintain perfect alignment between the owners and consumers goals.  But I think through the right amount of transparency and communication, both sides can find the right balance.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15p;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/wso2/WSO2-API-Manager-Logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>This is a much quicker follow-up to last week&rsquo;s post, <a title="Where Is The Open Source API Platform" href="/2012/06/11/where-is-the-open-source-api-platform/">Where Is The Open Source API Platform</a>, than I anticipated.  I just finished a demo of <a href="http://wso2.com/products/api-manager">WSO2 API Manager</a>, a completely open-source API management platform.</p>
<p>I got quite a few emails and DM&rsquo;s from folks after that post, and while there are other open-source API offerings like <a title="API Axle" href="http://apiaxle.com/">API Axle</a> and <a title="Cumula" href="http://cumula.org/">Cumula</a> (which I will write about separately), I was looking for a full platform tool, and it appears WSO2 is what I was looking for.</p>
<p>WSO2 API Manager is a simple, easy to understand API platform, but has all the hardened enterprise goodness many of you will be looking for when it comes to security, governance, policy enforcement, etc.</p>
<p>The platform is broken into three main buckets:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<p><img style="padding: 15p;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/wso2/WSO2-API-Manager-Screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<li><strong>API Gateway -</strong> To secure, protect, manage, and scale API calls</li>
<li><strong>API Publisher -</strong> Enables API providers to easily publish their APIs, share documentation, provision API keys, and gather feedback on APIs features, quality and usage</li>
<li><strong>API Store - </strong>Provides a space for consumers to discover APIs functionality, test APIs online, subscribe to APIs, evaluate them and interact with API publishers</li>
</ul>
<p>They break the API users into what I think are important target segments:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Creator -</strong> The technical owner of an API</li>
<li><strong>API Publisher -</strong> The business owner of an API</li>
<li><strong>API Consumer -</strong> The developer or consumer of an API</li>
</ul>
<p>I really like this distinction, because it acknowledges that many APIs are not born out of technical departments, and allows for duel ownership of any API from the technical and business disciplines-- which is very important to the success of an API.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15p;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/wso2/WSO2-API-Manager-Screenshot-3.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></p>
<p>WSO2 API Manager meets my vision because its a platform that has the identity, proxy and other essential technical pieces, but provides an extensible platform to deliver the other building blocks for a successful API like documentation, code samples, how-tos, forums, etc.</p>
<p>WSO2 has a target of end of July for the version 1.0 release, as well as an aggressive roadmap for adding other features for billing, etc.  I&rsquo;m going to download the current version and start playing with to get more familiar with, and hopefully be able to provide a more detailed review of the open-source API management platform.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too early to tell, but WSO2 looks to be the necessary open-source counter balance I was looking for, and the fact that it&rsquo;s already in development shows me that the API space is even more healthier than even I anticipated.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/nursing-health-survival-guides-api/apimethod/get-article/189/overview" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/pearson/pearson-nursing-guide.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=103">Last May, Pearson Publishing began the roll-out of their new API platform</a>, by doing initial tests using their DK&rsquo;s Eyewitness Travel Guide material, before moving on to a wider range of subjects.  By the <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/08/16/re-inventing-pearson-publishing-using-apis/">end of the summer they had rolled out</a> a total of three APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/eyewitness-guides/apimethod/entries-guide/189/overview" target="_blank">Eyewitness Guides</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/ft-press/apimethod/get-book-block/189/overview" target="_blank">FT Press</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/longman-dictionary/apimethod/get-entry-0/189/overview" target="_blank">Longman Dictionary</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A year later, they now have APIs for the <a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/pearson-kitchen-manager/apimethod/courses/190/overview" target="_blank">Pearson Kitchen Manager</a> and most recently the <a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/nursing-health-survival-guides-api/apimethod/get-article/189/overview" target="_blank">Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guides API</a>.</p>
<p>Pearson is obviously being very cautious with their precious business assets. Taking time to do it right when bundling up these resources and making available for developers via a RESTful interface.</p>
<p>The Pearson Developers community has many of the <a title="essential API building blocks" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">essential API building blocks</a> like documentation, blog, forum, and FAQ. <a title="Registration for Pearson APIs" href="http://developer.pearson.com/user">Registration for Pearson APIs</a> is self-service, allowing me to immediately verify my email, login and begin exploring the APIs.</p>
<p>For support, Pearson provides a contact form while also <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/pearsonapi">maintaing an active presence on Twitter</a>, and even provides a "report a bug" feature for each API. &nbsp;The terms of of use for Pearson APIs is pretty liberal, allowing to me use their content in my commercial applications, even if I use advertising.</p>
<p>Pearson has a done well in opening up their content with APIs.  They&rsquo;ve done it wisely, requiring registration so they can track how its used, but keeping registration self-service and providing sensible terms of use, so they are protected, but also giving developers enough freedom so they can get to building apps and innovating around their content.</p>
<p>It makes sense for Pearson to take it slowly and learn with each API implementation, making sure they do it right.  I think Pearson&rsquo;s simplistic approach to opening up their catalog is a great example for other publishers to follow.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Jun 2012</span>
        <p>Its been over six months since I did my <a title="roundup of 11 API service providers on ProgrammableWeb" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/10/19/api-service-provider-roundup/">roundup of 11 API service providers on ProgrammableWeb</a>. &nbsp;I've been seeing enough new entries into the space, I think its time to do another roundup, providing a single list of API service providers for you to explore.</p>
<p>I will start with I called the grandfathers of the space. &nbsp;The ones who were doing it before APIs became all cool.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.soa.com/atmosphere"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/atmosphere-logo-1.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://www.soa.com/atmosphere">Atmosphere</a></strong>&nbsp;- The SOA Software, Atmosphere&trade; provides a secure, robust platform that companies can use to share their APIs with the developer community of their choice.

</blockquote>
<p>After my post in October of 2011, two other providers came out of the woodwork and said, "Hey! what about us? &nbsp;We've been doing this a while too!" &nbsp;So I have to include them this time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/REST-Web-Services-API-Security/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/intel_logo_500.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/REST-Web-Services-API-Security/">Intel</a></strong>&nbsp;- Intel&reg; Expressway Service Gateway provides an enforcement point for REST web services messages and can delegate authentication and authorization to identity management and PKI systems such as Active Directory and CA* Siteminder.

</blockquote>
<p>Then there are the three major players in API management, that have been dominating the current landscape:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.3scale.net/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="190" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a></strong>&nbsp;- 3scale provides an Out-of-the-Box Cloud API management Platform &amp; Infrastructure for developers, and companies to securely open, control, manage, operate and monetize their API to 3rd parties (e.g. developers, business partners, etc). 3scale API management platform is Plug and Play, configurable, flexible and scalable and brings API providers an unparalleled level of ownership, control and configuration to ensure QoS, SLA and a great user experience.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I left one provider out of my last service provider round-up, which is ironic, since the post was on <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a>, which is owned by Alcatel-Lucent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/open-api-platform/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/alcatel-lucent-logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/open-api-platform/">Alcatel-Lucent</a></strong>&nbsp;- The Alcatel-Lucent Open API Platform (OAP) is an API Monetization and Optimization software solution, for Service Providers to turn their data and telecommunication infrastructure into a commercial transaction platform.

</blockquote>
<p>Next there are several companies focused on APIs for your data. &nbsp;Last year I included <a title="InfoChimps" href="http://www.infochimps.com/">InfoChimps</a>, which has pivoted since then and is more a big data platform now. &nbsp;I'm going to go ahead and bundle Socrata in with the remaning data API providers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://kasabi.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/Kasabi-Logo.png" alt="" width="130" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://kasabi.com/">Kasabi</a></strong>&nbsp;- Kasabi is a marketplace for people publishing and looking for data.

<p>During the last post I had showcased two new players in the space:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.mashape.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/mashape-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a></strong>&nbsp;- Mashape provides tools that enable developers to quickly deliver and consume APIs and offers a marketplace for listing APIs.

<p><a href="http://apiary.io/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/apiary-io-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a>&nbsp;</strong>- Apiary.io provides developers with a way to describe APIs using whats called an API Blueprint-a custom language that allows you to rapidly describe you API in a way that you can collaborate/version/merge as you're used to when coding. From this blueprint Apiary.io then generate API documentation, a debugging proxy and bug reports. Apiary.io also provides social and technical integration using Github, to integrate with where you are already deploying your code and collaborating with developers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Apiary.io was still in early beta, Mashape was open for business and is now out of beta. Now, in the first six months of 2012 I've tracked on seven new players in the space:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://apiaxle.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/api-axle-logo.png" alt="" width="75" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://apiaxle.com/">API Axle</a></strong>&nbsp;- Apiaxle is a free, locally hosted API proxy that can sit infront of your API, providing key authentication, rate limiting and statics.

</blockquote>
<p>That brings a total of API service providers to 20. &nbsp;There are other providers that deliver services API owners can use, but the companies I've included are focusing specifically on providing services to API owners, and a growing focus on delivering services just for developers.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/webshell-logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm in talks with several other new providers as well, who aren't quite ready at the time of this post. &nbsp;One such company is&nbsp;<a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/home">Webshell</a>, who is developing a scripting language designed for fast API consumption and implementation. After a demo I think Webshell could open up new ways for us to consume, not just single APIs, but many APIs mashed up together creating entirely new API interfaces and interactions.</p>
<p>Any way you look at there is serious API innovation going on in 2012, its an exciting area to be part of. &nbsp;If you know of any API service providers I missed, make sure and drop me a line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had some amazing feedback on my post about&nbsp;<a title="the demand for API and developer evangelists" href="/2012/06/11/the-demand-for-api-and-developer-evangelists/">the demand for API and developer evangelists</a>.  One great perspective was from the team over at <a title="Iron.io" href="http://www.iron.io/">Iron.io</a>, who do cloud messaging, event handling, workers, scheduling and provide a key/value data caching.</p>
<p>Ironi.io&rsquo;s has a unique company philosophy that addresses the need hire an API or developer evangelist.  Their approach is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in an API-driven company everybody is an API and developer evangelist</span>.   Iron.io has their entire team monitoring their public chat, which has lead to everyone in the company understanding customer pain points as well as hearing the praise and positive feedback from the community.</p>
<p><a title="Iron.io" href="http://www.iron.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/ironio/banner-scale-robot.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>While it sounds simple, spreading core philosophies like this company-wide can have a transformative power.  Think of <a title="Amazon&rsquo;s success after Jeff Bezos mandated" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">Amazon&rsquo;s success after Jeff Bezos mandated</a> that, "All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces."</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s the little things that can provide huge shifts in how we think.  A cornerstone of my API Evangelism philosophy is internal evangelism within a company about the power of APIs, in addition to public and partner evangelism.  Iron.io&rsquo;s philosophy changes this for me.</p>
<p>I know that not all companies can make the shift to API-driven companies, but if an entire company can adopt an API-centric frame of mind and share the evangelism role across the company, there is no need for a single API or developer evangelist.</p>
<p>Maybe API evangelist is more of a philosophy than an actual role your company needs to fill?</p>

<p>Every couple weeks I get posts that really strike a chord with my audience, like <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">Barack Obama Directs All Federal Agencies to Have an API</a>, which has received 40K+ page views and 1000+ tweets.  When it comes to sustained traffic numbers, two posts seem to really bring in eyeballs each and every week via organic searches:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Open Building Blocks for an API" href="/2011/04/04/open-building-blocks-for-an-api/">Open Building Blocks for an API</a></li>
<li><a title="Open Source API Billing and Traffic Control" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/open-source-api-billing-and-traffic-control/">Open Source API Billing and Traffic Control</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These posts are successful, not because of searches driven from a couple of hours on the home page of Reddit or Hacker News, these get page views because users are searching for open source API tools on the open Internet.  Seeing these sustained numbers validates for me the need for an fully open-source set of tools for API deployment and management.</p>
<p>While the top <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/">API management service providers</a> like 3Scale, Apigee, Layer7, Mashery and SOA Software are enjoying growth in API adoption, to <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/06/05/reaching-a-million-apis-and-what-to-do-when-we-get-there/">reach a million APIs and a truly healthy API industry</a>, we need a solid open-source API platform that provides:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>RESTful Framework for Deployment and Management</li>
<li>API Analytics and Metering</li>
<li>API Service and Billing Management</li>
<li>Ecosystem Building Blocks Like Documentation, Code Samples, etc.</li>
<li>Discovery</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Console-1.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></p>
<p>I know there are individual tools that deliver in some of these area, and this is what I am working to bring together via the <a title="API Evangelist Tools" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/apitools/">API Evangelist tools</a> section.  But we need a full suite of tools that API owners can deploy from start to finish, and service providers can benefit from as well as contribute to--something in PHP, Python, Ruby and / or Java.</p>
<p>While looking through thousands of APIs I notice that many of them go silent about 6 months after launch, which tells me many of them spent their resources on development, deployment and initial management--not leaving resources for properly handling the business of their APIs, allowing them to evolve, pivot and find success.</p>
<p>To get the API industry where we need it, we need thousands of more companies jumping in.  Many of these companies won&rsquo;t be able to afford the services of Apigee, Layer7, Mashery and SOA, and with 3Scale and Mashape being the only entry level API management platform(there are others emerging), there is a huge need for an entry-level, open source API offering.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m one of the only vendor neutral players in the space, I&rsquo;d love to solicit some partners to help make this happen.  Even if version 1.0 involves bundling of existing open-source tools, I&rsquo;d like to kickstart a truly open-source movement for the API space.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> &nbsp;Shortly after posting this I was introduced to the new <a title="WSO2 Open Source API Management Platform" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/19/the-100-open-source-api-platform-i-was-looking-for/">WSO2 Open Source API Management Platform</a>.</p>

<p>I just got off the phone with a recruiter of a major API management company, looking to recruit me as a developer evangelist, and last week I talked with two companies looking for developer evangelists.</p>
<p>My profile comes up in a lot of searches on Google, LinkedIn , and with the growing number of APIs, the number of companies looking to fill the role, grows as well. It makes sense that I come up in searches and get a regular stream of calls.</p>
<p>Most recruiters I decline, as I&rsquo;m looking to pay attention to the bigger picture, beyond just a single API--and tell them I will put out a signal to my network, about the role.  I do this knowing, there really is nobody to fill the role.</p>
<p>The recruiter today asked an interesting question.  If you're not available, what type of person should I be looking for?  In my mind, an evangelist should be equal parts:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Engineer</li>
<li>Product Development</li>
<li>Business Development</li>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you can find anyone coming from one of those disciplines, but has the technical chops and isn&rsquo;t afraid of programming-I recommend starting with whichever of those skillsets is most important to you.</p>
<p>Ideally you want to find someone who has been programming for years, but recently has been a lead developer or architect, and has upper management experience as well as understands the business and customer end of operations.</p>
<p>If you fit the profile of an API or developer evangelist, or are just curious about the role, drop me a line I&rsquo;d like to talk more, there is potentially a huge demand out there for your skills.</p>

<p>I have a workflow for dealing with the steady stream of ideas that fly out of my arse on a daily basis.  First, I write them all down in Evernote.  If an idea sticks with me and keeps nagging on me in the back of my mind, I usually give it a place on the internal wiki that I use for managing my world.  Then if an idea sits on the wiki for over a year and I haven&rsquo;t finished building it, and successfully deployed or integrated into my platform--I set it free.</p>
<p>The one year expiration date has come for one of my ideas, and I want to publish here so maybe someone else will run with it.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Project Idea:</strong> RESTGit</li>
<li><strong>Summary:</strong> A RESTful interface for any public or private Github repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>I just want a quick way of throwing up a RESTful front, with or without authentication using <a title="3Scale API management" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale API management</a>. RESTGit would deploy any flavor of language I choose: PHP, Python, Ruby, Java or anything else.</p>
<p>This way I could take select code resources I possess, commit them to a Github repository--then point RESTGit at the repository, and it would generate a REST framework and allow me to customize and adjust as needed.</p>
<p>RESTGit would be open source of course.  It could be deployed as an Amazon EC2 instance, letting me rapidly deliver APIs for any resources I posses and scale as needed using AWS.</p>
<p>I wish I had more time to invest in my side projects, but I&rsquo;d rather see it implemented.  Hopefully one of you readers will find the time to develop RESTGit and open source it for everyone to use.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/06/06/brand-control-within-an-api-ecosystem-twitter-edition/">Brand Control Within An API Ecosystem: Twitter Edition</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">06 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/twitter-bird-blue-on-white.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Right after security, controlling your brand is the biggest concern I get from companies interested in deploying APIs.  They are worried about being able to control their brand and overall message portrayed by their potential developer community.</p>
<p>Branding guidelines and a robust image, button and UI gallery is something I encourage API owners to invest in from day one, because it&rsquo;s easier to set the stage early on than trying to take control after the unicorns are running wild.</p>
<p>One example of this is the darling of the API industry, Twitter.  <a title="Twitter has took further control of their brand today, with the release of #Twitterbird" href="http://blog.twitter.com/2010/10/new-twitter-new-look.html">Twitter has took further control of their brand today, with the release of #Twitterbird</a>.  As Twitter states:</p>
<blockquote><em>Starting today you&rsquo;ll begin to notice a simplified Twitter bird. From now on, this bird will be the universally recognizable symbol of Twitter. (Twitter is the bird, the bird is Twitter.) There&rsquo;s no longer a need for text, bubbled typefaces, or a lowercase &ldquo;t&rdquo; to represent Twitter.</em></blockquote>
<p>The <a title="#TwitterBird" href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23TwitterBird">#TwitterBird</a> is the latest addition to the <a href="https://twitter.com/about/logos">Twitter Trademark and Content Display Policy</a>, where Twitter lays down the following branding guidelines for the Twitter ecosystem:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Assortment of Twitter approved images</li>
<li>Dos and Don'ts of using Twitter images</li>
<li>How to use buttons to promote your Twitter account</li>
<li>Use of Twitter brand in advertising and marketing materials</li>
<li>Use of Twitter brand in merchandise and manufactured items</li>
<li>Naming your applications, products and domains</li>
<li>How to visually design your website</li>
<li>What to do when your writing a book or publication about Twitter</li>
<li>How to display Tweets and other Twitter content</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/Twitter-Branding-Old-1.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come a long ways from <a title="2008" href="http://www.twitip.com/181-twitter-buttons-badges-widget-and-counters-to-help-you-find-followers/">2008</a> and <a title="2009" href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/100-remarkably-beautiful-twitter-icons-and-buttons/">2009</a> where logos, buttons, badges and other Twitter branding items were yet another area where Twitter depended on the Twitter ecosystem for support.  The Twitter community created a wild assortment of assets to be used when integrating Twitter into your site or application.</p>
<p>Then <a title="starting in 2010 Twitter started pulling in the reigns and took more control of their brand" href="http://blog.twitter.com/2010/10/new-twitter-new-look.html">starting in 2010 Twitter started pulling in the reigns and took more control of their brand</a> with the release of a set of &ldquo;refreshed...logos, buttons and widgets to bring the improved look and experience of the new Twitter to your website or blog&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Over the next two years Twitter has continued to polish their brand, while also tightening the rules of how you can use Twitter and Tweets in your own sites and applications.   While I totally understand Twitter&rsquo;s need to get more control, my only criticism are:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/Twitter-Branding-Old-2-2.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Four Years Late</strong> - They should have done this a long time ago.  It took four years before they started doing anything in branding.</li>
<li><strong>Developers</strong> - They should have included the ecosystem in more of the planning as well as creating a layer that includes ecosystem apps in the equation</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for me to sit here in the future, telling Twitter what they should have done, when they were the pioneering API company.  But I feel pretty strongly that many of the decisions in the last two years to gain control of their ecosystem, would have been better off started from the beginning, and also suffers from a severe shortage of ecosystem involvement.</p>
<p>While I can&rsquo;t change Twitter&rsquo;s approach to the Business of their APIs, I can help influence the next generation of APIs.  Make sure you consider a healthy and complete branding resource center for your API, and consider how you can protect your brand while also empowering your developer ecosystem.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.kinvey.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mobile-backend-as-a-service/kinvey/kinvey-logo-300.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Mobile is fueling a lot of API growth right now.   Or is it APIs fueling a lot of Mobile growth right now?  Either way, APIs and Mobile go together like chocolate and peanut butter (or Nutella as my girlfriend would say).</p>
<p>With this growth in mobile, we are seeing a rise of Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers, delivering a basic stack of storage, messaging, notifications, user management and other essential components for mobile developers.</p>
<p>The goal of MBaaS providers is to make it very easy for developers to setup and operate a backend for any application.  After delivering the essentials like storage, messaging access, push notifications, etc., it makes sense that now developers will need easier integration with the data and resources available in web APIs.</p>
<p>MBaaS provider <a title="Kinvey" href="http://www.kinvey.com/">Kinvey</a> is doing just that.  Using <a title="ql.io" href="http://www.ebaytechblog.com/2011/11/30/announcing-ql-io/">ql.io</a>, a declarative, evented, data-retrieval and aggregation gateway for HTTP APIs, they are bringing web APIs to developers, like GeoPlaces data using Google Places, product data from Ebay&rsquo;s Product API and social data using Twitter.</p>
<p><a href="http://ql.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-tools/qlio-logo-300.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Kinvey is baking in the most popular and valuable web APIs right into the Kinvey SDK, making data from APIs as easy to access, as data in your local Kinvey data store.  Kinvey will deliver an abstracted layer on top of each API, storing data into tables, making them accessible using common queries like SELECT, FROM and WHERE.  They will even let you do JOINS on multiple data sources, allowing you to mashup and improve API data performance.</p>
<p>Kinvey will take on the heavy lifting associated with the differences between APIs and maintain access between different API versions.  I&rsquo;m assuming with the amount of work involved, Kinvey will be only delivering the most valuable of web APIs or at least the most stable.</p>
<p>Sounds like API owners need to start building relationships with Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers, as this might be the doorway to the next round of growth in your API adoption.  Especially if MBaaS providers can truly make APIs a more local, native experience for mobile developers.</p>

The President has given federal agencies 90 days to create a page on its website, located at www.[agency].gov/digitalstrategy, to publicly report progress in meeting the requirements of the Strategy in a machine-readable format, and implement the requirements of the Strategy within 12 months.</p>
<p>As I said in my post, I wanted to setup a <a title="page to monitor this activity" href="/federal_government.php">page to monitor this activity</a>.  I found a <a href="https://explore.data.gov/Federal-Government-Finances-and-Employment/Federal-Executive-Branch-Internet-Domains/k9h8-e98h">dataset of federal executive branch Internet domains</a>, thanks to Anthony Sutardja, one of my readers. In the dataset there are 1467 domains, with 106 distinct agencies running those domains.  The President states "executive department and agencies" in his directive. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t imagine we are going to see digital strategies in 90 days for all 1467 domains?  I&rsquo;m assuming it will occur within the top level agencies first.  But I&rsquo;m very curious see which agency domains follow, so I&rsquo;m going to leave all of them up.</p>
<p>I created a script that will poll www.[agency].gov/digitalstrategy for each agency.  I will run this every night this year.  The script checks the HTTP status code for the page, records it with a time stamp, and the we&rsquo;ll see who returns HTTP status code 200(OK) first.  Quick note:  It&rsquo;s interesting to see which agency doesn&rsquo;t properly use status codes, but that is another issue.</p>
<p>Anyone want to wager on who is first, and how many of the 1467 meet the requirements for posting their strategy and ultimately implementing APIs?  Personally I&rsquo;m hoping for CIA and the NSF.  Think of the mashups you could make!!!</p>
<p>I all seriousness, this is extremely important.  If agencies meet these requirements, we can see a radically different federal government in the coming years.  As one of my readers and friend said on the post yesterday, "It looks like the Jeff Bezos mandate that he did 10 years ago!". If you don&rsquo;t known what I&rsquo;m talking about, read "<a title="The Secret to Amazons Success, APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">The Secret to Amazons Success Internal APIs</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You can visit the <a title="Federal Agency API Deployment Tracker" href="/federal_government.php">Federal Agency API Deployment Tracker</a> page for more detail, I will keep the link prominent in the right hand feature area of this site, for the rest of the year.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/federal-government/Building-a-21st-century-platform-to-better-serve-the-american-people-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I wanted to publish some thoughts, on what Federal Agencies responding to the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-02/pdf/2011-10732.pdf">Executive Order 13571</a> issued on April 27, 2011, and the White House CIO&rsquo;s, "<a title="Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People</a>" strategy should be considering.</p>
<p>These thoughts are in the business and marketing aspects web API deployment, with light thoughts in the technical areas.  My speciality is not with technical deployment of APIs, I recommend agency leaders visit <a title="API-Craft" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/api-craft">API-Craft</a>, an industry forum with some seriously smart API industry leaders discussing the finer, technical points of web API deployment.</p>
<p>Where I would like to share some thoughts is in the business of deploying and managing Federal Agency APIs.  Insights evolved over 20+ years in the technology field, but exclusively spending the last 2 years studying the business of popular APIs like Twitter and Facebook, and larger API providers like Google and Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sharing my thoughts, not to benefit any company, but because I strongly believe in the transformative powers of Web APIs.   Web APIs have the power to change the way our Government operates both internally, and with the public.  Barack Obama&rsquo;s mandate, &ldquo;requiring agencies to establish central online resources for outside developers and to adopt new standards for making applicable Government information open and machine-readable by default&rdquo;, marks an important point in history.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t screw this up!</p>
<p>While much of the discussion around this announcement on <a title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.apievangelist.com%2F2012%2F06%2F01%2Fbarak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api%2F">Twitter</a>, <a title="Reddit" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ughx0/barack_obama_directs_all_federal_agencies_to_have/">Reddit</a> and <a title="Hacker News" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4056310">Hacker News</a> is positive, there is a lot of skepticism around whether the government can succeed.  With this post, I wanted to share some thoughts on the essential building blocks we&rsquo;ll need to make this work.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Building Blocks<br /></strong>I will only speak lightly on essential technical building blocks that need go into Federal Agencies Web APIs, but there are a couple I consider essential:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Access</strong> - Idenitying proper access levels for web APIs, leaving open when possible, requiring keys when needed and implementing oAuth when it makes sense give users control over which applications access their data</li>
<li><strong>REST</strong> - The dominant approach to deploying web APIs, building on top of the existing structure of the World Wide Web.  REST has proven to robust enough for most any web API while keeping it simple and intuitive for access by a  wide audience</li>
<li><strong>JSON</strong> - I&rsquo;m not advocating for getting rid of XML, but JSON is the accepted standard for API communication.  JSON needs to be adopted as the default for federal agency web APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>There are plenty of other technical considerations, but I&rsquo;ll leave that for other experts to deliver on. &nbsp;Next lets get users, onboarded and using each agencies APis.</p>
<p><strong>User Onboarding<br /></strong>There are a lot of challenges for the average web API developer faces when trying to integrate, initial onboarding has to be quick and painless.  There are a couple of essential building blocks that assists in user onboarding:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Landing Page </strong>- A single landing page for everyone to access federal agency APIs, providing single click access to everything you need to get up and running with the API</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service </strong>- API access needs to be self-service, enabling anyone to discover and integrate 24 / 7 without assistance from any agency staff</li>
<li><strong>Account Management - </strong>Allow users to quickly register using common single sign-on using my Twitter, Facebook or Google accounts, and provide users with easy to understand account, key, application and API usage management tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Next for a developer to successfully go from onboarding to, API integration, it will require an essential set of resource building blocks providing everything they need to understand the API interface, and begin using:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Authentication </strong>- Give users a quick introduction to API access including which endpoints are open, keyed or require oAuth for usage.  Also provide links to support technical information about authentication</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Provide simple, complete and up to date documentation for every Web API endpoint. &nbsp;Also consider deploying interactive, smart documention using a technology like Swagger</li>
<li><strong>Code Samples</strong> - Provide sample code for each API endpoint in all the common languages including PHP, Python, Ruby, .NET, Perl, Java, Objective-C, all provided as Github repositories</li>
<li><strong>Starter Kits -</strong> Provide as many ready to code sample applications and starter kits to show developers what is possible, all provided as Github repositories</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - Provide mobile specific code samples, SDKs and other resources supporting mobile specific development</li>
</ul>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve provided the essential technical, onboarding and resource building blocks, you need to make sure your your agencies API area has the necessary communication building blocks, allowing you to effectively communicate with users about your API, but also give your users a voice in API operations:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - A blog is an essential communication tool in API ecosystems.  Make sure the blog is active, and provides an RSS feed</li>
<li><strong>Forum</strong> - A forum will provide a platform for you to communicate back and forth with API users, providing a rich knowledge for future users, and also opening up the possibility of users helping other users</li>
<li><strong>FAQ</strong> - Provide a simple, realistic and complete list of the most frequently asked questions.  Also keep it a living list, truly reflecting which questions get asked every month</li>
<li><strong>Contact</strong> - Establish some way users can directly contact the agency for support</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - An active Twitter account is a required communication tool</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> - A presence on the top business social network is important</li>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> - An active page on Facebook helps with communication</li>
<li><strong>Google+</strong> - Google's social network can help with developer interaction</li>
</ul>
<p>With proper communication building blocks in place, next make sure and address the legal considerations around the web API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Terms of Use </strong>- Clearly let users know what is expected when they access the agencies web APIs</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Establish clear privacy policies for all people and companies involved</li>
<li><strong>Licensing</strong> - Provide data, API interface and code licensing for everyone to see</li>
</ul>
<p>With legal expectations set, make sure and think about branding for the agency.  While these web APIs are the federal government, for them to be successful, the word needs to get out that our government does such a find job making data available.  There are some common API branding building blocks emerging to accomplish this:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Branding Requirements</strong> - Establish a base understanding of how to properly attribute the agency in compliance with overall usage requirements</li>
<li><strong>Logo</strong> - Provide a single place to find a selection of approved graphical logos and HTML or JavaScript code snippets users can use when adhering to branding requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>After baking in some user implemented marketing for the agency, with API branding, make sure and provide some operational building blocks that help API users understand what is going on with the agencies APIs and where they are going:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Roadmap</strong> - Give users a clear roadmap of where the agency is going with it&rsquo;s digital strategy, providing insight as far in the future as possible</li>
<li><strong>Changelog</strong> - Provide a real-time list of changes made to the API and its supporting building blocks</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing real-time communication on your API operations is important to establishing trust with developers.  If you just make it part of your daily operations, it isn't that much more work.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Developers</strong><br />While planning the digital strategy for your agencies web API make sure and consider non-developers.  One reason for the success of web APIs is that it uses REST, which uses the technology driving the existing World Wide Web, making RESTful APIs potentially familiar to non-developers.  With the right building blocks, web APIs become accessible to a wide variety of users:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong> - Buttons, widgets and badges that are provided on top of a web API provide a copy and paste method for non-developers to quicky make use of the data and information available via an API</li>
<li><strong>Media</strong> - Provide a section dedicated to media, helping media on two fronts 1) to understand what an API does in plain english 2)  to put a web API to potential use in their data journalism efforts</li>
<li><strong>Educational</strong> - Provide information and resources that facilitates API usage by any level of academic research and projects</li>
<li><strong>Platforms&nbsp;</strong> - With introduction of Google Docs, Google Big Query and other big data processing solutions, the opportunity for API integration on these platforms is growing.  Provide templates for using agency APIs within these platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything suggested up until now, truly supports a digital approach, to each agencies digital strategy, but in these environments, the need for face to face and human interaction can be critical to building understanding, awareness and ultimatley a community around a web API.</p>
<p><strong>Events</strong><br />Events are a great way to build awareness around an API, there are several common event building blocks that are used in the industry:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Annual Conference</strong> - Establish an annual event where each API stake holder and any user can rub elbows and share their thoughts about web APIs</li>
<li><strong>Road Show -</strong> Develop a road show that goes from city-to-city, providing a town hall format for understanding each agencies digital strategy</li>
<li><strong>Meetups</strong> - Attend existing developer meetups and gathers that are already occuring in cities around the country</li>
<li><strong>Hackathons</strong> - Sponsors, attend and put on hackathons that encourage hacking around federal agency APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that represents my thoughts on the essential API building blocks federal agencies should consider while formulating their digital strategy.  The only other area I would offer more details on, is around API evangelism and developer advocacy.  Who will be in charge of getting the word out about an API?  Will this be a single person or shared responsibility?  An API Evanglism strategy is critical to the success of an API, but I think I will cover that in another post.</p>
<p>Scrolling back up the page, this seems like a lot, and potentially counter to my wishes that we start simple and make sure this is a success.  My goal with these thoughts is to provide a potential business framework that could be adopted across all agency deployments.</p>
<p>These building blocks are derived from reviewing the API operations of hundreds of existing public APIs, including industry heavyweights like Google and Amazon.   While some APIs like Twitter deal with API management at massive scale, Google and Amazon provide models for managing large numbers of web APIs.</p>
<p>Make sure and spend some time and look at how Google or Amazon is organizing their developer community. &nbsp;If any developer could go to any of the over 100 agencies, or the over 1000 domains, and find a consistent experience shared across <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span></strong> agency web API areas, like they do at Google or Amazon APIs, the chances for success of this iniative is much greater.</p>
<p>I hope someone in one of the agencies reads this, and understands the importance of this moment, and that an API is more than just a CSV or XML dump at a web address.  That, with the right business approach to deploying and managing we can truly transform how government interacts both internally, inter-agency and with the public.  Opening up the federal government to a whole new era of democratic participation, government transparency and interoperability.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/gnip/gnip-logo.jpg" alt="" width="160" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing some big data work.  Ok it isn&rsquo;t really, but feels like I should use that label.   What I&rsquo;m actually doing is analyzing the Twitter activity of top APIs.</p>
<p>I have the twitter handles of 100 of the popular web APIs.  I have been pulling and analyzing the Tweets from each of these accounts via the Twitter API for some time now.</p>
<p>It is time that I scale this to about 500 API twitter accounts, and also start monitoring mentions of each of these APIs on Twitte, while also performing searches for some keywords associated with each API or a group of APIs.</p>
<p>At this stage of growth, it was clear I was outgrowing the regular Twitter API and since what I&rsquo;m doing is more big data, than twitter client app, I am looking at the two approved Twitter resellers <a title="Gnip" href="http://gnip.com/">Gnip</a> and <a title="Datasift" href="http://datasift.com/">Datasift</a>.</p>
<p>First I went to Gnip,  looked at their product and it looked like what I needed.  I saw at the bottom of the page, &ldquo;Get Started&rdquo;.  I recognize that language, clicked on it and filled out their form and I get a &ldquo;Thank You, Someone Will Be In Touch&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/datasift/datasift-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Ok...so I move on to Datasift.  I look at their product and it too, looks like what I need.  I see on the page, &ldquo;Get Started&rdquo;.  I recognize that language, clicked on it, logged on with Twitter, added my email and password, and boom--I&rsquo;m dropped into a dashboard.  I am able to build streams from Twitter using different keywords, Twitter users, etc.  I get freemium access, with the ability to put in my credit card and be billed for more.</p>
<p>Next, I got a quick email from a nice fellow at Gnip asking what I was looking to do, and if I had time in the next couple days to talk on the phone. &nbsp;I will definitely talk with them, but by the time I get on the phone with them I will be 2-3 days into developing my solution around Datasift.  Unless Gnip has some secret pricing or some magic features Datasift doesn&rsquo;t have, I probably won&rsquo;t switch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the difference between self service and sales oriented web APIs.  Which one are you?</p>

<p>Many "<a title="public APIs" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/05/30/public-api-vs-open-api/">public APIs</a>" are launched with well, very "public" intent--to extend the reach of the brand and platform. Many of these APIs are setup to pull data, enabling developers to use it in their applications for free or paid, with the understanding they&rsquo;ll properly attribute the source.</p>
<p>Many of these APIs like Amazon E-Commerce, eBay, Google Places and Foursquare are engineered to publicly extend the central platform, all feeding back back to the &ldquo;mother ship&rdquo;, either through linking or other type of attribution.</p>
<p>As the Internet evolves, and the era of "big data" takes hold, and as the need for processing data and deriving meaning out of the flood of data available to us online grows--so does the demand for API access that isn&rsquo;t marketing centric.</p>
<p>As a big data developer I may be comparing product pricing from Amazon to auctions on eBay, and I may need to use Google Places data to identify best places to sell my products, and Foursquare to identify local demand.  The needs of big data API developers are going to be radically different than maybe your originally intended developer audience.</p>
<p>Hopefully you are already carefully targeting your developers and grouping them by their usage patterns.  Have you identified any users that are actively using your APIs, but not necessarily following regular patterns? &nbsp;Have you reached out to them?</p>
<p>It might be the case that your API won&rsquo;t be of interest to big data developers or quite possibly that this isn&rsquo;t a market you're interested in.  However it is a question every API owner should ask--<span style="text-decoration: underline;">is my API big data ready</span>?</p>

<p>Ok, can I call 2012, the year of the API now?  Of course this announcement makes me extremely excited!  This is something I didn't think I'd see in the next 5 years, but of course I'm super skeptical too.  Is this something that these agencies are capable of?  Is there enough political will to make happen?  I sure hope so.</p>
<p>I've seen some <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/05/open-government-reboot-focuses-on-apis-instead-of-data/">good coverage of this news on popular tech blogs</a>, but we'll have to wait 90 days and see ho many agencies have publicly reported on "progress in meeting the requirements of the Strategy in a machine-readable format", and ultimately how much momentum this actually gets--or if it gets forgotten.</p>
<p>As soon as I can find an API with all government agencies and their websites, I will make a monitoring dashboard showing how many agencies have published anything, and what it contains, and report on my findings in 90 days.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 May 2012</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/teapot-steaming.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>In my effort to better understand API access, I&rsquo;m studying how API owners control access to their APIs, with most recently being around Rate Limiting. The other day I asked,&nbsp;<a title="why do we limit API access for developers" href="/2012/05/29/why-do-we-limit-api-access-for-developers/">why do we limit API access for developers</a>, and even&nbsp;<a title="explored rewarding developers for heavy usage" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/01/should-we-be-limiting-developers-api-usage/">explored rewarding developers for heavy usage</a>.</p>
<p>As I continue to understand the impact of rate limits on developers it&rsquo;s becoming clearer that for an API to successfully impose rate limits, you should also be offering rate limit release valves in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Increase Request Form</strong>&nbsp;- There should be a formal, self-service way to request rate limits either for valid uses that you hadn&rsquo;t considered bumping up against rate limit ceiling, or quite possibly for non-commercial purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Utility Pricing</strong>&nbsp;- Providing a pay as you go model, where users meet the "courtesy limit", they can put in their credit card and pay for what they use above and beyond the default rate limit.</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="API Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Console-Rate-Limits.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are many points of friction for developers trying to integrate with an API. In my research, one of the ongoing complaints of developers regarding an API is around rate limits. Many of these complaints are directed at APIs who impose rate limits without any clear path beyond the default limits.</p>
<p>Google seems to be offering opportunities for developers to pay for use beyond their "courtesy limits", providing a form of release valve for developers concerns about API rate limits. &nbsp;Google is providing these release valves for API services via their&nbsp;<a title="API Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/">API Console</a>, but only appear to available for a handful of services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m still unsure about API rate limits in general, it seems clear that if you are going to limit, make sure and provide a release valve in some way, so developers understand what the options are when they hit the ceiling, and that there are opportunities to grow.</p>

<p>There is a <a title="new API edition to the healthcare industyr" href="http://www.lifeimage.com/landing/api">new API edition to the healthcare industry</a> this week.  lifeIMAGE launched an API that can be used by developers of healthcare applications, to enable the secure exchange of medical images and related patient records.</p>
<p>Norman Young, President and CEO of ClearCanvas, said <em>&ldquo;We were founded on the simple belief that medical imaging informatics should be accessible to all. Now, using the lifeIMAGE API, users of our FDA-cleared diagnostic viewer will be able to instantaneously share images that are in front of them with any one.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The healthcare is industry that is ripe for API adoption, so I&rsquo;m always looking for &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; new API stories for the space--<a title="lifeimage API" href="http://www.lifeimage.com/landing/api">lifeImage API</a> is perfect.  You can find out more about the API at  www.lifeimage.com/api.</p>

<p>I talk with a lot of entrepreneurs in my travels to conferences, hackathons and online with my API evangelism. I get a lot of ideas pitched to me, asking me for feedback, and ultimately if I think their startup is viable.</p>
<p>I hear a lot of good ones, and bad ones. Even the good ones face an uphill battle to get noticed in an extremely crowded and noisy landscape. The one piece of advice I leave with all startups about how to get their web or mobile app noticed?</p>
<p><strong>Develop an API!!</strong></p>
<p>The one thing an API can do for your startup is allow your product to become a feature in other platforms. If you deliver only as a mobile or web app, you are leaving out numerous opportunities to become the next killer Facebook or Salesforce feature, or something smaller like a Wordpress add-on, but ultimately something that could make enough of a mark, that your startup could survive.</p>
<p>So when you are planning the feature list for your killer startup, make sure you consider an API, and the potential of becoming the next killer feature in an existing platform.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 May 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-affiliate-network.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>In my quest to understand the monetization opportunities via APIs, I&rsquo;m studying the possibilites around tracking, and now monetization of content and URL&rsquo;s served up via APIs.</p>
<p>The other day I considered <a title="wrapping URLs for another layer of metrics in your API" href="/2012/05/26/wrapping-content-urls-for-another-layer-of-metrics-in-your-api/">wrapping URLs for another layer of metrics in your API</a>, and today I&rsquo;m thinking about how to evolve API monetization beyond advertising, defining entirely new API driven conversion events where both API owners and consumers, can realistically make money.</p>
<p>I first talked about an <a title="advertising network dedicated to APIs and developers" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/09/28/advertising-network-dedicated-to-apis-and-developers/">advertising network dedicated to APIs and developers</a> last year, and everytime I come back to it in my Evernote list, I can&rsquo;t help but consider using the <a title="Google Affiliate Network" href="http://www.google.com/ads/affiliatenetwork/">Google Affiliate Network</a> as an engine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any access to Google Affiliate Network (I submitted request), so all of this is speculative.  But after looking through the <a href="https://developers.google.com/affiliate-network/">Google Afffiliate Network API interface</a>, it looks like I can pull both advertisers, publishers and events through the API-- so I&rsquo;m envisioning two scenarios:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Owners</strong> - As an API owner I could use the Google Affiliate network to define &ldquo;events&rdquo; that could occur via my APIs, and setup my API developers as &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>API Consumers</strong> - As an API consumer I could setup various APIs I use as &ldquo;advertisers&rdquo;, creating specific events for these APIs, and setup my own applications or sites as &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-url-shortener.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>In either case, API owners or API consumers could replace any URLs in content or URLs directly served up via APIs with a Google Affiliate Network generated URL with specific conversion events defined, then shortened using <a title="Google URL Shortener API" href="https://developers.google.com/url-shortener/">Google URL Shortener API</a>.</p>
<p>This would create a layer of not just metrics, but conversion events that could be monetized.  API consumers could choose from affiliate opportunities available on the Google Affiliate Network, and API owners could do the same, or define their own conversion events that were meaningful to their business goals.</p>
<p>These are just some original thoughts on API monetization using <a href="https://developers.google.com/affiliate-network/">Google Afffiliate Network API</a> and the <a title="Google URL Shortener API" href="https://developers.google.com/url-shortener/">Google URL Shortener API</a>.  Seems like there is a lot of opportunity monetize the data and resources flowing through API pipes, whether you&rsquo;re an API owner or avid API consumer.</p>

<p><a title="Pinterest" href="http://pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a> and <a title="The Fancy" href="http://www.thefancy.com/">The Fancy</a> are locked in a deathmatch, if you hadn't heard? Compete wrote back in February that <a title="The Fancy was poised to take over a chunk of Pinterest's traffic" href="http://blog.compete.com/2012/02/29/with-the-launch-of-its-new-web-store-could-the-fancy-overtake-pinterest/">The Fancy was poised to take over a chunk of Pinterest's traffic</a> with their new webstore.  Fast forward 5 months, <a href="http://www.thefancy.com/help/mobile">The Fancy has just launched an update to their iOS</a> which includes the ability to purchase products from the mobile app with just one click.</p>
<p>Nice move!  The Fancy is definitely an easier and cleaner looking site than  Pinterest, and with a monetization move, The Fancy could gain even more market share against Pinterest.</p>
<p>Now if The Fancy wanted to seal the deal and put a death nail in Pinterest's coffin, they should launch an API, and make The Fancy a platform.  Don't just open up API access to your content--open up API access to your new commerce layer as well.</p>
<p>Once you have this mapped out, deploy a well crafted suite of embeddable objects, like share and buy buttons, along with essential widgets--all with the commerce layer built in.</p>

<p>Developers and non-developers will make sure The Fancy becomes ubiquitous across the web, and because you chose to consider monetization, while making your platform play, and included developers in this model, the entire platform will be sustainable and outlast anything Pinterest can come up with.</p>

<p>I recently stumbled across the <a title="University of Washingtons Web Services Area" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2012/05/29/university-information-access-with-apis/">University of Washington&rsquo;s Web Services area</a>, where they are working to create a single place to learn about, discover and connect with various APIs that are available at the University.</p>
<p>As the home page says:</p>
<blockquote><em>Web Services at the University of Washington is a method of getting important institutional data from and/or into your applications. Web Services are a way for applications or systems to talk to one another and does not usually involve human interaction.</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m always trying to understand where the next wave of API growth might come from, and while the enterprise is definintely sitting on a treasure chest of information and resources, just waiting to be exposed via APIs--I think Universities might be in the same position.</p>
<p>As soon as Universities start realizing how many APIs they have laying around already, and understand the potential of launching new ones, they are going to have a massive API management problem.</p>
<p>I stumbled across UW APIs via a <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> update of 7 web services from the University.  I started looking around further, and discovered there were 29 total APIs available at UW Web Services.  I&rsquo;m not sure why only 7 are listed at PW, but right there you start seeing slippage in the current API directory model.</p>
<p>Quickly invdividual schools are going to face the same <a title="problems Google has faced with its almost 100 APIs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/12/21/business-of-google-apis-2011/">problems Google has faced with its almost 100 APIs</a> and need to standardize their management platform with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Access</strong> - Usage of a healthy balance of keys and OAuth for accessing school and student data&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Discovery</strong> - Establish some sort of WADL or other discovery service that can feed not just a human directory but IDEs and other programmatic discovery.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Explorer</strong> - Provide an API explorer so developers and even non-programmers can make calls against any API without writing code&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Billing</strong> - Establish some sort of billing layer, if only for making high volume users pay for access and pay for infrastructure--but also possibly opening up new revenue streams for universities</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/universities/univeristy-info-systems.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>In addition to these areas, Universities will have to establish a common set of API building blocks that they will use across all departments, creating a consistent API area for developers to use while learning about and integrating with University Web Services.</p>
<p>With some proper planning and a little work, each University could setup a highly functional API strateg and management framework allowing them to efficiently manage not just dozens of APIs, but thousands across all areas of the University.</p>
<p>Think of the opportunities for students to build out much needed mobile and web applications around school information as part of class projects.  The benefits of having self-service interfaces that individual departments can use to get the information they need, as well as for 3rd party vendors who need access to vital school data.</p>
<p>Next, would be to create a state and federal discovery layer on top of each University, allowing better oversight and interaction between government and Universities--but that will have to come later, we have a lot of work to do at each University before we get there.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/05/29/why-do-we-limit-api-access-for-developers/">Why Do We Limit API Access for Developers?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 May 2012</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/API-Rate-Limiting.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am putting a lot of thought into why we limit API access for developers. &nbsp;I understand requiring keys to access APIs, and tracking who has access to your API, so you can understand how they are using it. What I don&rsquo;t understand is why you&rsquo;d want to limit API access.</p>
<p>By limit, I mean...here is an API, you get 100 calls, then no more! No option for paying, begging or pleading for more access. There are some APIs (I will evaluate specific APIs in the future), that have this approach, and it just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.</p>
<p>Last year I touched on this subject with a post in ProgrammableWeb called,&nbsp;<a title="Should We Be Limiting Developers&rsquo; API Usage" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/01/should-we-be-limiting-developers-api-usage/">Should We Be Limiting Developers&rsquo; API Usage</a>? Where I flip this model on its head and showcase two API providers, YellowAPI and ironically enough Qwerly (another story by itself), and how they were actually rewarding developers for more API usage.</p>
<p>I understand that in the early days, limiting access was a way to keep people from using their APIs too much, but I think in the era of cloud computing, that throttling as opposed to limiting is a better option. Let price control a developers API usage, and set that price at a level that is logical for this equation.</p>
<p>If your limiting developers from using your API, why even have one? It seems like you should sit down and re-evaluate your business model. I hope you don&rsquo;t have other products that your customers can access, that at some point you cut them off and say, you can&rsquo;t have anymore.</p>

<p>APIs are making information more accessible across many industries and sectors, but one area I haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of movement, until recently, is at Universities.</p>

<p>Its grest to see that the University is trying to create a single directory of all University web services, and even has an API suggestion service where students and faculty can submit and vote on ideas for new, useful campus APIs.</p>

<p>With the volatility of school funding, online learning and just overall competition in higher ed, Universities need to start noticing of the transformative powers of APIs, and how it can make University operations more transparent, accessible and nimble, and potentially even save money when it comes to empowering the students themselves to build interfaces for accessing vital University information.</p>

<p>Twitter just <a href="http://engineering.twitter.com/2012/05/improving-performance-on-twittercom.html">rolled back their architectural approach for Twitter.com</a> back to a server side implementation.</p>
<p>If you remember back in September of 2010, <a href="/admin/blog/twitter+eats+own+dogfood+api+evangelist">Twitter rebuilt Twitter.com to use a web application architecture</a> that pushed all of the UI rendering and logic to Javascript running in the browser and consumed the Twitter API directly.</p>
<p>Now they are "taking back control" of their front-end performance by moving the rendering back to the server.  They don't say whether they don't use the APIs at all, but I am working under the assumption that they abandoned them.</p>
<p>Twitter felt the API driven web application architecture broke new ground, offered a number of advantages, but it lacked support for various optimization techniques available only on the server.</p>
<p>I was excited to see Twitter go with the API driven approach, along other sites, like <a title="FCC Website" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/04/06/everything-should-be-an-api-says-fcc/">the FCC</a>. &nbsp;I hate to see them abandon it.</p>
<p><em><strong>What does this say about an API oriented architecture?</strong></em></p>
<p>Are we not ready?  Are there are not enough tools for optimization, or the talent to deliver the performance necessary for Internet at scale via API driven architecture? &nbsp;Or maybe there are other business reasons for stopping eating their own dog food and going back to a server side architecture?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m documenting Twitter&rsquo;s process of wrapping the URLs contained within tweets, using a shorter URL like t.co.  I&rsquo;m interested in understanding the opportunities around URL wrapping (aka URL shortening) as an API business strategy.</p>
<p>From an API business perspective, the reasoning for implementing URL wrapping as part of your API would be:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Saving Space </strong>- By shortening URLs you are reducing the length of any string that contains URLs, and in cases like Twitters, every character counts</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - Twitter is actively combating URLs that carry malicious intent</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong> - Each shortened URL provides a mechanism for tracking clicks on URL within content</li>
</ul>
<p>Shold URL wrapping be something API owners adopt for all content served up via an API?  Could every URL within content served up via an API be wrapped, allowing tracking of clicks through that URL--no matter where that content ended up living after it left the API?</p>
<p>Just some initial thoughts, but it seems that a comprehensive linking strategy could be established, bundled with a URL shortening service like <a href="https://bitly.com/">Bit.ly</a>, <a href="http://goo.gl/">Google URL Shortener</a> or a custom service--and provide a new layer of metrics that could be used to tell how your developers and their application users are interacting with the content you serve up via your API.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to explain what APIs are to someone sitting next to me on the plane is to find something the user does every day, that is driven by an API, and explain how an API drives the functionality they take for granted.</p>
<p>I tend to look for industry specific examples if they are an accountant or stock broker, but the most common example I use, is Facebook.  Facebook is technology everyone I meet has exposure with.</p>
<p>My story always starts with Facebook.com, and how the social networking website was built for people.  People go to www.facebook.com and they see HTML web pages, that allow them to interact with the community.</p>
<p>Next I move to the Facebook application on their mobile phone.  While the application is built for people to use, the application needs a way to talk with Facebook--in comes APIs.  APIs are a way for other programs to interact with Facebook, providing a interface for developers to build applications that use Facebook.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/iPhone-Facebook-Login.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>When you first login to Facebook on your mobile phone, the applications makes a request to the Facebook Authentication API, and gives your mobile application rights to interact with your Facebook account on your behalf.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/iPHone-Facebook-Auth.png" alt="" width="325" align="left" /></p>
<p>After your logged into the Facebook application on your mobile app, every action you take will make an API call.  When you click on your news feed, update your status, look at photos or check-in to a place, they each represent a different call to the <a title="Facebook Open Graph API" href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/">Facebook Open Graph API</a>.   The Open Graph API exposes almost every aspect of Facebook as a programmatic interface that applications can use, hence the name Application Programming Interface (API).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most online technologies that you use everyday have APIs.  Amazon, EBay, Facebook, Twitter and Google all have APIs, allowing developers to build applications on top of their businesses, turning their websites into web services.</p>
<p>With the grwoth of the smart phone and tablet markets, the number of, and usage of APIs are exploding, silently driving the mobile applications like Facebook that are part of your everyday lives.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 May 2012</span>
        <p><a title="Pinterest" href="http://pinterest.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/pinterest/Pinterest_Logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Here we are going into June, and I still don&rsquo;t see a publicly available <a title="Pinterest" href="http://pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> API.  Jay Yarow wrote in Business Insider back in February, "<a title="Pinterest's API Is Coming Soon, And VCs Are Super Excited" href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-03-26/tech/31238519_1_mobile-apps-twitterrific-hootsuite">Pinterest's API Is Coming Soon, And VCs Are Super Excited</a>" and Adam Duvander wrote in ProgrammableWeb, "<a title="Pinterest API: Coming Soon or Already Here" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/02/09/pinterest-api-coming-soon-or-already-here/">Pinterest API: Coming Soon or Already Here</a>?".</p>
<p>There is also a <a title="reply to a Quora thread by Yashh Nelapati" href="http://www.quora.com/Pinterest/Is-there-an-API-for-Pinterest-that-allows-users-to-display-a-set-of-pins-photos-on-your-own-website">reply to a Quora thread by Yashh Nelapati</a>, Lead Engineer at Pinterest from May 2011, saying the API is 2-3 weeks away.  It&rsquo;s now a year later and there is no official API (<a title="rogue api" href="http://tijn.bo.lt/pinterest-api">there is a Rogue API</a>).</p>
<p><a title="Business Insider" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/">Business Insider</a> says, Pinterest fears having a <strong><em>"<a title="Twitter Problem" href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-03-26/tech/31238519_1_mobile-apps-twitterrific-hootsuite">Twitter problem</a>&rdquo;</em></strong>.  Meaning that when Twitter released its API, it was still an immature company, allowing developers to build applications with features that it was missing--then Twitter matured, and it wanted to control its platform, it began adding building its own features and poaching from the Twitter API ecosystem.</p>
<p>So why not learn from Twitter and other APIs, and use the appropriate API building blocks to address this:</p>
<p><a title="Pinterest" href="http://pinterest.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/pinterest/Pinterest-Home-Page.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Branding Guidelines</strong> - Establish branding guidelines that clearly lays out what apps that use Pinterest API should look like</li>
<li><strong>UI / UX Toolkit</strong> - Provide a UI / UX toolkit like Twitter Bootstrap that sets the tone for applications built on the API</li>
<li><strong>Roadmap</strong> - Provide a real-time and transparent roadmap that developers can use to help keep their development efforts in line with Pinterest</li>
<li><strong>Developer Framework</strong> - Establish a developer framework outlining opportunities for developers to become stronger members of API community, also introducing possible investment and incubation of most success or important features</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Use</strong> - Establish a fair and equitable terms of use that protects Pinterests but acknowledges the commercial aspirations of developers</li>
<li><strong>Events / Meetups</strong> - Establish a roadshow or network of meetups that brings developers together and makes them part of the Pinterest API community</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the ways Pinterest could establish a solid business strategy for their API that would not only protect developer interests, it would establish the Pinterest API as an external research &amp; development department, with a built in incubation component.</p>
<p>Pinterest has already missed out on a year of developers innovating on their platform.  Why continue holding back innovation?  Establish a flexible API business strategy that allows for you to learn from the mistakes made by Twitter, and become the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pinterests-api-is-coming-soon-and-vcs-are-super-excited-2012-2">platform VC&rsquo;s are looking for you to become</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for solid examples of how more and more of our every day world is being driven by APIs.  Examples I can use to help explain APIs to every-day business folks.</p>
<p>I came across one example that will speak to many business executives today via an <a title="Apigee Innovator Spotlight on their client TradeKing" href="http://blog.apigee.com/detail/innovator_spotlight_tradeking/">Apigee Innovator Spotlight on their client TradeKing</a>.  When asked about the vision of their API program Dan Raju CIO of TradeKing says:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/tradeking/TradeKing-CIO.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></p>
<blockquote><em>We are one of the top-ranked online brokerages in the country, growing very rapidly. We manage people's assets, give them a set of capabilities to trade, and offer an extremely transparent pricing structure. However, we recognized that our customers&rsquo; demands for next-generation interfaces are rapidly changing, and our API helps us stay in front of that. We anticipate that in the next phase, the API will be a meaningful revenue driver for us. It is already opening us up to new markets.  We will continue to develop our own platforms on the API and incentivize and engage our development partners.  At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s all about delivering value to our customers, and the API will continue to help us drive increased value at an accelerated pace.</em></blockquote>

<p>Raju hits on all the best of the API buzzwords including transparency, rapid change, meaningful revenue, open to new markets, and delivering value to end-customers.</p>
<p>I feel TradeKings vision of their API program, speak to larger visions of the API driven economy we are now immersed in, and provide a great example we can reference when helping other companies not just understand what an API is, but the imperative for their companies to embrace APIs and actively join the API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 May 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/Facebook-Developer.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Facebook provides an interface for Open Graph API developers to better understand how users are interacting with content via their applications, called&nbsp;<a title="Insights" href="http://www.facebook.com/help/search/?q=insights">Insights</a>.</p>
<p>With Insights you can monitor the number of your unique users that are seeing and accessing a Facebook authorization dialog, number of unique users publishers stories through Open graph as well as viewing and clicking on those stories.</p>
<p>While the number of users clicking, viewing on stories is very cool, I&rsquo;m interested in their stats regarding the authorization dialog.  Insights provides data on how many times people access your dialog authorization, with the number of acceptances, while also breaking down the number of views, acceptances into a corresponding conversion rate.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/facebook-insights-auth.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>If your authorization dialog prompts users for different permission sets, you&rsquo;ll also see a breakdown of the impressions, accepts and CTR for each one, showing you the rates at which people accept and reject different permission sets--helping you to identify the most optimal permission set for your authorization dialog, which will directly help increase user installs for your app.</p>
<p>This kind of insights for developers is critical, helping them understand the level of engagement with users and build a more effective Auth Dialog flow, which could make or break an applications Facebook Open Graph integration and adoption.</p>
<p>Providing developers with analytics to evaluate their users API usage is so valuable, I wonder if I can find any other examples of this granular type of OAuth reporting with other APIs or from API service providers like Apigee?</p>

The pace at which companies are launching public APIs is accelerating, with the last 1,000 added in just 3 months.</p>
<p>Any of us in the space knows that this is just the <a title="tip of the iceberg" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/11/03/private-api/">tip of the iceberg</a>, and Adam acknowledges that internal API usage is a major factor in API growth.  While public APIs get all the major press, there are many private API initiatives that won&rsquo;t see the light of day.</p>
<p>So my question is, how are we going to track on the growth of private APIs along with public APIs?  Since mobile app development is such an important piece, can we count mobile apps produced by a company?  Can we count on API service providers to start reporting on this data?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the answer.  It is something I think we need to figure out, not just so ProgrammableWeb can have its finger on the pulse, but there is an ever increasing amount of business and personal resources flowing through these API pipes, we need to have an understanding of where these API pipes are laid, which industries, etc.</p>
<p>Much like the rollout of fiber in the late 90&rsquo;s, we are going to see massive API rollouts, without much oversight and map of where these virtual pipes are.  I&rsquo;d like to hear more about how we can work together to build a map of the back-end of the new API driven economy.</p>

In my mind I see an interconnected world of products and commerce, where every business has an API.</p>
<p>APIs finally seem to be maturing, reaching a point where they can deliver at the scale and reliability we need, to really make this happen.  Three good examples of this are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="The StructuredRetailProducts.com API" href="http://www.structuredretailproducts.com/tab/api.html">The StructuredRetailProducts.com API</a></strong> - Providing to access to over 3 million individual product listings from 1700+ companies, representing total sales of over &pound;3,382 billion and counting. Access 15+ years of product and market data across 72 different countries at the click of a button and get the latest data on sales volumes, activity levels, and market share.</li>
<li><strong><a title="The Elastic Path Digital Commerce API" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/">The Elastic Path Digital Commerce API</a></strong> - A Digital Commerce Engine&trade; for driving any e-commerce experience, on any device or platform, allowing companies to build compelling product experiences, leverage new business models, and extend their reach to emerging end points.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Stripe API" href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe API</a></strong> - A complete payment platform, that handles everything, including storing cards, subscriptions, and direct payouts to your bank account, without a merchant account or gateway.</li>
</ul>

<p>Last week Facebook <a title="announced a new App Center" href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2012/05/09/introducing-the-app-center/">announced a new App Center</a> where developers can submit applications they've built. &nbsp;Like any API owner, Facebook is looking for high quality applications to list in its directory and has published a list of App Center Best Practices:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Websites must provide a personalized experienc</strong>e - All websites and mobile web apps need to immediately present authenticated users with a logged-in experience. Specifically, we&rsquo;re looking for personalization, such as name and profile picture, so users know that their Facebook information is being used to create an account. </li>
<li><strong>Review your app settings </strong>- App detail pages are dynamic based on the integrations you&rsquo;ve specified on the basic settings page of the Developer App. Be sure to review this and remove any old or non-functional integrations. </li>
<li><strong>Provide high-quality images -</strong> Your images should match the quality of your app. As specified in the guidelines, images shouldn&rsquo;t have buttons, excessive text, borders, dropshadows, URLs, promotions, pricing, or third-party logos. </li>
<li><strong>Input accurate names &amp; thoughtful descriptions -</strong> Don&rsquo;t add any additional keywords to the name of your app. Proofread your app description for spelling and grammar and remove unnecessary symbols, like stars, hearts and multiple exclamation points.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some food for thought. Every app center will be different and have different requirements. I think I will add App Center Best Practices as a <a title="building block" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">building block</a>, after I look at a wide selection of other API app showcases, and identify some common best practices.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 May 2012</span>
        <p><a title="PeopleBrowsr Kred API" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/peoplebrowsr/kr_pb_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Explaining to developers, what an API does, can be hard.  How you describe your API, the underlying endpoints, can make or break user adoption.  You shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to evolve, and keep trying to find the sweet spot in both the language and branding that you use in your API area.</p>
<p>I saw an example of this today, with the restructuring of <a href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/">PeopleBrowsr's APis</a>.  When I first starting playing with PeopleBrowsr's APIs, they were broken into 3 separate APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>PeopleBrowsr API</li>
<li>Kredentials API</li>
<li>Kred API</li>
</ul>
<p>On the surface its really hard to know what each of these APIs does, but after I dove in I saw lots of value within individual methods, but I really had to spend time, getting to know each method, one by one.  I saw the value, but the structure and presentation of the PeopleBrowsr API area, and the way the interfaces were assembled, didn&rsquo;t immediately speak to this value.</p>
<p>Today they&rsquo;ve restructured their three APis into a single API, dubbed the <a title="PeopleBrowsr Kred API" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/">PeopleBrowsr Kred API</a>, and grouped all the API methods into four logical groups:</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/peoplebrowsr/kred-dashboard.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Find Influencers" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/find">Find Influencers</a></strong> -  Pinpoints influential people on any subject or within communities connected by shared interests or affinities.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Deep Analytics" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/deep">Deep Analytics</a></strong> -  Author-based analytics which includes Kredentials (a single-screen summary of anyone&rsquo;s social presence), historical Kred scores, reach, and friends &amp; followers. </li>
<li><strong><a title="Action Analytics" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/action">Action Analytics</a></strong> - Aggregated social data metrics for any keyword, hashtag or @name, including mention counts, word clouds and hashtag clouds.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Global Kred Score" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/kred">Global Kred Score</a></strong> - Appends global Kred scores to @names or twitter IDs in web-based applications. </li>
</ul>
<p>This new presentation immediately helps me understand which methods I should use based upon my goals.  PeopleBrowsr took the time to understand how developers were using their API, and worked to present the API in a way that best speaks to this.</p>
<p>PeopleBrowsr also took the time to understand the value delivered via their API in each of these new areas and restructure pricing to reflect this value:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Find Influencers -  $1.00 per call</li>
<li>Deep Analytics -  .10 cents per call</li>
<li>Action Analytics  - .01 cent per call</li>
<li>Global Kred Score  - Free</li>
</ul>
<p>Only time will tell if the new structure of the <a title="PeopleBrowsr Kred API" href="https://developer.peoplebrowsr.com/">PeopleBrowsr Kred API</a> will truly speak to developers that are looking to harvest insights from social media, but I like what they did to understand the needs of their developers, and work to better deliver the API presentation, documentation and pricing to reflect this need.</p>
<p>Make sure you are tuned into what your API developers are looking for and aren&rsquo;t afraid to evolve and better serve your developer community.</p>
<p><em>Disclosure: &nbsp;I have consulted for PeopleBrowsr in the past.</em></p>

<p>API metrics are an essential, but what should we measure?  There are two metrics that seems to dominate discussions about success of the API industry:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Number of New API Registration</li>
<li>Number of Daily and Monthly API Calls</li>
</ul>
<p>Every API I&rsquo;ve consulted with, use the same two metrics, if they have any at all.  The tech blogosphere (driven by <a title="API service proviers" href="http://apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/">API service providers</a>) have created a so call <a title="billionaires club" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/25/who-belongs-to-the-api-billionaires-club/">billionaires club</a>, showcasing APIs that have over a billion API calls within a day or month.</p>
<p>Investors are even using the number of API calls as a<a title="considered a metric you can use to consider the valuation of a company by investors" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/03/kleiner-klout-30-million/">&nbsp;metric to consider the valuation of a company</a>, and seen as a good indicator of the demand for a company&rsquo;s services.</p>
<p>I agree that new registrations and number of API calls are a start, but we should be able to identify many other metrics to truly measure the activity and success of an API and the sentiment of it's API developer community.</p>

<p><a title="USDA&rsquo;s Agricultural Marketing Service" href="http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/">USDA&rsquo;s Agricultural Marketing Service</a> (AMS) has released a new, publicly available <a title="web API for its Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) system" href="http://marketnews.usda.gov/portal/lg/lmprswsreg">web API for its Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) system</a>, offering access to all historical LMR data, allowing users to pull large amounts of customized data sets via a RESTful interface with JSON embedded URLs and XML formatted output.</p>
<blockquote><em>"The Livestock Mandatory Reporting program facilitates open, transparent price discovery and provides all market participants, both large and small, with comparable levels of market information for cattle, swine, sheep, beef and lamb meat," said Craig Morris, Deputy Administrator of the AMS Livestock and Seed Program. "This new web service will provide our customers with additional resources to obtain large volumes of data."</em></blockquote>

<p>In 2001, USDA&rsquo;s Agricultural Marketing Service implemented the Livestock Mandatory Reporting program as required by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock_Mandatory_Reporting_Act_of_1999">Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act of 1999</a>, establishing a program to track information on the marketing of cattle, swine, lambs, and the products of such livestock, providing information that can be readily understood by producers to improve the price and supply reporting services of the Department of Agriculture, while also encouraging competition in the marketplace for livestock and livestock products.</p>
<p>A great example of APIs providing being used to manage and regulate industries while also letting markets freely operate, and encouraging competition.  Imagine that, the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>This summer its been 2 years since I started API Evangelist.  API Evangelist started as my research project into the Business of APIs, and became a full time career.</p>
<p>While over the last two years I&rsquo;ve worked for clients like <a title="Mimeo" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> and <a title="CityGrid" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com">CityGrid</a>, my ultimate goal is to focus on studying the Business of APIs.  So whenever I get the time, I study how popular APIs operate, and how they are transforming industries.</p>
<p>This month, I&rsquo;m getting the opportunity to dive deeper into my research around different API business models, with the chance to look at the politics within specific API ecosystems.</p>
<p>While my research will always span the entire API sector, this round I&rsquo;m going to study the approach of some of the most successful APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - Deep understanding of the largest, and most important API ecosystem</li>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> - Better understanding of the largest API driven social platform</li>
<li><strong>Google</strong> - Document the 100 or so APIs offered by Google, and the platform that connects them</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> - Better picture of the leading business social network platform</li>
<li><strong>Amazon</strong> - Document the history of this API pioneer</li>
<li><strong>Twilio</strong> - Understand how Twilio continues to deliver their API, and woo developers</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to begin by&nbsp;<a title="analyzing the business and politics of Twitters API ecosystem" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/05/06/the-business-and-politics-of-twitters-api/">analyzing the business and politics of Twitters API ecosystem</a>, and as more funding comes through I&rsquo;ll focus on the other APis.  While studying each API I look at:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Historical company blog posts, tweets and press releases</li>
<li>Historical blog posts and tweets from the blogosphere and developers</li>
</ul>
<p>I organize all my research into a curation framework I&rsquo;ve developed and will be generating:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Timeline</strong> - A easy to navigate, timeline of the APIs history through curated blog posts, tweets and company announcments.</li>
<li><strong>Blog Posts</strong>&nbsp;- Single and series of blog posts documenting the business and politics of each API provider.</li>
<li><strong>Final Paper(s)</strong> - Each project will have at least one final white-paper with findings from the research.</li>
<li><strong>Raw Research</strong> - A searchable repository of curated research and notes from my work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then making this work available across both <a title="apievangelist.com" href="http://apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a> and my new blog <a title="apivoice.com" href="http://apivoice.com">apivoice.com</a>, which tends to focus on the politics of APIs including legal and other issues affecting developer ecosystems.</p>
<p>I feel pretty strongly that this new round of research will help me better understand the business and politics of APIs, produce rich research, stories and industry reports that I can make available--helping us all better understand this ever changing API economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 May 2012</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-legal.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I attended a great webinar put on by the folks at <a title="Apigee" href="/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a> last week, where they discussed <a title="APIs &amp; Copyright" href="http://www.slideshare.net/apigee/apis-copyrights">APIs &amp; Copyright</a>.  A very timely discussion with the recent API copyright decision in the EU, and from the ongoing <a title="Oracle vs. Google" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/05/07/us-precedent-for-api-copyright-hinges-on-oracle-v-google/">Oracle vs. Google case</a>.</p>
<p>As I process all discussions around API copyright, I&rsquo;m going to publish relevant pieces here at <a title="API Voice" href="http://apivoice.com/">API Voice</a>, for everyone else to process along with me.  One interesting piece of the Apigee discussion is that APIs have been copyrightable for the last 22 years--specifically referencing the <a href="http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=19892059886F2d1173_11869.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR2-1986-2006">JOHNSON CONTROLS, INC. v. PHOENIX CONTROL SYSTEMS, INC.</a> from October 3rd, 1989.  On <a href="http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?page=3&amp;xmldoc=19892059886F2d1173_11869.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR2-1986-2006&amp;SizeDisp=7">page three</a>, it states:</p>
<blockquote><em>"A computer program is made up of several different components, including the source and object code, the structure, sequence and/or organization of the program, the user interface, and the function, or purpose, of the program. Whether a particular component of a program is protected by a copyright depends on whether it qualifies as an "expression" of an idea, rather than the idea itself."</em></blockquote>
<p>Beyond Johnson Controls, Inc v. Phoenix Control Systems, it appears there is further precedent to apply copyright to APIs.  The filing also references:</p>
<blockquote><em>See Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.,<a href="http://www.leagle.com/xmlcontentlinks.aspx?gfile=471%20U.S.%20539">471 U.S. 539</a>, 547, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 2223, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985); Data East USA, Inc. v.

<p>I think the questions API owners and developers should be asking themselves is not, whether or not they might have to think about API copyright protection in the future, but that it is something they should be discussing now, when it comes to their other legal API&nbsp;building blocks like&nbsp;<a title="terms of use" href="/buildingblocks/terms_of_use__conditions.php">terms of use</a>,&nbsp;<a title="privacy" href="/buildingblocks/privacy.php">privacy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="branding" href="/buildingblocks/branding.php">branding</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 May 2012</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for API stories that capture the power of APIs, showcasing how they are transforming industries and businesses around the globe. Today, my global API monitoring platform picked up one such story in Edinburg, Scotland.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2011, the summer-based <a title="Edinburgh Festivals" href="http://www.edinburghfestivals.co.uk/">Edinburgh Festivals</a> made their event listings data publicly available for digital developers and technologists, via web APIs.  There are seven events participating in the API:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/edinburgh-festivals/edinburgh-photo1.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Edinburgh Jazz &amp; Blues Festival" href="http://www.edinburghjazzfestival.com/">Edinburgh Jazz &amp; Blues Festival</a></li>
<li><a title="Edinburgh Art Festival" href="http://www.edinburghartfestival.com/">Edinburgh Art Festival</a></li>
<li><a title="Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo" href="http://www.edintattoo.co.uk/">Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo</a></li>
<li><a title="Edinburgh Mela" href="http://www.edinburgh-mela.co.uk/">Edinburgh Mela</a></li>
<li><a title="Edinburgh International Festival" href="http://www.eif.co.uk/">Edinburgh International Festival</a></li>
<li><a title="Edinburgh International Book Festival" href="http://www.edbookfest.co.uk/">Edinburgh International Book Festival</a></li>
<li><a title="Edinburgh Festival Fringe" href="http://www.edfringe.com/">Edinburgh Festival Fringe</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite all the printed brochures and media coverage, with 44,000 performances in 3,000 separate venues, discovery, planning and finding what you want to see at the Edinburgh festivals is a near impossible task.  Event organizers needed a way to provide the most up to date event information for the media and press, while also delivering the most enhanced experience possible for festival goers.</p>
<p>So, upholding their commitment to openness and innovation, the <a href="http://festivalslab.com/">Edinburgh Festival organizers decided to release their data via API</a>.  With an API they hoped to challenge developers to build things that extended the reach of the festival, beyond what the event could do themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://festivalslab.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/edinburgh-festivals/Edinburgh-Festivals-Innovation-Lab.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
</ul>
<p>Immediately festival organizers started seeing innovation around the API, and further encouraged developers with the <a href="http://ideas.edinburghfestivals.co.uk/">Edinburgh Festivals Idea Challenge</a>, offering prizes to the top 25 of 291 ideas submitted. &nbsp;The Edinburgh Festival API has spawned many projects including:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Festipods</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; a fun and engrossing way of visualizing the Edinburgh festival events that you have attended</li>
<li><strong>Festivalclock.com</strong>&nbsp;- a beautiful visualisation of the summer festivals listings information</li>
<li><strong>FakeFringe</strong>&nbsp;- a fun game where players have to guess which Fringe show description is real and which is the fake</li>
<li><strong>Festafriend</strong>&nbsp;- a website that uses the festivals as a way for people to date and make new friends</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/acoulton">Andrew Coulton (@acoulton)</a>, of the Ediburgh International Book Festival was very excited about APIs from the beginning, realizing there was a lot that they wanted to accomplish, but didn't have the resources internally to make happen, and had hopes that the API could help deliver.  Coulton states that when you focus on providing the best quality data possible, building a developer community--that is when the most exciting things happen can happen around your API.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/edinburgh-festivals/Andrew-Coulton.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>Looking back, Coulton says they had to focus on three key areas, to make the API happen:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Business</strong> - Making the business case for deploying an API</li>
<li><strong>Technical</strong> - Overcoming technical challenges with deploying an API</li>
<li><strong>Emotional</strong> - Overcoming historically proprietary attitudes of event organizers regarding their data</li>
</ul>
<p>The Edinburgh Festival's innovation around their API is a great case-study for any business, arts, tourism or sporting event organizer, who wants to take their event to the next level.  While there are definitely some major challenges to deploying a festival API, the potential for strengthening the event's brand, showcasing performers, keeping media up-to-date and creating the best possible experience for festival goers is massive.</p>

<p>There are a lot of high value APIs emerging these days,  APIs with access to essential business data, resources and intelligence.</p>
<p>When designing your API you want to make the interface as intuitive as possible, and ensure&nbsp;as wide as access to it as you possibly can.&nbsp;To quote Jonathan Schwartz, Sun CEO regarding Java APIs:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We wanted to build the biggest tent and invite as many people as possible,&rdquo; Schwartz said. &ldquo;You have open APIs and compete on implementations."</em></blockquote>
<p>To do this, I encourage building tools and widgets that non-developers can use when working with your API.  A great example of this is at Google, with their <a title="Google Analytics Dashboard" href="http://analytics-api-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/reporting/javascript/ez-ga-dash/docs/user-documentation.html">Google Analytics Dashboard Library</a>.  Google wanted to make it <a title="easier for users to deploy a dashboard" href="http://analytics.blogspot.com/2012/05/new-google-analytics-easy-dashboard.html">easier for users to deploy a dashboard</a> that was tailored specifically for their business, so using a team of University of California Irvine students, they set out to simplify it down to 3 steps:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Register with Google APIs Console.</li>
<li>Copy and paste the JavaScript code.</li>
<li>Configure this code to query your data and choose a chart type to visualize it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, you still have to be JavaScript savvy to work with the Google Analytics Dashboard Library, understand how to edit your site, and be fluent in Google Analytics--but it&rsquo;s a step closer to providing wider access to the power of the <a title="Google Analytics API" href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics API</a>, beyond just the development community.</p>
<p>LinkedIn also has some great examples of taking concept this to the next level with their <a title="plugin builders" href="https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins/member-profile-plugin-generator">&ldquo;plugin&rdquo; builders</a> which essentially generates the widgets for users, using the API. Since Google is going to keep working with the Google Analytics Dashboard Library over the next 3 quarters, so I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll see their library evolve as well.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/linkedin/LinkedIn-Widget-Builder.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep exploring other great examples of API embeddable strategies that can potentially bring in a much wider audience, opening up your API for access beyond developers, potentially bringing in other more business oriented groups.</p>

They have built a&nbsp;<a title="field guide to Twitter Platform objects" href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects">field guide to Twitter Platform objects</a>, designed like an <a title="Audubon Society" href="http://www.audubon.org/">Audubon Society</a> field guide, describing the four primaty Twitter objects:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Tweets</strong> -&nbsp;Also known as a&nbsp;Status Update, Tweets are the basic atomic unit of all things Twitter. Users&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/update">create Tweets</a>. Tweets can be&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-tweets">embedded</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/update">replied to</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/favorites/create/%3Aid">favorited</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/favorites/destroy/%3Aid">unfavorited</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/retweet/%3Aid">retweeted</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/destroy/%3Aid">unretweeted</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/destroy/%3Aid">deleted</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong> -&nbsp;Users can be anyone or anything. They&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/update">tweet</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/friendships/create">follow</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/lists/create">create lists</a>, have a&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/home_timeline">home_timeline</a>, can be&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/mentions">mentioned</a>, and can be<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/users/lookup">looked up</a>&nbsp;in bulk.</li>
<li><strong>Entities</strong> -&nbsp;Entities provide metadata and additional contextual information about content posted on Twitter. Entities are never divorced from the content they describe. After May 14th, 2012&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tweet-entities">Tweet Entities</a>&nbsp;will be returned wherever&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects/tweets">Tweets</a>&nbsp;are found in the API. Entities are instrumental in&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tco-url-wrapper">resolving URLs</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Places</strong> -&nbsp;Places are specific, named locations with corresponding geo coordinates. They can be attached to&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects/tweets">Tweets</a>&nbsp;by specifying a&nbsp;<tt>place_id</tt>&nbsp;when&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/update">tweeting</a>. Tweets associated with places are not necessarily issued from that location but could also potentially be&nbsp;<em>about</em>&nbsp;that location.&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/geo/id/%3Aplace_id">Places</a>&nbsp;can be&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/geo/place">created</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/geo/search">searched for</a>. Tweets can also be&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/places/finding-tweets-about-places">found</a>&nbsp;by place_id.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>It is a creative way to educate users about the Twitter API, making it more visually appealing. Beyond that, I'm not sure it helps developers get up and running using the API, but who knows...it might make it more accessible to some users.</span></p>
<p><span>Have you seen any other creative wasy of displaying API documentaton?</span></p>

<p>In my <a title="Google Reader" href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> I curate hundreds of articles pulled from 600+ blogs and 25+ real-time Google Alerts, on a daily basis.  Everything I star in my Google Reader or Tweet about daily ends up in my <a title="Pinboard" href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a> account.  In addition to this curation, I bookmark every relevant site and post I come across in my daily surfing using the Pinboard bookmarklet.</p>
<p>Using the <a title="Pinboard API" href="http://pinboard.in/api/">Pinboard API</a> I setup a news curation system at <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> which pulls my latest pinboards every 15 minutes and adds them to a curation queue which I monitor every couple hours.  My API Evangelist curation system allows me to add comments and tags, further adding meaning to what I&rsquo;ve already read throughout the day. Then using a combinations of tags, I route relevant news to&nbsp; <a title="API Evangelist" href="/news/">API Evangelist</a> and <a title="Hack Weekend News" href="http://www.hackweekends.com/news/">Hack Weekends</a>.</p>
<p>These curated links represent the daily reading and research that goes into my writing and industry reports.  I thought it would be good to share with you some of what I read on a daily basis, my random comments and insights, rather than just the final results.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/05/03/apis-help-deliver-on-early-visions-of-the-internet/">APIs Help Deliver on Early Visions of the Internet</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">03 May 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/internet-commerce.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As my professional career moved online during the years between 1995 and 2000, I had numerous visions about what the World Wide Web could do for businesses.  I think I shared these visions with millions of other individuals, fueling what we now know as the first Internet bubble.</p>
<p>I saw e-commerce driving entirely new businesses that could operate entirely online, and strengthen existing brick and mortar businesses allowing anyone to buy and sell goods and services from anywhere, instantly.</p>
<p>What we ended up with was still important, but the web 1.0 world was not quite as grand as I think some of us had envisioned.   <a title="E-Bay History of APIs" href="/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">E-Bay</a>, <a title="Amazon History of APIs" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a> and Paypal definitely went further than many e-commerce platforms and service providers, and I firmly believe their embrace of web APIs was the reason for this.</p>
<p>While e-commerce has undeniably grown and evolved, other new concepts like social and cloud computing took center stage in creating an entirely new vision of the Internet, concepts we didn&rsquo;t even conceive in the early days of the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>Years later, driven by APIs, I think we are just now beginning to deliver on the early visions of commerce on the Internet.  <a title="E-commerce APIs like ElasticPath" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/">E-commerce APIs like ElasticPath</a> are delivering on this vision by offering up a mature and robust <a title="e-commerce engine" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/products/features">e-commerce engine</a> completely accessible by a truly RESTful API.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/elasticpath/elasticpath-logo.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Using ElasticPath you can define and execute against any vision of commerce whether it involves physical or virtual goods, with any type of pricing, offers or subscriptions that enable purchasing of these products on truly any platform or any device, in a myriad of ways only limited by your imagination.</p>
<p>ElasticPath delivers by starting with a hardened and complete e-commerce engine that drives clients like Google and Sony, and proven by driving extreme online and offline commerce scenarios like the <a title="Vancouver Winter Olympics" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/company/news/2007/vancouver-2010-olympics">Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics</a>.  Next ElasticPath bundles a robust Level 3 REST API with the their e-commerce engine, providing not just programmatic access to every aspect of the e-commerce engine, but a hypermedia driven experience ensuring developers can deliver on the business logic and user experience defined by any company that deploys their e-commerce platform using ElasticPath.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elasticpath.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/elasticpath/elasticpath-api.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with Level 3 REST also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State</a> (HATEOAS), it is an enhancement to REST, that enables a client to have no prior knowledge about how to interact with any particular application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia.  So in the context of e-commerce, when a developer requests a product the API, you get back the usual JSON describing the product, but you also get supporting media types for these &ldquo;products&rdquo;, and supporting link relations.  So if purchasing the product means streaming in media player you will get media types as well as link to load into player, where if it is a product that you can add to shopping cart, you will get the link to add to cart, and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still learning about the technical details and benefits of HATEOAS REST, but i can see the benefits when bundled with ElasticPath&rsquo;s very mature e-commerce engine.  It allows you to not only build robust product catalogs that drive your website, but an e-commerce engine that can drive digital commerce across multiple platforms and devices, without developers having to fully understand the business rules and logic set forth by your company, leaving them to do what they do best, while ensuring your products, information and brand are reflected wherever your conducting e-commerce.</p>
<p>I guess e-commerce isn&rsquo;t the only vision of the Internet, but it definitely is a large part of it, and I think APIs have been fueling the growth of e-commerce since the first part of the last decade, and now with platforms like <a title="ElasticPath" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/">ElasticPath</a> we will truly see this vision mature and allow us to sell physical and digital goods anywhere in the world, in real-time.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/reaching_out.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>The best thing about owning <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> is I get to write about whatever I want.  I have full editorial control, and because of my unique view on the API space I tend to write about APIs from three separate perspectives:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>API Owner</li>
<li>API Service Provider</li>
<li>Developer</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the three main actors in the API game.  There are others, but these are the three viewpoints I write about the most.  I tend to rail on API owners a lot, and today I think I will rail on API developers.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m doing a lot of reaching out to my developers.  I personally email everyone who registers for CityGrid APIs.  Sure I use template emails, but I customize them and send the email one by one so I can <a title="profile my API developers" href="/2012/04/17/profiling-api-developers/index.php">profile my API developers</a> and understand what they are doing.</p>
<p>So far, my findings are that many developers don&rsquo;t have any sort of verifiable online persona, and even more don&rsquo;t bother responding when I email or tweet at them.  Its not my business to police the <a title="CityGrid APIs" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/">CityGrid APIs</a>, but I definitely apply a grade to every developer I look at, and make recommendations based upon this grade, where online persona and responsiveness are two big factors.</p>
<p>We hear a lot of developers (me included) complain about API owners not being responsive, but remember there is another side to the coin.  If you're using someone&rsquo;s API for FREE, and they take time out of their day to email you or tweet at you, it might be cool if you took 10 seconds to respond and say hello, and let them know you're an actual person.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><a title="deploying and managing APIs" href="http://www.3scale.net"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>At most <a title="Hackathons" href="/events/">hackathons</a>, the end goal is building a web or mobile application, using various platforms and APIs.  Even though I&rsquo;ve seen this evolve to data visualization, or mashing up SaaS platforms at some events, the app really tends to be the primary deliverable at hackathons.</p>
<p>So this week I&rsquo;m spending time thinking of unique and interesting ways to present my sponsors for the <a title="CityGrid hackathon this weekend in Santa Monica" href="http://citygridhackathonla.eventbrite.com/">CityGrid Hackathon this weekend in Santa Monica</a> at <a title="CoLoft" href="http://www.coloft.com/">CoLoft</a>.  One of our sponsors is <a title="3Scale API Service Provider" href="/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a>, one of my favorite API service providers, and while we see many of the API service providers including <a title="Apigee" href="/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a> and <a title="Mashery" href="/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a> involved in many of the hackathons you really don't see anything built using their platform. (I know they&rsquo;ll ping me and say they do, but really your building using their clients.)</p>
<p>So for the <a title="CityGrid Los Angeles Hackathon" href="http://citygridhackathonla.eventbrite.com/">CityGrid Los Angeles hackathon</a>, I want to encourage developers to come up with ideas for APIs, develop the API and using 3Scale, deploy the building block that are essential that enable other developers to build on top of the API.</p>
<p>Not only do we need more, high value APIs, we need developers to be fluent in not just developing and deploying mobile and web apps, developers need to be fluent in designing, developing, <a title="deploying and managing APIs" href="http://www.3scale.net">deploying and managing APIs</a>.</p>
<p>So if you have a great API idea and are in the Los Angeles area this weekend, come down to the CoLoft in Santa Monica and form a team and build your API, and deploy it using 3Scale, and you just might have a chance at winning $5,000.00 for your API.</p>

<p>One of my self-appointed roles in the API industry is to shed light on, and discuss the business of APIs when many other API owners and evangelists tend to keep their strategy and business closer to their chest.</p>
<p>Many API owners don&rsquo;t discuss their roadmaps, either because they feel they will be giving away their secret sauce, or quite possibly because they don&rsquo;t have a clue where they are going with it.  I think it&rsquo;s more the latter, as we are all making this shit up as we go along.</p>
<p>One subject you don&rsquo;t hear API owners discuss often, is when their API will be deprecated or shuttered, leaving developers and tech bloggers to speculate on the subject.  Because of this you tend to hear just the extreme views on the subject.  Popular perspectives on API life-span tends to be:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>APIs Are Forever - Once you put an API, you have to support it forever</li>
<li>APIs Can Go Away Anytime - There is no stability whatsoever when it comes to APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written on this subject several times including <a href="/2012/04/09/what-happens-to-instagram-api-developers-after-facebook-acquisition/">What Happens to Instagram API Developers After Facebook Acquisition</a> and <a href="/2011/05/28/building-your-business-around-google-or-any-other-apis/">Building Your Business Around Google or Any Other APIs</a>.</p>
<p>Even with my stance on the subject I fall prey to the hype sometimes.  I saw the post from Google today called <a href="http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2012/04/changes-to-deprecation-policies-and-api.html">Changes to deprecation policies and API spring cleaning</a>, and I immediately thought oh no, here we go again.  After reading deeper I realized they are updating their API deprecation policy for many popular APIs.  As they state:</p>
<blockquote><em>The new policy simply states that we will strive to provide one year notice before making breaking changes.</em></blockquote>
<p>Google is setting a clear window, for which they will make sure and give developers a heads up before deprecating an API.  This allows you to know that you can count on an API being around, until you hear otherwise, and then, you still have a year to figure out what you are going to do.</p>
<p>I know this is something other API owners do, but it rarely is something you hear any news about, giving the API extremists free range to use page view grabbing headlines about <a href="/2012/03/30/why-tech-bloggers-suck-and-not-apis/">APIs owners being no better than satan, and eat their developers for dinner</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to work on a more formal post about API deprecation policies, and how API owners can put them to use, setting better expectations around API life cycles.</p>

<p>One of the essential ingredients of a successful API, is a self-service area to support your API developers.  In my opinion this is a no-brainer.  You have to have registration, documentation, code samples, forum and other <a title="essential building blocks" href="/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">essential API building blocks</a> available to developers in a self-service way--so they can engage with your API 24/7 without asking for access.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked hard to make sure the CityGrid API area has a logical navigation, taking developers to the essential information they will need to learn about and integrate with the APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">

<p>I keep a regular flow of information going through the blog to make sure there is excellent SEO content, so developers can search for anything at Google, and the blog will support linking to whats relevant in the <a title="CityGrid Developer Center" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid Developer Center</a>.</p>
<p>Even with all of this, I still get some pretty basic questions like:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>I need PHP code samples?</strong> - Immediately available on the code samples page.</li>
<li><strong>What does the API cost?</strong> -  Says that it is FREE on Getting Started and FAQ.</li>
<li><strong>Can I save your data in my database? </strong>- Says it on the Usage Requirements</li>
<li><strong>Do I have to show your logo?</strong> - Says it on the Usage Requirements</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/building%20blocks.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>That is just the tip of the iceberg.   I&rsquo;ve posed this question before...<a title="Are there enough doers to make this whole API vision work?" href="/2012/02/13/are-there-enough-doers-for-this-api-vision-to-work/">are there enough doers in the world to make this whole API vision work?</a> It&rsquo;s hard to tell if its just my view, while in the pit of despair, or if it is just the way it is.</p>
<p>It seems like there will always be some users who need hand holding, and they refuse to read the self-service material available in the API area.  When I&rsquo;m hacking on an API, I always make sure I search exhaustively before I ask a question, but I&rsquo;m discovering a new breed of developers who won&rsquo;t search, won&rsquo;t ask questions--then when you reach out to them they&rsquo;ll ask for what they need, no matter how basic.</p>
<p>It seems, that self-service API resources are essential, but there will always be a segment of our audience who aren&rsquo;t quite doers, they need more hand-holding and information presented to them before they get what they need.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/developer-profiling.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>For the last couple weeks I&rsquo;m neck deep in getting to know the developers who already use the <a title="CityGrid Developers" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid APIs</a>.  I want a better understanding of who a developer is, what kind of business they have and what they are looking to get out of the API.</p>
<p>To find this out I start out profiling them socially using <a title="Rapportive" href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a>&nbsp;(which I plan on automating using the&nbsp;<a title="Full Contact API" href="http://www.fullcontact.com/">Full Contact API</a> as soon as I have more time) for the following information:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Twitter Profile</li>
<li>LinkedIn Account</li>
<li>Facebook Profile</li>
<li>Google + Profile</li>
<li>Github Profile</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually I know the URL of their website, but if I don&rsquo;t, I can extract from their email address or sometimes Rapportive will provide for me. I visit each developer&rsquo;s site and look for:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Blog w/ RSS Feed</li>
<li>Business Contact Email </li>
<li>Business Contact Form</li>
</ul>
<p>Next I build a quick one sentence description, telling me who they are and what they do.  I also assemble a comma separated list of keyword and key phrases that best represent what they do.</p>
<p>Before I&rsquo;m done looking around their site I take a picture of their home page, so I have a visual reference to go with the developer profile. The home page image can go further than just a logo sometimes.</p>

<p>I take all of this information, put it into a database, and connected it to a JQuery Carousel that allows me to watch a slideshow that walks me through the world of my developers, and watch like a TV channel.</p>
<p>This process not only gives me a 100K understanding my developer ecosystem, but helps me remember as much as I can about each developer.  From this I hope to better engage them on a daily basis as well as provide feedback to the CityGrid API roadmap based upon quality API developer segmentation.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://citygridhackathonla.eventbrite.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/citygrid-la-hackathon/citygrid-los-angeles.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently planning a 9 city hackathon tour, starting with the <a href="http://citygridhackathonla.eventbrite.com/">CityGrid Los Angeles Hackathon</a>, and following up with Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, NYC, Baltimore, New Orleans, and Austin.</p>
<p>The CityGrid Hackathon tour is meant to bring together commercial and civic hackers to build the next generation of apps we use in our everyday "local" lives.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to find a blend of developers, business, marketing and advertising folks that will come together and develop commercially viable ideas that can also make our cities better places to live.</p>
<p>So I'm looking for sponsors that really enhance the local theme of the event, so I started with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Local API Stack" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/tag/stack/">Local API Stack</a></strong> - These are APIs that I track on for CityGrid, providing direct value to local mobile and web app developers.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Mobile Back-end as a Service Providers" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/mobile-backend-as-a-service-roundup/">Mobile Back-end as a Service</a></strong> - Service providers that exclusively provide back-end platforms and tools for mobile developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy if all of these companies could provide the sponsorships that I need to support the event, but it probably won&rsquo;t be enough.  So I&rsquo;m looking elsewhere with some of the usual suspects like Amazon Web Services, Rackspace and Twilio.</p>
<p>Regardless of what my sponsor line-up looks like I think I will still provide a directory of local APIs for developers to use, so that they have a robust listing of high quality APIs to choose from when building their local web and mobile apps.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Apr 2012</span>
        <p>When I was a tech blogger for <a href="http://readwriteweb.com">ReadWriteWeb</a> and API-related news broke, we writers would often shudder. &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t use API in the headline,&rdquo; the argument in the newsroom went. It&rsquo;s the page-view-kiss-of-death. That&rsquo;s not because APIs aren&rsquo;t super-important or super-ubiquitous on the Web (they are both). It&rsquo;s because most &ldquo;<a href="http://cdixon.org/2010/01/22/techies-and-normals/">normals</a>&rdquo; don&rsquo;t know what they are or why they matter. They&rsquo;d rather click on a story that says &ldquo;101 Ways to Use Pinterest to Plan Your Wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The decision to cover APIs regularly on ReadWriteWeb and eschew stories that fall into the &ldquo;[Number] Ways to Use [Hot New Social Media Tool] to [Conduct a Seasonally-Relevant Activity]&rdquo; goes a long way to explain the popularity of RWW versus that of Mashable, incidentally.</p>
<p>Also incidentally: Pinterest <a href="http://tijn.bo.lt/pinterest-api">has an API</a>.</p>
<p>This all presents a bit of a challenge, of course, if I want to make an argument for my readers here about why APIs really matter in education. Do I frame the argument for &ldquo;normals&rdquo;? (Wait! HA! &ldquo;Normals&rdquo; don&rsquo;t read Hack Education!) Do I frame it for educators? Entrepreneurs? Technologists? The answer: hopefully all of the above.</p>
<h2 id="whatisanapi">What is an API?</h2>
<p>API stands for &ldquo;Application Programming Interface.&rdquo; At its most basic level, an API allows one app to talk to another app. It&rsquo;s the way in which Web and mobile technologies can open up their data and their software&rsquo;s functionality to others. It&rsquo;s how Zynga integrates its games with your Facebook profile. It&rsquo;s how websites handle accepting payments via Paypal and play YouTube videos. It&rsquo;s how Instagram can share your photos to Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and Tumblr.</p>
<p>Rather than having to export a file from one system, then import it into another, APIs allow programs to &ldquo;make calls,&rdquo; sending and receiving just the information they need just when they need it. Web APIs (also known as REST APIs) do this &ndash; well obviously &ndash; via the Web using the protocols of the Web (HTTP). But instead of returning HTML like a website does when you &ldquo;call&rdquo; it, Web APIs return XML or JSON &ndash; that is, machine-readable data that other apps and websites can make us of.</p>
<p>But enough with the tech&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="whydoesthismatterineducation">Why does this matter in education?</h2>
<p>Educational data is <a href="/2012/04/11/download-all-your-education-data-with-the-click-of-one-button/">stuck in silos</a>, something fostered by educational software &ndash; administrative and instructional &ndash; that makes it cumbersome at best and impossible at worst to move data in and out of systems. As a result, there&rsquo;s lots of extra clerical work that educators and administrators have to do &ndash; recreating rosters, copying grades, downloading CSVs, copying-and-pasting, and so on. All because educational apps and software do not, as a rule, talk to one another.</p>
<p>Student Information Systems don&rsquo;t know which level of Angry Birds students are on. (Um hello, don&rsquo;t laugh: <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/04/another-gravitational-experiment-in-angry-birds-space/">Angry Birds is science</a>!) A better example, perhaps: a school&rsquo;s SIS might not talk to the district&rsquo;s database or the state&rsquo;s records system. Parents probably don&rsquo;t get an automatic SMS when there&rsquo;s an attendance issue or library book due. Learning management systems don&rsquo;t automatically capture what or how far students have read in their e-readers or what they&rsquo;ve annotated.</p>
<p>These functionalities (and lots more) are possible when there are APIs, opening the door to all sorts of <em>real-time</em> connections between products, services, and systems that are currently impossible due to time constraints, burdensome download and data entry processes, and vendors who&rsquo;d prefer to maintain data lock-in.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/darcy_modified.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="wherearetheeduapis">Where are the EDU APIs?</h2>
<p>The absence of APIs from a lot of education applications, I&rsquo;d argue, is a good indication that we&rsquo;re still dealing in many cases with pre-Web era technologies (or at least a pre-Web era mindframe). Student information systems. Learning management systems. Educational software for your desktop computer. All pre-Web. And even newer versions of these older systems often carry forward this legacy of a world without Web (or hell, even Internet) connectivity.</p>
<p>APIs played a crucial part in the explosion of Web technologies. E-commerce. Social networking. Cloud computing. Now mobile computing. All facilitated by APIs. APIs have enabled companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Twitter to become <em>platforms</em>, allowing other developers to build on top of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Platforms&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t necessarily something we talk about in education, although they do exist and are being developed <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2011/10/13/the-race-to-platform-education/">with increasing frequency</a>. Google Apps for Education is certainly an example of one. <a href="http://edmodo.com">Edmodo</a> is attempting to carve a similar path, and with the release its API last month, I described the startup as making the move &ldquo;<a href="/2012/03/06/edmodo-makes-the-move-from-social-network-to-education-platform/">from social network to education platform</a>.&rdquo; Edmodo&rsquo;s and Google&rsquo;s APIs allows other companies &ndash; <a href="http://mathalicious.com">Mathalicious</a>, <a href="http://desmos.com">Desmos</a>, <a href="http://aviary.com">Aviary</a>, for example &ndash; to connect their apps to these platforms, tapping into rosters, roles, feeds, assignments, calendars, documents and so on.</p>
<p>The LMS could be a platform too, I suppose &ndash; <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/">and with APIs, that&rsquo;s the direction it could go</a>. But what&rsquo;s interesting to me is that, with their origins in a pre Web 2.0 world, LMSes have devised a separate standard to offer connections to external modules &ndash; &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/lti/">LTI</a>,&rdquo; not API. Is there widespread interest among third-party developers to integrate with LMSes via LTI? (To make the process simpler, <a href="https://lti-examples.heroku.com/index.html">Instructure co-founder Brian Whitmer has created a site</a> with examples and code samples.) Or will the pervasiveness of Web APIs mean that developers' interest goes elsewhere?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m veering dangerously back into the technical realm here &ndash; the type of discussions that, as I started this post, tend to make &ldquo;normals&rdquo; not read and not care about APIs.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re incredibly important, why we should pay attention to them in education, and why I recommend having an API is something you should look for in the tools you adopt: APIs make data accessible. APIs foster interoperability. APIs extend functionality. And APIs create an ecosystem -- of technology, of developers, of users. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We want that for ed-tech, don't we?</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/instagram.PNG" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was going to write this story when I got an email from <a title="Qwerly" href="http://qwerly.com/letter.html">Qwerly after they got acquired by Fliptop</a>, then after <a href="http://urbanairship.com/blog/2012/01/12/update-on-our-plan-to-integrate-location-and-context-services-into-our-push-messaging-platform/">SimpleGeo was acquired by Urban Airship</a>, then when I got the email from <a href="http://blog.indextank.com/1221/indextank-linkedin-acquires-indextank/">LinkedIn announcing they were shutting down IndexTank</a>.  Four acquisitions later, I&rsquo;m finally making time today after the announcement of <a title="Facebook Acquiring Instagram" href="http://tmblr.co/ZMPd3xJMuYI9">Facebook acquiring Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>So, what will happen to Instagram API developers, now that Instagram is owned by Facebook?  We don&rsquo;t know.  It <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/04/09/facebook-probably-wont-kill-the-instagram-api/">sounds like Facebook will keep Instagram in tact</a>, but who knows where it will go from here, where founder Kevin Systrom will take it, or Facebook will step in and make changes.</p>
<p>If your like <a title="Postagram" href="http://postagramapp.com/">Postagram</a>, you&rsquo;ve already diversified beyond the Instagram API and acknowledged that you need to offer more than what you can build off a single API provider.  We&rsquo;ve hear the cry of many developers when Twitter poaches from its ecosystem, <a title="Google decide to shutter Google Translate" href="/2011/05/28/building-your-business-around-google-or-any-other-apis/">Google decided to shutter Google Translate</a>, then quickly <a href="/2011/08/25/paid-version-of-google-translate-api/">decided to offer paid version</a>--it doesn&rsquo;t matter who your API provider is, nobody is immune from acquisition or their API service being shuttered.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask the question about Instagram API developers before the API haters, jump in and blame the API.  Its not about the API, its about the API owners acknowledging their API ecosystem exists, and its developers, and whether or not they have a solid business strategy that includes having multiple suppliers for their content and products.</p>
<p>Hopefully you are a developer that understands the APIs you use to power your web or mobile application are potential vendors that could stay around for the next 10 years, or they could go away tomorrow with the next billion dollar acquisition--and with the right business strategy, maybe you could walk away with $400 Million, with your 40% equity, when your killer app is acquired.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hacker-storytelling/ada-the-enchantress-of-numbers.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hacker-storytelling/ada-the-enchantress-of-numbers.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>A big part of API evangelism, is storytelling.  Storytelling about the API, the value it delivers, and the solutions it provides.  Through my own hacking on an API, engaging with developers via email, a forum and social media, I gather ideas for projects that would help evangelize an API, while also educating users of how it works.</p>
<p>One example is a recurring question I get from <a title="CityGrid API Developers" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid API developers</a>--how does CityGrid compare with other places APIs like Google Places and Yelp?</p>
<p>I set out to answer this question, quickly realizing it was easier said than done.  I found 11 places APIs that fit my criteria, and they had many differences, so I started by writing a quick <a title="overview of the 11 places apis" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/overview-of-11-places-data-apis/">overview of the 11 places APIs</a>.  This helped me identify and quickly understand what each places API delivered.</p>
<p>Then I realized that I needed to actually hack on each API to truly understand how they work, and develop enough of an understanding where I could compare them in detail.  To do this, I needed a project, to use as a anchor for my storytelling.  Not just one blog post, but many, with code samples and starter kits to help support the project.</p>
<p>I chose to build an <a title="Interactive Places API Comparison Tool" href="http://places-comparison-v1.hyp3rl0cal.com/index.php">Interactive Places API Comparison Tool.</a></p>
<p><a title="Interactive Places API Comparison Tool" href="http://places-comparison-v1.hyp3rl0cal.com/index.php"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CityGrid-Google-Yelp-1024x189.png" alt="" width="500" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>As a start, I chose 3 places APIs to compare:  <a title="CityGrid" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid</a>, <a title="Google" href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/">Google</a> and <a title="Yelp" href="http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview">Yelp</a>.  The Interactive Places API Comparison Tool provides a what and where textual search as well as a latitude and longitude search, simultaneously across the 3 APIs.</p>
<p>Once I built the first prototype I <a href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/interactive-places-api-comparison-for-citygrid-google-and-yelp/">blogged about the comparison tool for the first time</a>, as well as some of the research that went into it, like <a title="places api comparison" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/interactive-places-api-comparison-for-citygrid-google-and-yelp/">Places API request format comparison</a>--talking about how CityGrid, Google and Yelp each tailored their API requests.</p>
<p>Today I finished a report to support the what and where search and one for the latitude and longitude search.  The report shows what was searched for, how many listings were pulled from each API and number of images, offers, reviews and tips for each place returned.  I will be adding other reporting items in the future.</p>
<p>So far I&rsquo;ve produced a lot of quality content from this hacker storytelling project:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>5 Blog Posts</li>
<li>Interactive API Comparison Web Application</li>
<li>Code Samples for Searching and Pulling Places Detail for 3 APIs</li>
<li>Code Libraries for Each of the 3 APIs</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/hacker-storytelling/Hyp3rL0cal-Interactive-Places-API-Comparison-Tool-Listing.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>All blog posts are syndicated out to Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook as well as bookmarked at Reddit, StumbleUpon and Hacker News.  All code samples live as Github Gists so I can embed in blog posts and other places, while code libraries live as Github repositories.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to post a bew blog post about the Interactive Places API Comparison reports I just finished, and will be adding Factual and Foursquare to the list of APIs that are compared as part of the tool.  This will give me probably four or five more blog stories in the next couple days.</p>
<p>It is hard to tell where the project will go after that.  The good hacker storytelling projects just keep living and producing blog posts, code samples, code libraries and starter kits.  But there will always be new ideas for projects and stories when I engage with developers within the API community and on the open Internet.</p>

<p>While assembling the building blocks for a successful API ecosystem, one of the requests I get from developers is for tools to help them build successful integrations with existing platforms like Wordpress, Drupal, Facebook and Salesforce.</p>
<p>Some of the requests I get are from non-developers who just want a plug and play tool, they can deploy without needing to write code--but many of the requests are for white label, starter kits that developers can use to quickly deploy API driven applications on popular platforms like:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Wordpress" href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a></li>
<li><a title="Drupal" href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a></li>
<li><a title="Facebook" href="http://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a title="Salesforce" href="http://developer.force.com/">Salesforce</a></li>
<li><a title="Joomla" href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert in any of these platforms, but I find the more I dive into developing on these platforms, the more I learn and the more I discover other experts who really understand the ins and outs of building plugins and add-ons for 3rd party systems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to building code samples, code libraries and generic start kits for your API, you may want to take a look at building white label, 3rd party platform plugins and add-ons your developers can use to quickly integrate your API into existing networks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At the very least, you will learn a lot.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Mar 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-api.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I read a post over at <a title="Cloud Ave" href="http://www.cloudave.com/">Cloud Ave</a> today by Martijn Linssen, <a title="Why API&rsquo;s suck, and what they lack" href="http://www.cloudave.com/18470/why-apis-suck-and-what-they-lack/">Why API&rsquo;s suck, and what they lack</a>. &nbsp;I'll start by saying, everything he says about APIs, can be true for some APIs, but the post has more to do with the state of tech blogging, than anything to do with APIs.</p>
<p>To Linssen's points:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>First of all, API&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t open</strong> - True many APIs use this term, without it being true.  But those of in the industry who get it, call these "public" APIs and have stopped using the term "open".  Open has been used by a few bad marketing seeds, and perpetuated by the blogosphere.</li>
<li><strong>Second of all, API&rsquo;s are for free, mostly, and no uptime is guaranteed -</strong> What? Really?  Maybe the 10 you've tried don't, but many of the APIs I depend on do.  Just to name a few:&nbsp;<a title="Google Maps" href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/earthmaps/maps_sla.html">Google Maps</a>,&nbsp;<a title="WebServius" href="http://www.webservius.com/corp/sla.html">WebServius</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Datasift" href="http://datasift.com/terms/sla">Datasift</a>,&nbsp;<a title="http://zencoder.com/sla/" href="http://zencoder.com/sla/">Zencoder</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Amazon EC2" href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2-sla/Amazon S3">Amazon EC2</a>, <a title="Amazon S3" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3-sla/">Amazon S3</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Third, API&rsquo;s are badly documented, if any </strong>- Sure this can be a problem, and is something everyone is working on. This doesn't point to APIs sucking, more the documentation. &nbsp;Can you point me to the documentation you&rsquo;ve maintained?  Its&rsquo; not as easy as it looks.  And there are plenty of shining examples of how do you do it right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok those are your points?  And you went to <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> and looked at 10 APIs?  And you came to the conclusion all APIs suck?  I've spent hundreds of hours looking through ALL of the APIs in the ProgrammableWeb directory, and yes there is a lot of shit in there.  But there are some really amazing examples of the API vision, that you seem to be bothered by.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you hacked on <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>?  Twilio rocks!  Have you used <a title="Stripe" href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>?  Seen the forwarding thinking e-commerce APIs <a title="ElasticPath" href="http://www.elasticpath.com/">ElasticPath</a> is working on? Have you hacked on any of the 97+ Google APIs lately?  They have come a really long way in pulling together their interfaces, standardizing documentation, making legal easier to use, and standardizing what is free and what is billing.</p>
<p>Linssen seems caught up on the fact that all APIs are some sort of social bullshit.  I counter with the fact that the last 5 years of Internet growth has been build on the back of Amazon Web Services, via APIs.  When I started using both EC2 and S3, it was all APIs, there were no interfaces.  I&rsquo;ve deployed, scaled and supported global infrastructure with millions of dollars running through those APIs, personally.</p>
<p>My recommendation to Linssen is he spend more time hacking on APIs, and look at the playing field a little more before you professionally blog on the subject.  But that brings me back to my title, and the fact that his blog post is about page views, and not about APIs, which represents the state of tech blogosphere and not APIs.</p>
<p>I just went over to Techmeme and look at the top 10 stories, and I decided that all tech bloggers suck and I'll stop reading tech blogs all together.  Actually no..I'll keep doing what I do with all tech blogs, evaluate them one by one and unsubscribe when they stop offering value. Much like you should do with APIs.</p>

<p>The largest portion of my time as API Evangelist is spent keeping the area around an API active.  Your developer&rsquo;s first impression when they enter your API area is critical, and if they see signs that your API is inactive, they might start looking elsewhere.</p>
<p>The most common ways I keep an API active is by:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Blogging</li>
<li>Tweeting w/ Twitter Feature in API Area</li>
<li>Forum Posts</li>
<li>How-Tos</li>
<li>Starter Projects</li>
<li>Developer Showcase</li>
</ul>
<p>By actively posting content in these areas w/ timestamps showing when they were posted, I keep the API area looking like someone is home.</p>
<p>This active content doesn&rsquo;t just help developers visiting the site feel like the API is active, it also helps your SEO. Search engines and social networks will regularly index your content, providing fresh traffic, and potentially new developers to your API.</p>
<p>Just a couple hours a day, generating fresh content and engaging with your developers goes a long ways in attracting new developers and making them feel confident that your API is a priority, and they should integrate it into their applications.</p>

<p>With all the attention sexism in silicon valley has gotten, I wanted to make sure and showcase some positive news on the Hackathon front this week.</p>
<p>There was a great article in the Oregonian out of Portland called, "<a title="Intel 'Code for Good' hackathon helps nonprofits solve technology challenges" href="http://www.oregonlive.com/hillsboro/index.ssf/2012/03/intel_code_for_good_hackathon.html">Intel 'Code for Good' hackathon helps nonprofits solve technology challenges</a>".</p>
<p>The theme for the hackathon: <strong>Girls in education</strong></p>
<p>Code for Good co-organizer Josh Bancroft worked with co-organizer Renee Kuriyan and employees in Intel's corporate affairs group to help four nonprofit organizations, <a href="http://www.worldpulse.com/">World Pulse</a>, a Portland-based nonprofit; <a href="http://www.roomtoread.org/">Room to Read</a>; <a href="http://10x10act.org/">10X10: Educate Girls Change the World</a>; and <a href="http://www.campaignforeducation.org/">Global Campaign for Education</a>.</p>
<p>"I felt like we could amplify the impact" by software and corporate working together, Bancroft said. The partnerships were already established by corporate affairs, and the software group simply brought the technical expertise.</p>
<p>Their task was to create software solutions to real-world problems facing girls in education, and for each team to develop an app by the end of the day that the nonprofits could then put to use. The hackathon theme is part of <a href="http://www.intel.com/shewill">Intel's "She Will"</a> campaign and with the company's overarching mission to "create and extend computing technology to connect and enrich the lives of every person on Earth."</p>
<p>You can read more about the great hackathon over at <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/hillsboro/index.ssf/2012/03/intel_code_for_good_hackathon.html">Oregon Live</a>.&nbsp;I just wanted to point out that not all hackathons are male dominated, and the model can go much further than some of what we see coming out of Silicon Valley.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/linkedin/linkedin-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Every Monday I generate a list of all new API developer who registered for the&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid&nbsp;API</a>&nbsp;the week before.  This list has the name and email address for each developer, and I manually go down the list, and email them individually, letting them know I&rsquo;m here to help.</p>
<p>As I email each new API developer I use <a href="/2012/01/23/engaging-my-api-developers-immediately-with-rapportive/">Rapportive to identify more information about them</a>, such as their website URL, Twitter and LinkedIn profile.  If a developer has a Twitter or LinkedIn profile, I engage them on those networks.</p>
<p>After 3 months of doing this, I&rsquo;ve noticed that developers who work for larger companies have LinkedIn profiles and developers who either are freelance, own or work with a smaller development shop tend to have Twitter.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/twitter-logo-puffy-border.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>It makes sense.  Twitter is a more public forum, and smaller companies tend to need to market their skills and services and actively engage the world around them.  While established companies tend to keep their developers in a more closed environment, suitable for the business social network LinkedIn.</p>
<p>This type of information helps me segment my API developer audience into various groups allowing me to craft blog posts, announcements and share other information with them on appropriate channels.  I&rsquo;m not a big fan of emailing, so being able to push out information regularly on LinkedIn and Twitter, and engage with users that are active on these networks, works very well for supporting my approach to API developer support.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Mar 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/tag-cloud-hackathon.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time trying to track on what gets created at <a title="hackathons" href="/events/">hackathons</a>. &nbsp;Some innovative programming occurs at these events and I&rsquo;d say 98% of it is forgotten by Monday morning.</p>
<p>I think a lot of attention is given to the myth that hackathons are about building startups.  When in reality, how many startups come out of hackathons?  In my opinion the top three things that come out of a hackathon are:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Marketing</strong> - For the event organizer, sponsors and for participants. </li>
<li><strong>Talent Acquisition</strong> - There is some seriously talented folks attending hackathons. </li>
<li><strong>Networking</strong> - Hackathons are a great place to meet people, network, make friends and sure maybe a co-founder. </li>
</ol>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Beyond that I think there is a lot of code that gets generated at hackathons, that really never goes anywhere.  Much of this code is not immediately VC fundable, but still some of it is really good.  And I see a lot of kids spending whole weekends writing the same or similar code as I saw the weekend before.</p>
<p>To help remedy this, I suggest that event organizers use&nbsp;<a title="Github" href="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github-logo.png">Github</a>.  Just like every <a href="/2012/01/08/hashtag-for-your-hackathon/">hackathon organizer should identify a Twitter #hashtag</a> for the event, you should setup a Github organization and add your hackers as users.  Encourage them to commit their code through-out the hackathon, and wrap up the weekend with a nice README file of their project.</p>
<p>Seems like a great way to showcase what was built over the weekend, make the intellectual property open and accessible for other people to use, and make it easier for other hackathon participants to build off what has already been created in the past.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2012</span>
        <p>Boston API Jam organizer Sqoot just got themselves into a lot of hot water with some very sexist comments on their hackathon home page (now removed):</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/sqoot/boston-api-jam.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>From what I can tell, Sqoot was called out by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/BoazSender">@BoazSender</a>:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/sqoot/Sqoot-Boaz-Sender-.png" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p>Then the pressure quickly was put on in the Twittershpere:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/sqoot/sqoot-jacobian.png" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p>Resulting in Apigee pulling their sponsorship:</p>

<p>And Heroku pulling theirs as well:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/sqoot/sqoot-heroku.png" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tCdfaMOC2xmx9LFsn7At_34uabeqjqaB4mbNjj1j4N8/preview?pli=1&amp;sle=true">Sqoot quickly released an "apology"</a> which included:</p>
<blockquote><em>"While we thought this was a fun, harmless comment poking fun at the fact that hack-a-thons are typically male-dominated, others were offended."</em></blockquote>
<p>Their "apology" definitely summarizes the misogynistic tone of the spreading Silicon Valley startup and hackathon culture.</p>
<p>This is a major problem.  One of my biggest complaints about many hackathons is that they are male dominated, and this is nothing to joke about, make fun of or take lightly.  You don&rsquo;t realize it when all you do is attend the all boy hackathons and do your bro-gramming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to hackathons where there are equal sexes, and they are awesome-- way more fun, and truly work to solve real life problems, not perceived problems.</p>
<p>I hope other blogs will publicize this, and make other hackathon organizers aware so this kind of shit doesn&rsquo;t not only go away, but we start working the other direction and making sure <strong>EVERYONE</strong> feels welcome at hackathons.</p>

<p>My recommendation to API owners is to always have a blog, however one the most damaging things you can do is stop posting to your blog.  A blog is a key variable in my <a title="API Stack Algorithm" href="/2012/03/15/qualifying-for-the-api-stack/">API Stack algorithm</a>, of whether or not an API is worth integrating with, and if you haven&rsquo;t updated your blog anytime in the last year, I immediately step away.</p>
<p>If you want people to find your API, have a blog.  If you want your existing developers to be educated about what can be done with your API, have blog.  If you want developers who find your API, to feel confident enough to integrate it into their app, keep you blog updated!</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.geoiq.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/geoiq/geoiq-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going through hundreds of APIs and curating a list of APIs, for what I&rsquo;m calling the API Stack. &nbsp;The API Stack consists of APIs that provide clear value for developers and have demonstrated real investment in their API, and are in it for long haul.</p>
<p>There are quite a few things I consider when looking at an API, here are a few:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Value</strong> - The API offers clear value to developers, without needing an explanation.</li>
<li><strong>Web API</strong> - They don&rsquo;t have to be 100% REST, but web APIs make developers lives easier.</li>
<li><strong>Active Blog w/ RSS</strong> - A blog is a quick way to see what is behind the curtain of an API.  If they care enough to have a blog, and communicate with developers, and keep it active it demonstrates they care.  With an RSS feed I can programmatically understand whether they are active or not.</li>
<li><strong>Active Forum w/ RSS</strong> - A forum gives developers a voice and also shows an API owner cares what developers thinks, and is willing to support a large community.  An active forum is a positive sign of an API, and the RSS feed also gives me a programmatic way to assess.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - An active Twitter presence is a pretty key metric in understanding the value of an API.  If the company has the resources to actively engage developers via Twitter, they care.  And again I can programmatically monitor and see if someone exists behind the API.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other metrics I use, but these are proving to be the most positive characteristics of an API that developers can depend on.  Many APIs I come across don&rsquo;t even meet these basic requirements.  What triggered this post, was I had just looked at about 10 APIs that did not meet these basic requirements, and then I came across one that clearly met all of these, and more--<a href="http://www.geoiq.com/">GeoIQ</a>.</p>
<p>GeoIQ has a mapping API that provides clear value to developers, and its obvious they are investing the necessary resources, so the API is successful.  So I&rsquo;m adding GeoIQ to my API stack under the category of &ldquo;local&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If you feel your API is a good fit for the API stack, make sure and ping me.</p>

<p>Social Data Analyzing API <a title="Knodes" href="http://knod.es/">Knodes</a> has just announced a $250K startup fund that will invest in the best products, websites and applications built on top of the Knodes API platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://knod.es/hot/dev">Knodes Social Data Analyzing API</a> provides developers with social data-based insights about their users across social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>With the launch of the Fund, the Knodes team is hoping to bring awareness to their API and jumpstart a new ecosystem of developers, businesses and campaigns whose next generation social applications will be powered by its API.</p>
<p><a href="http://knod.es/hot/fund">The Knodes Fund</a> which is in partnership with <a title="Quotidian Ventures" href="http://quotidianventures.com/">Quotidian Ventures</a>, will take the best websites, web and mobile applications and give them the resources they need to be successful, including up to $25,000 in equity funding, mentorship and access to new features and social intelligence available via the Social Data Analyzing API.</p>
<p>The Knodes Fund is open to all individuals and companies building an application, website or program using the Knodes API.  Applications can be submitted at Knod.es beginning May 1, 2012, and the deadline to apply for the Knodes Fund is June 1, 2012.</p>

<p><a href="http://se.linkedin.com/in/andreaskrohn">Andreas Krohn</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://twitter.com/andreaskrohn">@andreaskrohn</a>)&nbsp;first saw the potential of APIs when he in 2005 started working with enterprise web scraping solutions at <a href="http://kapowsoftware.com/">Kapow Technologies</a> (now Kapow Software). Conceptualizing the web as one big database and creating APIs to get to that data is not that different from the REST APIs used today. When leaving Kapow to start his own <a href="http://dopter.se">company</a> it was a given that the focus would be on APIs and open data.</p>
<p>Andreas API work is focused in Sweden where he regularly speaks at conferences. Mostly he focuses on the non-technical side of APIs since APIs are doomed to fail without a good business strategy and long term marketing plan. The ones that really need to understand the potential of APIs are the business people and then focusing on the money instead of technology is the way forward. He is also providing consulting services customers regarding API strategies and technologiesone such project he has been active in is <a href="http://trafiklab.se">Trafiklab</a> which is a portal for Swedish public transport APIs. The goal of the project is to collect Swedish travel related APIs in one place with consistent documentation, API-key handling and support to make them as attractive to developers as possible.</p>
<p>He writes about APIs on Swedens leading API blog <a href="http://www.mashup.se">Mashup.se</a> and has done so for several years. The focus of Mashup.se is international API news as well as highlighting local Swedish APIs. To increase the use of Swedish APIs he has recently launched the <a href="http://www.mashup.se/apikatalog">Swedish API directory</a> listing over 200 Swedish APIs. Not much compared to the 5000+ APIs listed on <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a>, but a lot for a small country where the wave of APIs are just getting started. The development of APIs in Sweden is currently lead by government agencies and agencies due to European Union directives but Andreas hopes that showing the available private APIs will lead to a wider use of APIs and more private companies developing APIs.</p>

</p>
<p>
     <em>This post comes from the <a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://sdkbridge.com/">SDK Bridge</a> newsletter.  I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you.</em>
</p>
<p>
     People are constantly trying to come up with tools to make API documentation an easier task. If you are documenting an SDK built for C++, C#, or Java, there are tools such as Doxygen, Sandcastle, and JavaDocs to take comments from the code and automatically generate documentation from them. Why aren't there tools like this for REST APIs?
</p>
<p>
     The beauty of Web APIs is that they can be written in whatever language you like and in whatever manner you like. As long as when an HTTP request comes in, the proper HTTP response goes out, it doesn't matter how it actually happens on the server. But this very flexibility makes automated documentation nearly impossible, since there's no standard mapping between what an API request is and what the code is that generates its response.
</p>
<p>
     Nonetheless, there are some solutions out there to this problem. I need to start by saying that there are in fact two approaches to automation that are used to document REST APIs. One is similar to the tools I mentioned above, where comments are taken from code to generate the documentation. The other involves having the documentation separate from the code, but in a data format (such as JSON) that can be parsed and used to generate the documentation.
</p>
<p>
     I also should mention that documentation automation does not guarantee good documentation. Before choosing to to incorporate automation into your process, I recommend reading an excellent article by Dana Fujikawa: <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/t/" target="_blank">What to Consider Before Considering Auto-Generated Documentation</a>.
</p>
<h3>
     Automated Documentation from Code
</h3>
<p>
     There's no off-the-shelf tool that pulls documentation comments out of code that's going to work for all REST APIs. But there are two possible solutions:
</p>
<ol class="manliest">
     <li>Use a framework that both generates the APIs and the documentation
     </li>
     <li>Create methods with a one-to-one mapping with API requests.
     </li>
</ol>
<p>
     <strong>Framework.</strong> A good example of a REST API framework is <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/i/" target="_blank">Enunciate</a>. Enunciate is an open-source Java-based Web API framework. It creates full HTML documentation of the services it generates, where the documentation is assembled from JavaDocs comments.
</p>
<p>
     <strong>Mapping.</strong> Mapping requires some disciplined practices, but has the advantage that it can be used with any technology. In this case, you need to create public methods that map directly to API requests. So, for example, you might have an API request to get a brief user profile for a user with an ID of 23423 with a call like this:
</p>
<p>
     <code>GET <a href="http://api.example.com/users/23423/profile?type=brief" target="_blank">http://api.example.com/users/23423/profile?type=brief</a></code>
</p>
<p>
     When this request comes in, you need to structure your code so that it calls a method by the name of something like:
</p>
<p>
     <code>public get_users__id__profile(int id, string profile_type)</code>
</p>
<p>
     Note that the <code>id</code> is surrounded by double underlines, indicating that it is not literally the text "id".
</p>
<p>
     This method would then have comments that could be picked up by automated tool, such as JavaDoc, RDoc, or Sandcastle, and HTML documentation would be generated. Then you would need to run the HTML documentation through an automated process that would remove unnecessary information (such as class names), and convert the method names, replacing single underlines with slashes and double underlines with slashes and brackets so that
</p>
<p>
     <code>public get_users__id__profile</code>
</p>
<p>
     would become
</p>
<p>
     <code>GET /users/{id}/profile</code>
</p>
<p>
     The parameters table would also need some modification so that it's clear which parameters are part of the URL and which are query parameters.
</p>
<p>
     It's not a simple process, but I have seen it done successfully using Ruby code and <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/d/" target="_blank">RDoc</a>.
</p>
<h3>
     Automated Documentation from Structured Data
</h3>
<p>
     The advantage of taking comments from code is that if there are changes in the code, the comments are more likely to be updated. However, a simpler and very flexible solution is to have the documentation in structured data (JSON or XML), and then have an automated process create the actual HTML documentation from it. There are a several tools that will do this, merging documentation with an ability to try out the REST calls, which is extremely handy. Here are some examples.
</p>
<p>
     <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/h/" target="_blank">Swagger</a>. Swagger is a tool created by Worknik that creates very nice looking API documentation with the ability to easily try any API request. You specify a resource discovery URL which returns JSON with information about the various REST resources, then for each resource, you specify the type of operation, the path, the potential errors, and the response. Although you are limited in how long your descriptions can be, it creates a very nice documentation system for straight-forward APIs.
</p>
<p>
     <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/k/" target="_blank">I/O Docs</a>. I/O Docs is a tool created by <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/u/" target="_blank">Mashery</a> that is very similar to Swagger. The big difference is that it is open source. Written in JavaScript, the source is available on github, which means that you can taylor it to your own needs, as well as look-and-feel.
</p>
<p>
     <strong>Create your own</strong>. If neither of these tools are flexible enough for your API, you can create your own. A beautiful implementation that I had the priviledge to work on was created by <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/o/" target="_blank">Tendril</a>. Take a look at an example API request at <a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/dyiukjk/hdhyyhjli/b/" target="_blank">Cost and Consumption for a Single Device</a>. You can see how you can try it out on the first tab, but then other tabs list parameters, response, and notes. By creating their own system, they were able to document a fairly complex API call which would not have worked with an off-the-shelf system.
</p>
<h3>
     Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
     Automated REST API documentation can be used to:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Keep the documentation near the code so that it's easier to update.
     </li>
     <li>Allow developers to try out of the API requests as part of the documentation.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Although it is impossible to have a tool that automatically generates REST API documentation from any code, there are a number of approaches that will let you autogenerate the documentation, including:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Using a framework that generates both the API code and its documentation.
     </li>
     <li>Creating a mapping between methods and API requests and using standard documentation tools.
     </li>
     <li>Writing documentation as structured data and generating HTML from it.
     </li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for new, relevant ideas to write blog posts on for the <a title="CityGrid Developer Blog" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/">CityGrid Developer blog</a>.  I have several topics I write about regularly including new projects I&rsquo;m working on, new releases around the API, and what I find during my local, mobile and social landscape analysis.</p>
<p>However it can be hard to find topics to write about that are relevant to CityGrid developers, or publishers as we call them.  To help write blog posts that are useful to my API community I started harvesting ideas and topics from actual forum posts from developers.</p>
<p>Earlier today a publisher submitted a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/citygrid-dev-talk/6x4j2g5Mqso">forum post stating their concerns about the age of some of the reviews</a> they get along with businesses, when making requests against the <a title="CityGrid Places API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API">CityGrid Places API</a>.  It was an easy question to answer, since CityGrid also provides a <a title="business reviews API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Reviews+API">business reviews API</a>, that will give you more control how you can pull reviews for a zip code, neighborhood or specific business.</p>
<p>Using the topic that was posted on the forum I was easily able to <a title="create a quick blog post" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/more-control-over-citygrid-review-api-requests/">create a quick blog</a> post framing the question and providing a detailed answer explaining how the CityGrid Reviews API provides a solution.</p>
<p>Now CityGrid publishers can potentially be exposed to this solution via the blog, RSS feed and since I actively syndicate my blog posts, they will see it if they follow CityGrid on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and also using a search engine.</p>
<p>When evangelizing for an API, I feel it is important to try and provide as helpful content as you can via an active blog presence, while also reverberating it across the multitude of channels your developers might be listening on--turning relevant forum posts into stories is a great way to do this.</p>

        <p>Since starting as <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> here at <a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygrid.com">CityGrid</a>, I have been asked a couple of times how we stack up against other places APIs. So I went through the 11 other places APIs, gathering info, in an attempt to see what each offered.</p>

     <a title="Foursquare API" href="https://developer.foursquare.com"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/foursquare/foursquare_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I am going through the <a title="Foursquare API" href="https://developer.foursquare.com">Foursquare API</a>, and found their section about how to get an increase in the number of calls you can make against the Foursquare API interesting:
</p>
<p class="c2">
     <em>If your application runs into any of our rate limits and you think you could use more, write us at api@foursquare.com. We'llneed your OAuth consumer id, an explanation about why you need an increased cap, and information about the following</em> 
</p>
<ul class="c3">
     <li>
          <em><strong>Usage</strong>: A description of the endpoints you're calling and how you're using the data retrieved. We use this to make sure you're abiding by our <a href="https://foursquare.com/legal/api/platformpolicy">Platform Policies</a> and <a href="https://foursquare.com/legal/terms">Terms of Service</a>. Sample requests are generally helpful.</em>
     </li>
     <li>
          <em><strong>Attribution</strong>: Screenshots of your application so we can confirm you're <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/attribution.html">attributing</a> foursquare correctly.</em>
     </li>
     <li>
          <em><strong>Caching</strong>: Cache venue details where appropriate to avoid making spurious requests to our servers. See theRetention section of our <a href="https://foursquare.com/legal/api/platformpolicy">Platform Policies</a> for more details.</em>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I like the idea of rewarding developers with the ability to make more calls against your API, when they adhere to your terms of service and benefit your operations.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/02/26/what-is-api-evangelist/">What is API Evangelist?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">26 Feb 2012</span>
        <p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-API-Evangelist.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     <strong><a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a></strong> has grown beyond being just a research blog. It is time for me to update the <a title="about us page" href="/about.php">about us page</a>, and its time for me to tell the story of what is "API Evangelist", and how I view my role in the API industry.
</p>
<p>
     API Evangelist started in July 2010. I was burning out in my job as VP of Technology for an events management company that managed events for SAP and Google. I was looking for a way to re-invent myself, doing something that I enjoyed, but also keep me employed for the next 5 years or more. I was looking for something that I was knowledeable about, would be around for a few years. I quickly identified web APIs as this focus.
</p>
<p>
     Web APIs had been a big part of my career since the early 2000’s. I’ve designed and consumed a lot of APIs, and they were the glue in a platform I built for my web development company Original Web Solutions, which I ran from 2000 through 2008.  But I also saw web APIs as vital, but quiet player in the growth of the Internet:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Social</strong> - Web APIs grew up along with social platforms like Flickr, Delicous, Twitter and Facebook.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Cloud</strong> - Web APIs came of age, with proving they could deploy IT infrastructure via Amazon Web Services, and are the power driving Paas and Saas.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Mobile</strong> - Web APIs are becoming ubiquitous with the growth of iOS, Android, Blackbery and Windows mobile phone usage.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     This locked it in for me. APIs were not only growing, they were going to be around for a while. So I started API Evangelist, and began researching the space, looking for a way that I could make not only a career, I could also make an impact.
</p>
<p>
     I set out, researching the space. I evaluated over 200 of the top web APIs, and wanted to understand their approach, why they were successful (or not), and who were movers and shakers in the space. I quickly saw that there were plenty of technical pundits or <span><em>RESTafarians</em></span>, who had strong opinions on technically how to deploy your APIs, but there very few people addressing the business side of API deployment and management.
</p>
<p>
     This was my angle. I would focus on the <a title="Business of APIs" href="/business_of_apis.php">business of APIs</a>, and study the approach, and building blocks that were used by successful API owners. By the end of 2010, I had my focus, and in 2011 I spent a lot of time getting to know the space, and the key players in the API industry. I met influencers such as John Musser(<a title="John Musser" href="https://twitter.com/#!/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>) of <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a>, Daniel Jacobson(<a title="Daniel Jacobson" href="https://twitter.com/#!/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>) of Netflix, Steven Willmott(<a title="Steve Willmott" href="https://twitter.com/#!/njyx">@njyx</a>) of <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net/">3Scale</a> and Sam Ramji(<a title="Sam Ramji" href="https://twitter.com/#!/sramji">@sramji</a>) of <a title="Apigee" href="http://apigee.com/">Apigee</a>.
</p>
<p>
     Throughout 2011 I developed my voice and approach to the space by blogging on <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a> and API Evangelist and being the API Evangelist for <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a>. In 2012 I feel this has moved beyond research and out of the PHD period, after 2 years exclusively focusing on the space, i feel like its a full-time career now. My role is <span class="c2">not</span> as "API Guru" as many people are quick to say, I see it as "API Luminary". All I do is shine light on what other really smart people are doing in the space, and thanks to my girlfriend Audrey Watters (<a title="Audrey Watters" href="https://twitter.com/#!/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>), I’m learning to shine the light by telling stories. Stories about the power of web APIs, and how they are transforming businesses and entire industries.
</p>
<p>
     This is my story of how I became the API Evangelist. Though I have worked to build a brand around the title, I’m not the only one out there. With the growth of APIs, there are many more API evangelist, developer evangelist and developer advocates popping up. I want to help give them a platform for telling their story of how they got where they are, and their vision of the API Industry.
</p>
<p>
     Here are a few of those stories:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Garrett Willkin - API Evangelist" href="/garrett_wilkin_api_evangelist.php">Garrett Wilkin - API Evangelist</a></strong>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     If you are an aPI evangelist, developer evangelist or developer advocate, and would like to share your story, email me at <a title="info@apievangelist.com " href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">info@apievangelist.com</a> and I’ll publish your story here.
</p>
<p>
     This blog is no longer just about me, its grown larger than that. Its become about the power of change by using web APIs, the people who are implementing that change, and the businesses and industries that are being transformed.

        <span class="post-date">26 Feb 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>When new users sign up for the <a title="CityGrid API" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com">CityGrid API</a>, I immediately get an email with their name, email and phone number, which are required for registration.  The API is self-service, and I rely on the <a title="essential building blocks" href="/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">essential building blocks</a> I&rsquo;ve assembled as part of the API area to support them in their first hours and days of integration.</p>
<p>Five days after registration, if a publishers has not reached out to the CityGrid API team, or show any usage on the API, I reach out to them via email, asking if there is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANYTHING</span></strong> I can do to make their integration successful.  I do not send an email blast, I email them one by one, and as I do this, <a title="I use rapportive in Gmail to identify if they have a twitter, linkedin or google+ account" href="/2012/01/23/engaging-my-api-developers-immediately-with-rapportive/">I use Rapportive in my Gmail to identify if they have a Twitter, Google+ or LinkedIn</a> account.  I then send a personal email, and follow them on their social networks and research their business web site, if they have one.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/LinkedIn.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say about 65% of my API users that are responsive, reply and tell me they are planning on integrating and just need more time or are waiting for the development resources to free up and then they&rsquo;ll tackle integration.  These are perfect candidates for social media, and because they are responsive they tend to follow me back on Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+.  Since I keep my social networks active on a daily basis, hopefully they&rsquo;ll see regular, informative posts from me, demonstrating not only is there a person behind the curtain at the CityGrid API, that I am actually investing in their success.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-plus/google_plus.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></p>
<p>New registrations are only one of my API success metrics.  My ultimate goal is to have them actively consuming the <a title="Places API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API">Places</a>, <a title="Reviews API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Reviews+API">Reviews</a> and <a title="Offers API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Offers+API">Offers</a> API and making money using <a title="CityGrid Mobile and Web Advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Ads+by+CityGrid">CityGrid Mobile and Web Advertising</a> and <a title="Places that Pay" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+that+Pay">Places that Pay</a>. &nbsp;To&nbsp;convert users from new to active users, I have to stay engaged with them, and I couldn&rsquo;t do this without the use of social media.</p>

<p>He feels passionately about the opportunities for collaboration and innovation that are being produced through the API trend of recent years. &nbsp;He recently attended and&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/11/09/i-fell-into-a-burning-ring-of-fire-at-music-hackday/">participated in the hacking at Music Hack Day</a>&nbsp;in Boston. Having been inspired by the electric, creative energy at this event, he&rsquo;s seeking further engagement with the wider hacking community.</p>
<p>As a writer for ProgrammableWeb since March 2011 Garrett has written&nbsp;<a href="http://programmableweb.com/profile/garrettwilkin">more than 100 articles</a>&nbsp;on APIs and the strategies behind them. Because of their shared passion for creativity and innovation, he enjoys engaging the technical and business leadership from these companies in discussing their niche in the API space.</p>
<p>His latest web technology project seeks to use Twilio to bridge the technology gap in rural communities where many people lack familiarity with or access to the web. &nbsp;Seeing value in the wisdom and cultural perspectives of these people who do not participate in our digital age, he hopes to use the old fashioned phone to facilitate their involvement.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Feb 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/api-craft"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/API-Craft-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>I'm a member of a Google group called <a title="API Craft" href="http://groups.google.com/group/api-craft">API Craft</a>.  There are some really smart API folks talking about everything from API deployment to API business strategies there. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The other day someone in the groups asked:</p>
<blockquote><em><strong>How does someone measure success in developing and deploying a public&ndash;facing Web API?</strong></em></blockquote>
<p>Scott Regan (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/scottregan">@scottregan</a>) of <a title="Apigee" href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a> gave a great response, and I wanted to share with everyone here.  Scott&rsquo;s suggestions for measurements were:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> - For public APIs, could be affiliate program revenue, ad revenue, or if incremental traffic from apps to the website has a known monetization rate</li>
<li><strong>Reach</strong> -  Incremental new user accounts or unique users</li>
<li><strong>Partnerships</strong> - Number of new partnerships established around your API</li>
<li><strong>Apps</strong> - The number of new apps developed using your API</li>
<li><strong>Traffic</strong> - Apply percentage of incremental traffic ("our API channel is now X% of total internet traffic")</li>
<li><strong>Brand</strong> - Measuring increased 'brand', but only if the company has an really established way to do this</li>
</ul>
<p>Scott goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote><em>When it comes to business metric tracking one thing i've seen work well is when the  API team publishes a 'dashboard'  widely and regularly -   tracking actual results to estimates  -   because it helps PM focus the roadmap on what moves the business needle as agreed and avoid getting the team pulled in different directions.</em></blockquote>
<p>Each API could potentially have different success factors depending on the type of API or the goals of a company.  But revenue, reach, partnerships, apps, traffic and increased brand awareness are good places to start. &nbsp;Thanks Scott.</p>

<p>I first wrote about <a title="interactive API documentation with Posterous's new API area" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/deploying-smarter-api-documentation/">interactive API documentation with Posterous&rsquo;s new API area</a> in June 2011, then the follow-up when&nbsp;<a title="Mashery deploying their own version called I/O docs" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/07/26/mashery-delivers-smarter-api-documentation/">Mashery deployed their own version called I/O Docs</a> in July 2011.</p>
<p>Smart, interactive or I/O API documentation is an evolution of API documentation from static and often boring documentation, to more interactive and real-time experience, allowing you to make live calls against an API while also browsing the documentation that explains how it operates.</p>
<p>Peter Gruenbaum of <a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/">SDK Bridge</a> has surveyed and done exhaustive research on <a title="what developers say about API documentation" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/20/what-developers-say-about-api-documentation/">what developers say about API documentation</a> and <a title="web api documentation best practices" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/08/12/web-api-documentation-best-practices/">web API documentation best practices</a>, proving that up to date, and complete documentation can be very successful in helping developers get up and running using an API.</p>
<p>The <a title="API Service Provider" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/">API Service Provider</a>, <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a> has stepped up with their own interactive API documentation for users of their platform using <a title="Swagger" href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a>, an open-source framework that lets developers learn, play, test and debug each element of an API in real-time.</p>
<p>There are 3 main benefits for API owners coming from adopting <a title="Swagger" href="/2011/11/09/can-swagger-deliver-a-restful-api-discovery-service/">Swagger</a>:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Automated, consistent generation of clean, beautiful, interactive API documentation</li>
<li>Generation of client code and SDK in Scala, Java, Javascript, Ruby, PHP, and Actionscript 3</li>
<li>Feeding into an industry wide API discovery language that both developers and non-developers can use</li>
</ul>
<p>While many companies are providing <a title="API Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/api_explorer.php">API explorers</a> for their developers to make live calls against their APIs, I think interactive documentation holds more value in educating developers about APIs, while also allowing them to make real-time calls.  My feeling is that this makes some tough concepts stickier while trying to understand and integrate with an API.</p>
<p>Visit the <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a> site for more information on using their <a title="API management platform for deploying interactive documentation" href="http://www.3scale.net/2012/01/24/interactive-api-documentation-the-new-api-console-for-developers/">API management platform for deploying interactive documentation</a>, using Swagger, for your APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> &nbsp;I have consulted with 3Scale on industry strategy several times.</p>

<p>Much of the work I get as an <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> starts with a review of an API area.  I have evolved a way to look at API areas, and identify which building blocks are present or missing, all contributing to the success or failure of an API.</p>
<p>I started evolved this methodology in summer of 2012 when I was first building API Evangelist, by reviewing over 250+ of the top APIs out there.  I generated a list of the common building blocks used by APIs, as well as identified a bunch of innovative and less commonly used <a title="Building Blocks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">building blocks</a>.</p>
<p>When I first started working with <a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygrid.com">CityGrid</a> I reviewed their API area, which contained the following building blocks:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="API Dashboard" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">API Dashboard</a></li>
<li>Documentation for <a title="content api documentation" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Content+by+CityGrid">Content</a> and <a title="advertising API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Ads+by+CityGrid">Advertising</a> APIs</li>

<p>I have a list of what I consider <a title="essential api building blocks" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">essential API area building blocks</a>, and most of them are represented here, but there were a couple missing.  So today I added 3 more areas:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Getting Started" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Getting+Started">Getting Started</a></li>
<li><a title="publisher overview" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Publisher+Overview">Publisher Overview</a></li>
<li><a title="FAQ" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/FAQ">FAQ</a></li>
</ul>
<p>An API has to have a getting started page as well as a place for frequently asked questions.  Developers have to find the information they need to go from evaluation to integration without asking for help.</p>
<p>The publisher overview page is unique.  It covers the different business tiers of developers, or as we call them at CityGrid, publishers.  Even though these tiers are unique to how we approach things at CityGrid, they are <a title="four potential levels of an api ecosystem" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">four potential levels of an API ecosystem</a>, that other API owners can employ.</p>
<p>The CityGrid API area is not up to par 100% by the standards I preach here on API Evangelist.  I&rsquo;m working on a new code samples page which has PHP, Python, Ruby code samples and starter kits--which I will publish this week at some point.  But overall the <a title="CityGrid API community" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com">CityGrid API community</a> contains the essential building blocks I feel are necessary to build an ecosystem, and I&rsquo;m working on finding out what else my developers will need to be successful and put them in my roadmap.</p>

<p>I am an eternal optimist, especially when it comes to APIs.  I really feel that <a title="APIs can decouple business assets and resources" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/12/25/apis-can-decouple-business-information-and-resources/">APIs can decouple businesses assets and resources</a>, making these companies much more efficient.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen the power of the API when it comes to companies like Twitter, Twilio, Facebook and many others.  But to build something on top of an API, you have to be a do-er.</p>
<p>A do-er is a term invented by Jeff Lawson (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jeffiel">@jeffiel</a>) of Twilio:</p>
<blockquote><em><a title="Do-er" href="http://www.twilio.com/doers">Do-er </a>(n): A particularly driven individual, esp. a developer, who picks up their tools and builds something special.</em></blockquote>
<p>Do-ers are a fundamental ingredient in API ecosystems, and when I go to many conferences and walk by booths I see a fundamentally different process of holding peoples hands and showing them what they need to know.  I also see many companies relying on this process to even make money.</p>
<p>So I have to ask--are we creating enough do-ers? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am very optimistic about the future of API growth, but I do worry sometimes about there being enough doers to make APIs continue to grow.  Many individuals are so used to the regular sales cycle and corporate training, they don&rsquo;t seem equipped to find solutions to their problems on their own.</p>
<p>Are you a do-er? &nbsp;Do you think there are enough do-ers out there?</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/02/07/lets-remake-libraries-as-hacker-spaces-and-community-innovation-centers/">Let's Remake Libraries as Hacker Spaces and Community Innovation Centers</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Feb 2012</span>
        <p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Library-NYC.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     I was reading several stories yesterday about the <a href="http://kalw.drupal.publicbroadcasting.net/post/goodbye-state-funding-california-libraries">State of California cutting funding for libraries across the state</a>. These kind of budget cuts really make me worry for the future of our children and our communities.
</p>
<p>
     I say it is time that we all come together and figure out a way to re-invent our libraries, and one possible way forward is to remake our local libraries as hacker space.
</p>
<p>
     Here are a few ideas I had today about this:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Dedicated Hacker Spaces</strong> - Each community could have a space to have hackathons that could be used for locally driven events as well as a place for out of town organizers to throw events.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Hackathon Model</strong> - Libraries could adopt a hackathon model for throwing small or large events in any area, allowing kids and adults to organize and participate in hackathons in any topic area.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Sponsorship</strong> - Bring in sponsors much like we do for hackathons, allowing tech and other companies to invest in single or ongoing hackathon efforts at libraries in the markets and subject areas that matter to them most.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Revenue Opportunities</strong> - These sponsorship opportunities would allow libraries to create new ways to fund their operations based upon the corporate sponsors that reflect the type of space libraries want to create.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Mentorship</strong> - Allow anyone to become a hacker mentor in any subject, allowing them to share expertise and knowledge with others in their community.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Resources</strong> - Libraries could provide access to computers, Internet connectivity, data repositories, code repositories, APIs, software and other resources that are essential to hackers.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Community Innovation</strong> - These new library hacker spaces could be centers for community innovation to occur, bringing in outside ideas, and circulating new ideas within existing community leaders.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Incubation</strong> - Library hacker spaces could be centers of business incubation, providing a rich and fertile environment for ideas to take root and find the resources and talent they need to actually become businesses, creating desperately needed jobs in communities.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I’m not sure entirely of the reasons why libraries are not a funding priority in this country, at a time when we are more than happy to fund wars, prisons and other areas that do not enrich our communities.  The whole thing just boggles my mind, and leaves me very concerned.
</p>
<p>
     Times are changing, and I’m sure this has something to do with it--regardless ibraries need to find new ways to stay relevant in this digitial age within their communities, and the tech community needs to step in and help.
</p>
<p>
     I think the hackathon model could provide a very positive way to remake our libraries into innovation centers within our communities, turning anyone into a potential hacker and mentor in the subject area they are most skilled and passionate about.
</p>
<p>
     I’d love to hear other ideas, about how we can do this, and I’ll work them into my future stories as well as my hackathon schedule as I travel around the country.

        <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/kaia-at-trojan-hack-2.JPG" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I brought my 11 year old daughter Kaia, to the <a title="Trojan Hack" href="http://trojanhack.co/">Trojan Hack</a> at USC Friday night and Saturday, which was a new experience for her. I wouldn&rsquo;t say she is on a track to be a hacker like her dad, but she does have a Chromebook, iPhone and is pretty technologically literate.</p>
<p>She has asked me a couple times about teaching her how to build a game, or some sort of fashion web site.  She has her own Wordpress blog and even went and setup her own Wordpress.com account to blog about Harry Potter without my help.</p>
<p>I asked her if she found any of the projects that were being built at the hackathon interesting--she said no, except the Wolves with Friends video game.  Then she said, &ldquo;maybe if there were more girl hackers, the projects would be more interesting&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Kaia is at a very important age, where I think she can be influenced or turned off in many different ways, and within a variety of subjects.  I don&rsquo;t want to push my hacker ways on her, but I want to influence her as much as I possibly can--and leave the decisions up to her.</p>
<p>When I go to hackathons with Audrey (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>) and my daughter I can&rsquo;t help but see it through their eyes--where not only the programming challenges are intimidating, but a room full of boys are a big turn off.  Something that isn&rsquo;t apparent to me, when I go by myself as hacker white guy.</p>
<p>One of things I&rsquo;ve noticed at various places I&rsquo;ve worked is that the tone of the workplace, the focus of projects, and the overall energy is different when there are more girls on teams.  This is something that is very apparent working at <a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygrid.com">CityGrid</a>, not just the diversity of the workplace, but that there are many female managers and team leads, which sets a very positive tone for the company.</p>
<p>We <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HAVE</strong></span> to begin to have more discussion about how do we evolve the face of hackathons to include a more diverse range of problem owners, including making sure women and girls feel much more comfortable, and are a much larger presence at hackathons.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2012</span>

     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/federal-government/nationl-park-ranger.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     I've been having a lot of discussions with folks around the country about how to make money from data. There is a lot of data being pushed out there from federal, state and city governments, as well as from private companies and individuals--without much evidence of revenue.
</p>
<p>
     At this point there seems to be money in acquiring, processing, storing an deriving meaning out of the data, but not much money in actually selling access directly to the data. Through portals like <a href="http://opendata.socrata.com/">opendata.socrata.com</a> we are seeing more government agencies and cities publish their data, and after talking with the guys from Socrata last week, their focus is on helping more agencies get their data up, not metering or building business models around the data. 
</p>
<p>
     Socrata has some great tools, that let developers customize how they want to access the data, and use in their applications, but there really are no mechanisms that allow data owners to make money from their data. Granted this is public data, so it should be publicly available for anyone to access and use. However there are costs associated with acquiring, processing and making this data available for download and via APIs.
</p>
<p>
     I've had discussions with several data evangelist about how government could maximize their efforts around data in the virtual space and even charge for it under certain circumstances, allowing them to generate revenue to cover operational costs as well as fund more data projects.
</p>
<p>
     If you think about it the government does this with public domain in the physical space. Cities and National Parks are free and open spaces for anyone to use, but once you begin looking to use these spaces for commercial use, you are required to apply for permits, and often pay fees and revenue share for access to these spaces and facilities. Why shouldn't this same thinking be applied to the virtual public domain?
</p>
<p>
     Don't get me wrong. I'm not a huge fan of having to pay for accessing public data at first thought, but if the data is still open for me to access, play with and use in a non-commercial setting, and I only start paying once I use for commercial purposes, it starts to make sense. It seems like the government could come up with a data licensing model that allows this type of free, limited usage, then paid commercial usage with some sort of attribution and contribute back when data is cleaned and enhanced.
</p>
<p>
     Obviously this model would require a lot more discussion, but if we could not just fund the operations of government data marketplaces, but also finance the acquisition and generation of new, high quality data--not only would our government be in a better position, I think businesses and the public would reap the benefits as well.

        <span class="post-date">31 Jan 2012</span>

     <a title="Developer Connect" href="http://developer.mashery.com/devconnect"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashery/Mashery-Developer-Connect.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     One of the biggest areas around APIs I think needs attention in 2012 is more tools that focus on developers. There are plenty API services and tools focusing on API owners, but we need to start making sure developers are taken care of.
</p>
<p>
     So its nice to see the Mashery’s new <a title="Developer Connect" href="http://developer.mashery.com/devconnect">Developer Connect</a>, which matches developers with companies looking for specific API development skills. Mashery partnered with <a title="Elance" href="https://www.elance.com/php/landing/main/login.php?crypted=cGVyc2lzaWQ9Mzg5ODQ5OTMx">Elance</a> to develop the API skill matchmaking service, powered by Elance’s huge network of professional technical talent.
</p>
<p>
     There are plenty of developers out there who have polished their skills working with specific APIs, either on production, or hobby development projects, and would love to find freelance work, and make some money of their talent.
</p>
<p>
     On the flip-side, there are plenty of companies looking to build web and mobile applications that use one or many APIs, and would prefer to contract with developers who already have experience with those APIs.
</p>
<p>
     Its a win-win situation for developers, API owners and companies looking to build on top of APIs. I think it is also a sign that the API space is really maturing. With platforms like Mashery’s Developer Connect, powered by Elance, developers may now be able to make a good living specializing in API development.
</p>
<p>
     Its a great idea, I wish I had come up with it! Oh wait. I did!! In fall of 2010, and pitched it to Elance, after pitching the idea, I even built a <a title="Elance Developer Area Prootype" href="http://elance.apievangelist.com/index.php">Elance Developer Area prototype</a>, and did a <a title="four part series on the potential" href="/2011/02/28/plug-and-play-api-developer-area-with-elance/">four part series on the potential</a>.
</p>
<p>
     I actually don’t have a problem with this, I thoroughly enjoy my ideas getting used, rather than sitting on the back burner. What did piss me off, is when I was offered the exclusive by Elance after they actually built their version...they sent me a <a title="TechCrunch Post" href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/09/mobile-component-marketplace-verious-exits-beta-partners-with-elance/">Techcrunch post</a>, saying here is your exclusive.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">Four Potential Levels of an API Business Ecosystem</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">31 Jan 2012</span>
        <p>
     <a title="CityGrid API" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/citygrid/CityGrid.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I'm working on a framework for the <a title="CityGrid API" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com">City Grid API</a> that helps define the different types of developers that are using our APIs, helping me understand how to better support them, and ensure their success.
</p>
<p>
     This particular approach is different than segmenting my developers by type of development, like web and mobile or by industry like real estate or medical. I'm focusing on the business side of the API, and identifying what developers need to be successful in the business of the applications they are building on the CityGrid API, and where I should focus CityGrid resources.
</p>
<p>
     I'm breaking down our API developers into four distinct levels:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Open</strong> - Publicly available, self-service use of the API, with general forum and email support via developer area.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Associate</strong> - Motivated app developers who demonstrate their understanding of an API, submit their app for internal approval and take advantage of revenue sharing opportunities around the API.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Partner</strong> - Developers who already have successful businesses or have built businesses around the CityGrid APIs, and may have higher usage needs, and usually contribute some value back to the CityGrid business model and API ecosystem.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Incubation</strong> - Developers who have grown their businesses in significant ways, but need mentoring and investment of additional resources to take their business to the next level.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Anyone can register to use the API and become an open developer, integrating businesses, <a title="places" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API">places</a> and other related content like <a title="reviews" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Reviews+API">reviews</a>, <a title="offers" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Offers+API">offers</a>, images and videos in their web or mobile apps. The API is self-service, allowing anyone to participate.  I can speculate what these developers need, but its up to them to let me know how they are building on the API and what they need to go to the next level.
</p>
<p>
     <a title="Photo Credit - Sustainable Labs" href="http://sustainablelab.co.za/idea-incubation"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/incubation.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     To rise up to the next level of associate, you need to demonstrate you've integrated CityGrid APis into your app, using best practices, while adhering to the CityGrid <a title="Terms and Conditions" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Terms+and+Conditions">Terms and Conditions</a> and <a title="Usage Requirements" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Usage+Requirements">Usage Requirements</a>. Once approved as an associate you can start making money with your application or site using <a title="web advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Web+Ads+API">web</a>, <a title="local mobile advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Mobile+Ads+API">mobile</a> or <a title="custom advertising" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Custom+Ads+API">custom advertising</a>, as well as taking advantage of <a title="places that pay" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+that+Pay">Place that Pay</a>.
</p>
<p>
     To become a partner your business usually provides some sort of value to CityGrid, and have potentially higher usage needs when it comes to CityGrid APIs. Not every developer has the opportunity to become a partner, but with the right business model, its an option that can be negotiated.
</p>
<p>
     We are all watching as technology incubators like <a title="Y Combinator" href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> and <a title="TechStars" href="http://www.techstars.com/">TechStars</a> mentor and invest in tech startups from Silicon Valley to New York City. CityGrid is integrating this model into its API ecosystem. Companies like <a title="UrbanSpoon" href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/">UrbanSpoon</a> and <a title="BuzzLabs" href="http://buzzlabs.com/">BuzzLabs</a> have started out as open developers, rising up the ladder, with hard work and incremental success, until they are in need of a higher level of attention from CityGrid, as well as providing a lot of value to the CitiyGrid network.
</p>
<p>
     Not all companies have the capacity to approach their APIs in the way I'm laying out, but for those looking to build a vibrant ecosystem around their API, where developers can not just play with your API, but truly build businesses and the next generation of startups, you may want to consider how you can define a similar set of levels, that help you identify and meet the business needs of your developers.

        <span class="post-date">30 Jan 2012</span>
        <p>
     <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021223.do"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/books/apis-a-strategy-guide.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I had the pleasure of getting an early copy of the <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021223.do">APIs: A Strategy Guide</a>, Creating Channels with Application Programming Interfaces, by Daniel Jacobson(<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>), Greg Brail(<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/gbrail">@gbrail</a>), Dan Woods(<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/danwoodscito">@danwoodscito</a>), published by O’Reilly Books.
</p>
<p>
     <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021223.do">APIs: A Strategy Guide</a>, provides the essential knowledge needed for planning, implementing and managing an API in this emerging API driven world. Written by Daniel Jacobsen who has managed two of the fastest growing and progressive APIs I know of--Netflix and NPR, and Greg Brail who is probably the one individual who has deployed the most number of APIs in the industry, and not leaving out Dan Woods who's is responsible for bringing this book together.
</p>
<p>
     The APIs: A Strategy Guide is sound advice for any executive, business, marketing or engineering person looking to deploy an API. But it doesn't stop there, as an experienced API product manager and evangelist it provides a framework to better look at much of what I already do, while also introducing some new concepts I hadn't considered.
</p>
<p>
     From a business perspective the book describes the API opportunity perfectly while providing the necessary business, product and value chain understanding to take on an API initiative within any company. As an author who's written a book on the <a title="Business of APIs" href="/business_of_apis.php">Business of APis</a>, Jacobsen, Brail and Woods take it even deeper and perfectly describe the business imperative for using APIs in your company.
</p>
<p>
     From a technical guide, you can't ask for a better approach than Jacobsen and Brail provide. API design is more art than science and they describe a balanced, but deeply technical approach for designing your API, wearing a very pragmatic hat, which is crucial in deploying a successful API.
</p>
<p>
     Beyond technical, the book provides the necessary legal considerations that come up when deploying an API, that could make or break your efforts. There is also concrete operational advice regarding how to approach the day to day operations of your API and ensure that you are able to measure and define the success of your API.
</p>
<p>
     The authors didn't neglect the most important aspect of any API, its developers. The book provides a key overview of what it will take to attract, engage and build a community of developers around your API. Without developers, your API will go nowhere.
</p>
<p>
     I've personally been working with RESTful APIs since their early days and have been studying the business of APis full time for the last year and half exclusively. Reading the APIs: A Strategy Guide, I added two extremely important concepts to my API model:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>APIs Expose Business Assets</strong> - APis are channels for exposing your most important business assets--products, services and information.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>API is a Contrac</strong>t - Developers are enticed to use the API because they know they can rely on it. The contract increases confidence, which increases use. The contract also makes the connection between pro-vider and consumer much more efficient since the interfaces are documented, consistent, and predictable.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     The authors leave us with the knowledge you will need build a case for an API within your company, plan, implement and manage internal, partner and public APIs. The book ends right where you will be once you successfully launch your API; the beginning. The beginning of a whole new world of innovation, R&amp;D, equipped with a biz dev 2.0 platform that will enable your company to stay competitive in the emerging API economy.

        <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2012</span>
        <p><a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://sdkbridge.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/sdk-bridge/SDKBridge-logo.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><em>This post comes from the&nbsp;<a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://sdkbridge.com/">SDK Bridge</a>&nbsp;newsletter. &nbsp;I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you.</em></p>
<p>I recently received an email with the subject "FW: boring job". It was a long email chain that started with someone casting about for someone to write API documentation. It got me thinking about how most developers must wonder&nbsp;<em>why on earth</em>&nbsp;someone with the skills to program would choose to write API documentation instead.</p>
<p>"Why" is a good question to ask yourself when starting up a new year. In fact, I recently saw a&nbsp;<a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/ikbtkt/hdhyyhjli/r/" target="_blank">TED talk video by Simon Sinek</a>&nbsp;on how the most effective people, companies, and organizations, start by thinking about&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;they do something instead of&nbsp;<em>what</em>. In the video, Sinek brings up examples like Apple, the Wright Brothers, and even Martin Luther King, whose most famous speech began with "I have a dream" (why) and not "I have a plan" (what).</p>
<p>In this newsletter, I'll talk about why we write API documentation, from how it impacts the world to how it challenges us personally. But first, here's what SDK Bridge been up to since our last newsletter:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Writing C++ documentation for software embedded into agricultural vehicles.</li>
<li>Writing REST documentation for a company that creates software for governments.</li>
<li>Writing REST documentation based on&nbsp;<a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/ikbtkt/hdhyyhjli/y/" target="_blank">OpenSocial</a>&nbsp;to be able to create and manage online meetings.</li>
<li>Writing IT documentation for&nbsp;<a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/ikbtkt/hdhyyhjli/j/" target="_blank">Microsoft HealthVault</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>- Peter Gruenbaum, President, SDK Bridge</p>
<h2>Why We Write API Documentation</h2>
<p>To most developers, writing <a title="API Documentation" href="http://sdkbridge.com/index.php">API documentation</a> is nothing short of torture. But to a few of us, it's a fascinating area. What gets us so excited?</p>
<h3>Enormous Impact</h3>
<p>In case you haven't heard, the biggest technology revolution is happening since the invention of HTML. We've all heard about the explosion of smart phone, tablet, and software-as-a-service technology, but not everyone knows that APIs are what's driving all of these technologies, providing people with instant access to data. It used to be that only the people who had the data could write the software that granted access, but with APIs, the number of software developers who can create applications with that data is vastly increased. Companies are discovering that developers are doing things with their data that they had never dreamed of. It's an exciting time to be working in software.</p>
<p>Ask anyone in the API industry what the biggest obstacles are to creating apps, and I guarantee that they will bring up API documentation. Good documentation results in application innovation; bad documentation stifles it. API writers have the power to get an API adopted and used.</p>
<h3>An Interesting Human-Computer Interaction Challenge</h3>
<p><a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/ikbtkt/hdhyyhjli/t/" target="_blank">Donald Norman</a>, the Human-Computer Interaction guru, once wrote an&nbsp;<a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r/l/ikbtkt/hdhyyhjli/i/" target="_blank">interesting essay</a>&nbsp;of how the qualities of human beings are different than the qualities of computers. The way that we think is different than the way that machines "think", and a good user interface bridges the gap, making the computer intuitive to the person.</p>
<p>When your product is a software platform, then your API and its accompanying documentation is its user interface. If you want the API to be usable, then you have to figure how to bridge that difficult gap between the linear, inflexible world of computer programming and the non-linear, flexible way that people think and learn. It's a fascinating challenge.</p>
<h3>Extreme Variety</h3>
<p>Writing documentation for an API is a much faster process than writing the API itself. This means that an API writer often gets to learn about something, explain it, and then move on to the next thing. In just the last two years, I've gotten to learn about eCommerce, health care, traffic prediction, agricultural vehicles, online meetings, call centers, mobile phone applications, electric utilities, and noSQL databases. I even once wrote documentation to help the search for extraterrestial intelligence.</p>
<p>In the near future, everyone who has data will have an API to access that data, and all of those APIs need documentation. Writing that documentation is a way to get a taste of all of the different worlds that software is touching.</p>
<h3>On the Cutting Edge</h3>
<p>One of the big challenges of being a developer is staying on top of the latest technologies while there is so much legacy code to maintain that's built on old technology. Often developers get stuck working in old technology, wistfully wishing they could be on the cutting-edge.</p>
<p>Companies like to promote their platforms that use the hottest languages and protocols. That means that they will prioritize documentation for those platforms. Not only that, but I find that writers are given even more permission than developers when it comes to learning technology on the job. Between these two, API writers often get to work with the latest and greatest technologies</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Enormous impact, thinking about how people learn, extreme variety, and getting to work with cutting edge technology - it's pretty cool being an <a title="API Writer" href="http://sdkbridge.com/index.php">API writer</a> these days. Of course, you have to love to write and you have to love to program. But if you are good at those two things, there's never been a better time to be an API writer.</p>

     <a title="Rapportive" href="http://rapportive.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/rapportive/rapportive-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     When new developers register for the <a title="CityGrid APIs" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid API</a>, I get an email with their name and email address. I want to make sure each developer knows I’m here, and available to help them get up and running as quick as possible.
</p>
<p>
     Emailing them as soon as they register seems a little too pushy, but following them on Twitter, with <a title="my personal Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/kinlane">my personal Twitter</a> and the <a title="CityGrid API Twitter Account" href="https://twitter.com/#!/CityGridAPITeam">CityGrid API Twitter account</a> makes sense. So how do I get their Twitter handle, without spending too much time and derailing whatever I’m working on?
</p>
<p>
     In comes <a title="Rapportive" href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a>. For those of you who don’t know what Rapportive is, it is an browser add-on that runs in my Gmail and shows me everything about a contact I’m emailing with. On the right hand side it lists as much information associated with the email as the service can find, such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.
</p>
<p>
     So when I get a new registration email from CityGrid APIs, I highlight the email address and it shows me information about the user. Many users don’t maintain active online profiles, so it returns nothing. However a handful, have Twitter accounts associated, which I immediately follow with my personal and CityGrid API Twitter accounts.
</p>
<p>
     Both of my Twitter profiles clearly reflect <a title="CityGrid APIs" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid APIs</a>, so when I follow them on Twitter, my developers know who I am, and they should now be aware that I am here to help. If they have any questions, they know they know how to find me.
