{% include JB/setup %}<p>Factual just launched a new API that will centralize how physical places are represented within Factual data-sets, and across 3rd party APIs, dubbed the Factual Crosswalk API.Data about physical places is notoriously messy, and with number of providers, and the growing value of location based data, its only going to get messier.Factual is aiming to normalize places data across the web by providing a central ID to link individual entries across multiple data providers.Using the Factual Crosswalk API you can retrieve a place by providing its Factual ID or any associated URL, either way you get a complete record from the Factual database, and URLs to its associated IDs and locations.The Factual Crosswalk API can be used to link to data across the Internet, as well as cleaning and standardizing local data sets.</p>
