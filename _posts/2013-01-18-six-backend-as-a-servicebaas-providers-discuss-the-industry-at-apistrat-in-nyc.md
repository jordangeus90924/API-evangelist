{% include JB/setup %}<p>Backend as a Service (BaaS), sometimes called Mobile Backend is a Service (MBaaS) is a growing trend I’m monitoring at API Evangelist.I’m tracking on 20 providers in the space, with two newly added open-source BaaS platforms.Beyond the research, stories and analysis on BaaS, I just added a BaaS panel at the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference in New York City, February 21st and 22nd.The panel will include six of the leading BaaS platforms: Marc Weil (@marcweil) of Cloudmine James Tamplin (@jamestamplin) of Firebase Miko Matasumura (@mikojava) of Kii Morgan Bickle (@morganbickle) of Kinvey Ilya Sukhar (@ilyasu) of Parse Ty Amell (@tyamell) of StackMob  API play a critical role in BaaS platforms by providing interfaces for the common services emerging in the BaaS space, like object storage, user management and location, to name a few, but also bring in other 3rd party services like Twitter and Facebook.I will be moderating this new BaaS panel at APIStrat.</p>
