<p>Jerome Louvel <a href="http://apis.how/5ytnitnakm">from Restlet</a> introduced me to <a href="https://openservicebrokerapi.org/">the Open Service Broker API</a> the other day, a “project allows developers, ISVs, and SaaS vendors a single, simple, and elegant way to deliver services to applications running within cloud-native platforms such as Cloud Foundry, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. The project includes individuals from Fujitsu, Google, IBM, Pivotal, RedHat and SAP.”

<p>Honestly, I only have so much cognitive capacity to understand everything I come across, so I pasted the link into my super secret Slack group for API super heroes to get additional opinions. My friend James Higginbotham (<a href="https://twitter.com/launchany">@launchany</a>) quickly responded with, “if I understand correctly, this is a standard that would be equiv to Heroku’s Add-On API? Or am I misunderstanding? The Open Service Broker API is a clean abstraction that allows ‘services’ to expose a catalog of capabilities, as well as the ability to create, use and delete those services. Sounds like add-on support to me, but I could be wrong[…]But seems very much like vendor-to-vendor. Will be interesting to track.”

<p>At first glance, I thought it was more of an aggregation and/or discovery solution, but I think James is right. It is an API scaffolding that SaaS platforms can plug into their platforms to broker other 3rd party API services. It allows any platform to offer <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/extending-heroku">an environment for extending your platform like Heroku does</a>, as James points out. It is something that adds an API discovery dimension to the concept of offering up plugins, or I guess what could be an embedded API marketplace within your platform. Opening up <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">wholesale</a> and private label opportunities for API providers to sell their warez directly on other people’s platforms.

<p>The concept really isn’t anything new. I remember developing document print plugins for Box back when I worked with the Mimeo print API in 2011. <a href="https://openservicebrokerapi.org/">The Open Service Broker API</a> is just looking to standardize this approach so hat  API provider could bake in a set of 3rd party partner APIs directly into their platform. <a href="http://plugin.apievangelist.com/">I’ve recently added a plugin area to my API research</a>. I will add the Open Service Broker API as an organization within this research. I’m probably also going to add it to my <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery research</a>, and I’m even considering expanding it into an API marketplace section of my research.  I can see add-on, plugin, marketplace, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">API brokering like this grow into its own discipline</a>, with a growing number of definitions, services, and tools to support.
