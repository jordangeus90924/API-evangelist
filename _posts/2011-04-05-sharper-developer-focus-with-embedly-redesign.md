[<img src="http://api.embed.ly/media/images/api/logo.png" alt="" align="right" />][1][Embed.ly launched a new, improved API area][1] with a focus on helping first time users to understand what the API is, and how to use it quicker.

If your not familiar with Embed.ly, the API allows developers to embed videos, images and rich media from 212 services through a single API.

The web site redesign brings [API documentation][2] and overview of their [oEmbed][3] technology front and center on dashboard.

Also providng direct links to client-side libraries:[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/embedly-api-area.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />][1]

  * [jQuery][4]
  * [Closure][5]
As well as server-side libraries:
  * [Python][6]
  * [Ruby][7]
  * [Node][8]
  * [PHP][9]
  * [Java][10]
There is also quick access to common CMS and blogging platforms tools they've developed for:
  * [Wordpress Plugin][11]
  * [Embedly Script Tag][12]
  * [RegEx Generator][13]
Also providing important spotlight for community-developed tools:
  * [Drupal Module][14]
  * [Joomla Plugin][15]
[Embed.ly][16] goes even further and provides prominent placement of their Try it Out tool, letting users quickly test drive services from supported platforms.

The web site redesign demonstrates many important characteristics of an [API dashboard][17] with single click access to documentation, libraries, plugins, and other resources that quickly get developers up and running.
