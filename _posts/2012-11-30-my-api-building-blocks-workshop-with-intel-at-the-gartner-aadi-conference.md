I conducted two workshops this week in partnership with Intel at the Gartner AADI Conference in Las Vegas. Working from my [Building Blocks of a Successful API][1] material, I put together a 30 minute workshop that I conducted at 12 and 6PM on Tuesday.

My workshop started with the [history of APIs][2], then walked through [API building blocks][3] in 3 areas:

  * API Design 
  * API Development 
  * API Evangelist

Then I stepped back and emphasized that APIs are all about research
