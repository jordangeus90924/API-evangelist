<p>I gave a talk early in in June at POST/CON 2018 in San Francisco. The conference was a great mix of discussions reflecting the Postman community. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM-7VG-sgbtCv6yx5Af3pGikTYIE3CAdu">You can find all the talks on Google</a>, including mine about moving towards a modern AP lifecycle.

<p>You can find <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">all the stop along what I consider to be a modern API lifecycle on the home page of API Evangelist</a>, with links to any of my research, services, tooling, and other storytelling Iâ€™ve done in each area.

<p>Thanks again to Postman for having me out!
