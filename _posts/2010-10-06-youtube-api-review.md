One of the keys to YouTube's success as a video sharing platform is its successful API that allows developers and site owners to embed, share and distribute YouTube content across the Intertubes. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Youtube-Google-Code-Screenshot.PNG" alt="" width="375" align="right" /> As with many of its other products, Google starts with the essential API ecosystem building blocks:

  * Dashboard
  * Quickstart
  * Docs
  * Sample Code
  * Forum
  * Articles
  * Blog
In addition, YouTube really support its partner and developers with:
  * Partners Showcase
  * App Gallery
  * Widgets
  * White Label Player
Google also enforces brand integrity with a few tools:
  * Branding Guidelines
  * Compatibility
  * Terms
Google definitely has a solid formula for replicating its API ecosystems in its different products, and the [YouTube developer area][1] is an excellent example of this formula being applied to a media API.

Like Google's other projects, YouTube utilizes [Google Code][2] as the repository for its API community and code.
