{% include JB/setup %}<p>Ive been tracking on what I call API aggregation for some time now.I started seeing the API aggregation trends in 2010, then I saw this pick up in 2011 with the emergence of providers like Singly and Adigami.While many new companies provide you with interoperability and automation between multiple APIs, I consider aggregators to be about bringing together multiple APIs into a single aggregated end-point for developers to use, then also providing potentially new APIs that are only possible, because of the aggregation.Last year, after I started spending more time in Washington DC, I met a talented group of folks who were playing around with the idea of an aggregate API for federal government.In the last couple weeks it looks like they were serious about it, and launched the debut version of Fed{API}.</p>
