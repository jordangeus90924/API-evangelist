I’m a big supporter of [API providers having a healthy embed strategy][1]. I bundle any widgets, buttons and any API driven tool that allows enables users to take advantage of APIs, under the label, "API embed strategy".

I noticed that Twitter gave it’s embeddable tools feature status in the [Twitter developer area][2]:

Embeddable tools like Twitter’s [Embedded Timelines][3], [Twitter Cards][4], [Embedded Tweets][5], [Tweet Button][6] and [Follow Button][7] are all great for empowering all your users to take advantage of an API.

Twitter’s move is similar to that of [LinkedIn, who also de-emphasized their API interfaces and offered various embeddable tools, badge and widget builder tools][8] that help extend the API across the interwebz.
