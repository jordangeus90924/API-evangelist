Here is a video of one of my talks fromÂ [API Days in Paris][1], France where I walked the internal side of APIs. This talk is derived from my post, [the secret to amazons success is internal][2] and stories I've written on [Netflix's success with internal APIs][3].

The presentation for this talk is available in my talks section at [The Secret to a Successful ApI is Internal][4].

You can find another video from API Days by me called [Business Models For Your API as Startup from API Days][5], in a nearlier post.
