{% include JB/setup %}<p>Intel is reportedly buying API service provider Mashery for “a range of $120 million to $180 million”, according to ReadWrite(Web).As I reflect on this, two main questions come to mind: Was it a smart acquisition for Intel, and worth their money?Is this a logical move for Intel since they are a chip maker?Was Intel’s acquisition smart for Intel?If they are serious about playing in the API game, which all signals I’ve seen say yes, I think it was smart.</p>
