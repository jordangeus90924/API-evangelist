{% include JB/setup %}<p>Over the holidays I added a new section to API Evangelist called trends.One of the areas I’m tracking on is what I’m calling “scripting platforms”.While you can program against any API using the language of your choice, these platforms are aggregating APIs and make available through a custom language stack.This approach is different than what I’m seeing from aggregate APIs like Singly.Scripting platforms may offer aggregate APIs, but are also providing a way to easily script against them, in new and abstracted ways.</p>
