{% include JB/setup %}<p>The FCC Open Commission recently proposed to require that television stations make their “public inspection file” available online.The public inspection file is a traditional hallmark of broadcast regulation--a collection of documents that all radio and television stations must maintain and make publicly accessible.But as the Technology Liberation Front points out, “availability is not accessibility”, stating: If the FCC follows its usual practice of having filers submit PDFs (many of which are often scanned from printed documents), this data may be nearly useless to the small number of researchers who would really benefit from having a large set of public inspection files available online.This is a common misconception among government agencies, that just publishing a PDF to a web is making the information “accessible”.Sure anyone can download this information, but it makes extracting meaning and value across many television stations so much work, pretty much nobody will do it.</p>
