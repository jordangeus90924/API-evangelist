	<p>This blog is dedicated to understanding the world of APIs, exploring a wide range of topics from design to deprecation, and spanning the technology, business, and politics of APIs. <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-evangelist" target="_blank">All of this runs on Github, so if you see a mistake, you can either fix by submitting a pull request, or let us know by submitting a Github issue for the repository</a>.</p>

<p>Right before the Thanksgiving holiday, in an effort to make the Facebook platform more responsive and dependable for developers, <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2012/11/15/delivering-important-alerts-about-your-app/">Facebook announced Developer Alerts</a>.  Developer alerts are a way for Facebook platform developers to receive critical information about their apps via email or Facebook notification.</p>
<p>Facebook Developer Alerts provide the following for Facebook app administrators:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Breaking Changes </strong>- If your app is using functionality that FB is changing or removing, you will be sent an alert at least 90 days before the change goes into effect</li>
<li><strong>App Status Changes</strong> - If you have submitted Open Graph actions or created an app detail page for App Center, FB will use Developer Alerts to notify you when the status of your submission changes</li>
<li><strong>Policy Violations and Enforcement -</strong> If your app doesn&rsquo;t adhere to FB Platform Policies you will be notified through these alerts</li>
</ul>
<p>Facebook Developer Alerts are more than notifications, it is an issue management system which will allow multiple developers on a project to known when action is required or things have been resolved.</p>
<p>It seems like a great approach to improving communications between API platforms and its API application developers.  I think I will add platform alerts as an official API building block, and recommend it as something API should consider when developing their platform.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.twilio.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/twilio/Twilio-Logo.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Poster boy for how to properly run your API ecosystem properly, <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, recently updated their <a href="http://www.twilio.com/doers">DOer Gallery</a> to highlight developers in the Twilio ecosystem that build cool stuff on the popular voice and SMS API.</p>
<p>Twilio has the best record I&rsquo;ve seen of any API, when it comes to showcasing and being loved by their developer community, and I'm sure the DOer Gallery plays an important role in that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twilio.com/doers"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/twilio/twilio-doers-gallery.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The Twilio DOer Gallery has the following features:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Personal Details</li>
<li>Short Bio</li>
<li>Skills</li>
<li>Other Profiles</li>
<li>Projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Devloper Galleries like Twilios might not be for every API platform.  But if you have a passionate base of developers you might want to consider giving them their own profile and a gallery where they can not just discover and interact with each other, it can let other companies find potential developers to execute projects via your API.</p>
<p>A Developer Gallery can be a great way to give your API developers some love and attention.  Twilio even features developers from their DOer Gallery on their blog in a "DOer of the Month".</p>
<p>Would showcasing your &ldquo;API DOers&rdquo; benefit your API community?</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.adigami.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/adigami/adigami-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In 2012 the number of APIs has grown significantly.  We are transitioning from &ldquo;there aren&rsquo;t enough APIs&rdquo; to &ldquo;how do we more intelligently use many APIs&rdquo;.  As I track on this and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">future of web APIs</a>, I&rsquo;m noticing growth in the number of API aggregators like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I was introduced <a title="Adigami" href="http://www.adigami.com/">Adigami</a>, a "Singly for Analytics".  While Singly focuses on personal data API aggregation, Adigami is focused on <a title="aggregating the top analytic platforms used in business today" href="http://www.adigami.com/">aggregating the top analytic platforms used in business today</a>--covering seven key channels:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adigami.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/adigami/adigami-data-visual.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Web</strong> - Google Analytics</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - Google AdWords, Microsoft Bing</li>
<li><strong>Display</strong> - DoubleClick, Yahoo! APT, Facebook Ads, MediaMind</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Facebook Insights, Twitter</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - Yahoo! Mobile, Verve Wireless</li>
<li><strong>Email</strong> - MailChimp, SendGrid, ConstantContact, ExactTarget</li>
<li><strong>Custom</strong> - Adigami can import proprietary data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Operating your business on the Internet or "in the cloud" is a reality, and as we operate more and more in this cloud, each platform will have its own set of analytics--making the need to centralize and standardize analytics across channels and platforms more and more critical.</p>
<p>Adigami is just the tip of the iceberg.  I predict we&rsquo;ll see API aggregators emerge from top industries like government, healthcare and education.  In 2013 we will learn to more fluently communicate with web APIs with the help of API aggregators like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and <a title="Adigami" href="http://www.adigami.com/">Adigami</a>.</p>

<p>Swag can be a critical tool in any API evangelist toolbox.  And stickers are one piece of swag that if possessing the right design, can be something developers will take home and put to use.</p>
<p>Earlier today Ari Fuchs (<a href="https://twitter.com/arifuchs">@arifuchs</a>), developer evangelist for <a href="http://www.aviary.com/">Aviary</a> asked, &ldquo;<strong><em>who do you use to print your sticker swag?</em></strong>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The legal building blocks of an API can be just as critical as the technical and business building blocks.  It makes sense to version and communicate your API terms of use (TOS) , privacy policy and branding guidelines alongside your code.</p>
<p>Since Github will allow document types other than code, such as markdown and PDF, it can make sense to use Github for managing the legal side of your API.</p>
<p>Using Github for the legal aspects of API operation will provide a level of transparency developers will appreciate, allowing them to download and store for their own records while being able to see the difference between each version, in a format that makes sense to them.</p>
<p>Just as with all other areas of an API, Github will allow you to completely manage the evolution of your API terms, privacy and branding in a way that is in sync with all the other technical and business building blocks of your API.</p>
<p>Consider using Github for API legal building block management.</p>

<p>I am heading to Paris, France next week for <a href="http://apidays.io/" target="_blank">API Days</a>.  API Days is December 3rd and 4th in Paris and is dubbed as the <em>"First National Event on APIs in Europe"</em>.   The two day event is organized by <a title="FaberNovel" href="http://www.fabernovel.com/en/">faberNovel</a>, who helps large organizations think and act like startups, and by <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">WebShell</a>, who enables developers to easily make advanced web and mobile applications based on APIs.</p>
<p><a href="http://apidays.io/" target="_blank">API Days</a>&nbsp;sees the API economy the same way I do:</p>
<blockquote><em>The Web 1.0 was readable, the Web 2.0 was social, now the web is programmable through application programming interfaces, aka APIs. Web APIs are a unique opportunity for companies, governments and developers to either better organize the governance of their IT into a scalable and flexible model, either leverage a complete ecosystem around the organization, exchanging data through the web for trillion of applications on billion devices. Because each civilization has been described by the way it communicates and make exchanges, API are the beginning of a programmable civilization.</em></blockquote>

<p>The API event is hosting over 50 sessions from over 30 speakers--including two of my own talks:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>The Secret to a Successful API is Internal</li>
<li>Business models for your API as a start-up</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see APIs getting interest in Europe.  And after working with the Webshell team for several months and learning more about FaberNovel, I'm excited to be working with both of them to drive API adoption in Europe.</p>
<p>If you are planning on going to <a href="http://apidays.io/" target="_blank">API Days</a>, let me know and I&rsquo;ll make time to talk.  If you aren&rsquo;t, I will publish more info about the event and my talks here on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, when it is all wrapped up.</p>

<p>The team over at <a href="http://chartboost.com" target="_blank">Chartboost</a> have a pretty forward thinking <a href="http://blog.chartboost.com/post/36221629171/web-3-0-help-site?hn">blog post about what they see as the next generation of web application development</a>.</p>
<p>They feel that the future is about creating web applications, not sites.  The server side should be an API and the client should be a self-contained app which uses the API as its back-end.  With mobile applications following the same pattern.</p>
<p>To practice what they preach, Charboost is overhauling their help site to be an API driven web app using the following approach:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Push State</strong> - Provide site navigation without page refreshes by faking navigation and inserting JavaScript callbacks</li>
<li><strong>JSON-API </strong>- A REST API providing JSON to drive the site</li>
<li><strong>Responsive Design </strong>- Providing an application design that responds to mobile as well as it does laptops or desktop computers</li>
<li><strong>Vector (Icon Fonts &amp; CSS)</strong> - Using a combination of icon fonts and CSS3 to deliver the UI. SCSS - A new technology that uses CSS-preprocessing to make the CSS code cleaner and res-usable</li>
<li><strong>Markdown</strong> - Using the simple markup language to allow anyone on their team to write and edit help articles</li>
<li><strong>GitHub</strong> - Using Github to manage the help center as an open project</li>
</ul>

<p>I agree that their metholody has the potential to be one possible future of web and mobile application development.  JavaScript and API development have both matured in the last 10 years, getting us to this point where you can build some damn sexy, but simple apps that run smoothly on the web or mobile devices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Or as Chartboost puts it:</p>
<blockquote><em>We believe that the web is finally reaching a tipping point. The culmination of a decade of incremental improvements to web technologies is upon us, and lets us do things in a way that is radically new and better.</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m also playing around with my own approach to delivering apps in this way using Github + Jeckyll + Mustache Templates with JSON data stores, all running as open repositories using Github Pages.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have more to publish on this in the near future.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/twitter-access.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>Social analytics provider&nbsp;<a title="PeopleBrowsr" href="http://www.peoplebrowsr.com/">PeopleBrowsr</a>&nbsp;has won a temporary injunction against Twitter today, with a complaint filed in San Francisco Superior Court. It reads:</p>
<p><em>PeopleBrowsr seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent Twitter from destroying its business, interfering with PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s contractual and prospective business relations, and restraining competition in markets using Twitter data.</em></p>
<p>The complaint was filed in response to a trheat from Twitter to cut off PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s access to its Firehose by November 30, 201 &nbsp;PeopleBrowsr has had access to the full Twitter full firehose for over four years. According to the complaint:</p>
<p><em>PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s products require the full Firehose feed. A mere sample of Twitter data is insufficient for PeopleBrowsr to provide the products its users expect. Though there are some data analytics companies that can provide certain limited types of Twitter data analysis based on sampling, PeopleBrowsr competes in a separate &ldquo;Twitter Big Data Analytics&rdquo; market, in which a few, highly sophisticated players analyze massive amounts of Twitter data to provide deeper insights.</em></p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s decision to terminate PeopleBrowsr&rsquo;s firehose follows a&nbsp;<a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">pattern of it consistently cutting off partner and developer access to the platforms and its data</a>. In doing so Twitter&nbsp;has sought more control in their effort to monetize the social networking platform and provide&nbsp;<a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/07/22/investment-in-twitter/">investors with a return on their investment of almost 1.4B dollars</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/peoplebrowsr/PeopleBrowsr-logo.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>PeopleBrowsr states that it has &ldquo;invested millions of dollars and years of work in building a business based on the Firehose&rdquo;. It says it did so in rlying on Twitter&rsquo;s representations that it would maintain an &ldquo;open ecosystem&rdquo; and allow other companies to use of its data. Through agreements with Twitter PeopleBrowsr felt it could compete without fear that Twitter would cut off access to its data in order to influence which businesses succeed or to usurp business opportunities for itself.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">Twitter has consistently described</a>&nbsp;the Firehose as a part of this open ecosystem that it would make available to &ldquo;everyone in the system&rdquo;, and this open approach was a key component of Twitter&rsquo;s business strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The injunction PeopleBrowsr received today will keep their firehose access open until January, when further hearings on the case will be held. Until now, all the outcy regarding Twitter&rsquo;s restriction of access to the platform have been vocal, but without any legal action. The filing by PeopleBrowsr shows the situation has truly become serious and will move discussion about Twitter access from the tech blogosphere and hacker news into the U.S legal system.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Those of you who follow my blog, know my favorite API management service provider is <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a>.  It&rsquo;s no secret I&rsquo;m a fan of what they are doing.  We share a vision of the API space and what a healthy API industry <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> look like.</p>
<p>In support of that vision, 3Scale just launched a new open source API proxy build on the <a title="NGINX" href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">NGNIX</a> web server technology--a move, I feel is important for 3Scale, as well as the entire API industry.</p>
<p>What makes 3Scale&rsquo;s approach signficant, is that by deploying the NGNIX proxy, API providers don't need to rely on proprietary API proxy solutions, while also gaining additional benefits, such as acess to a library of 3rd party <a title="addons" href="http://wiki.nginx.org/3rdPartyModules">addons</a> and <a title="modules" href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Modules">modules</a> available in the NGNIX ecosystem. All while employing an established technology that has been proven to deliver in highl volume production environments.</p>
<p>In addition to the benefits provided by NGNIX, the proxy provides seamless integration with 3Scale&rsquo;s API management platform that delivers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>API business modeling using service contracts, API rate limits and pricing rules</li>
<li>API access control &amp; security with API key generation with user id, app id, oAuth</li>
<li>API analytics &amp; reporting including alerts, statistics, business intelligence</li>
<li>API billing &amp; payments supporting pre-paid, post-paid, PCI compliant, six separate payment gateways</li>
<li>Developer portal for self-service registration and onboarding</li>
<li>Interactive API Documentation for better adoption using Swagger</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3Scale/3scale-API-Proxy-Admin-Panel.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>This list represents everything you will need to get your API up and running.  3Scale enables you to do this both on premise or in the cloud, using a proxy that you cotrol--then alllowing you to choose which 3Scale API management services you need to use.  But what is most important for me, is 3Scale allows you start off without spending any money.  3Scale has a free, entry level tier that will allow you to design, experiment and iterate until you find the meaningful API definition that works for your developers--at which time you can scale, paying for only what you need, as you grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach is critical to success of individual APIs as well as the overall health of the API industry.  We need to allow companies to innovate without spending a fortune, give up control of their data, and being locked into unnecessary commitments--allowing the industry to go from thousands of APIs to millions of APIs as quickly as possible.</p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;As of today this makes 3scale the API Management solution provider with the richest and most flexible set of technical options to manage API traffic,&rdquo; said Guillaume Balas, 3scale CMO. &ldquo;At 3scale we want companies with great and valuable APIs to be able to distribute them easily, rapidly, without hampering the economics of their API project and without disrupting their existing infrastructure: this what 3scale&rsquo;s API Management solution provides.&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>The 3Scale approach is in aligment with my industry philosophy, that we shouldn&rsquo;t stand in the way of API providers with costly, proprietary proxies.  We should leverage existing, proven, open technologies like NGINX to allow API providers to deploy wherever their infrastructure exists, either in the datacenter or the cloud--while enabling them to &ldquo;connect&rdquo; to the best of breed API management services, which allow them to scale, grow and evolve their API ecosystem in the healthiest way possible.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/State-Healthcare-Insurance-Exchanges.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was listening to a story about <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/11/13/165057222/nevada-quietly-starts-implementing-obamacare">Nevada quietly starting their implementation of health insurance exchanges</a>, as part of what everyone loves to call Obamacare.  I&rsquo;m not even going to get involved in the politics and merit of making sure everyone is insured--I want to focus on the execution of it.</p>
<p>Immediately I think:  <em><strong>Where is the state health insurance exchange platform API?</strong></em></p>
<p>According to healthcare.gov an exchange is:</p>
<blockquote><em> A mechanism for organizing the health insurance marketplace to help consumers and small businesses shop for coverage in a way that permits easy comparison of available plan options based on price, benefits and services, and quality.  By pooling people together, reducing transaction costs, and increasing transparency, Exchanges create more efficient and competitive markets for individuals and small employers.</em></blockquote>
<p>And the principles and priorities of state health insurance exchanges are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Establishing a State-based Exchange</strong> - Establishment of an Exchange is a critical step that States must take to be on track for achieving certification of an Exchange by January 1, 2013 under Section 1321. </li>
<li><strong>Promoting Efficiency </strong>- Exchanges must be mindful of costs for consumers, employers, and the federal government. </li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Adverse Selection</strong> - Successful Exchanges will avoid adverse selection by ensuring that those who buy through the Exchange are a broad mix of the healthy and the less healthy.</li>
<li>Streamlined Access and Continuity of Care.  Section 1311(d)(4)(F) requires Exchanges to evaluate and determine eligibility for applicants in Medicaid, the Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and other health programs - Exchanges must also comply with all applicable federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination.  The federal government will provide critical building blocks and financial support for achieving an efficient enrollment process including verification of&nbsp;eligibility for tax credits.</li>
<li>Public Outreach and Stakeholder Involvement - Section 1311(d)(6) requires Exchanges to consult with a broad range of stakeholders in carrying out their activities.</li>
<li>Public Accountability and Transparency - Accountability requires transparency.  Section 1311(d)(7) requires public reports on Exchange activities, and Section 1311(e)(3) requires additional reporting, which should include standardized data reporting on price, quality, benefits, consumer choice and other factors that will help measure and evaluate performance. </li>
<li>Financial Accountability - Section 1313 provides for the efficient and non-discriminatory administration of Exchanges, and seeks to prevent fraud and abuse.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are going to successfully implement 50 state health insurance exchanges that meet the definition, principles and priorities of the federal government objectives, you will need an open source platform, complete with a robust API strategy.  Maybe it exists, and I&rsquo;m unaware of it.</p>
<p>If you know more about current initiatives in this area, please let me know.</p>

<p>Hackathons are a fertile environment for generating code based upon the ideas of its attendees.  However, much of the innovative programming that occurs at these events is forgotten the day after the event ends.  This process tends to leave developers working on the same ideas over and over, without much continuity.</p>
<p>To help remedy this, hackathon organizers can use Github to store code that is generated by all attendees. Organizers can encourage all developers to commit their code through-out the hackathon, and wrap up the event with a README file of their project as part of the presentation process.</p>
<p>Github can be a great way to showcase what was built over the weekend, make the intellectual property open and accessible for other people to use, and make it easier for other hackathon participants to build off what has already been created in the past.</p>
<p>Using Github for a hackathon can generate extra marketing for the event as well as the hackathon organizers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always on the hunt for meaningful API analogies, to stock my evangelism toolbox.   Ways that I can relate the potential of APIs, in a way that anyone can understand, even non-developers.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the success of the web API movement lies in the ability to extend, potentially complex resources in a very simplistic and universal way.  So, as an evangelism I have to abstract away the complexities and make sure I connect with my audience.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m tracking on the API space and working to quantify the potential future of APIs, I&rsquo;m struggling to find meaningful analogies to articulate where API driven platforms like Singly are moving the industry.  But just as with the technology, leave it to the Singly team to do this for me.</p>
<p><a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a> made a slight shift in their branding recently, using the words <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">API Fabric</span></strong></em> in the description of what they do.  This seems like a slight change, but it truly is an exceptional way to describe the Singly approach to app development using social authentication and data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first glance, to a non technical person, fabric may be defined as:</p>
<blockquote><em><strong>fab&middot;ric/Ëfabrik/</strong> Noun: Cloth, typically produced by weaving or knitting textile fibers</em></blockquote>
<p>With synonyms being cloth, material, structure, textile, texture and web. Using this definition of fabric as the source for my analogy can work by itself.  It can help a non-technical person understand what is possible when you can quickly begin weave together apps using different APIs--visualizing some sort of woven textile, with unique meaning.  Immediately helping anyone, visually relate to the potential when developing on top of social and personal APIs.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/mayan-weaving.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>If you are more technical, the term &ldquo;fabric&rdquo; might help you understand Singly at another level. In information technology, fabric is a synonym for the words framework or platform.  In general, the term fabric can describe the way different parts of something work together to form a single entity.  Fabric can be used as a metaphor to illustrate the idea that if someone were to document computer components and their relationships on paper, the lines would weave back and forth so densely that the diagram would resemble a woven piece of cloth.</p>
<p>Bringing us back full circle to the visualization potentially related to non-developers.  The word fabric has deep meaning through our personal worlds, it might be your favorite jeans, blanket the uniform you wear to work every day.  APIs are fast being woven into every aspect of our lives, and the term &ldquo;fabric&rdquo; is an excellent way to relate what API providers like Singly are doing with specific groups of APIs, like personal and social data APIs.</p>
<p>Our sometimes very personal data and sometimes very public social data is fast becoming fabric of our daily personal and work worlds on the Internet and our mobile devices.  We are going to need to provide ways of assuring developers can build the most powerful, meaningful apps possible--by weaving together the best of breed data and resources into a strong API fabric!</p>

<p>The new Socrata Open Data Server is meant to be a reference for the <a title="open data standard" href="http://open-data-standards.github.com/">open data standard</a> they are actively evolving to promote data portability throughout open government data ecosystems, and support open source software policies in public organizations around the globe--called <a title="Open Data Substrate" href="http://open-data-standards.github.com/">The Open Data Substrate</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of the Socrata open source strategy is to enable customers to rapidly accelerate the process of breaking data out of traditional database &ldquo;silos,&rdquo; move it to the cloud and opening it for mass consumption to end users and developers. &nbsp;The Socrata Open Data Server will support the ongoing evolution of open data standards in three key areas, that Socrata feels are required for a thriving open data ecosystem:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Data Catalog Interoperability </strong>&ndash; Enable universal federation of different open data catalogs using a standard catalog schema, based on the W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)</li>
<li><strong>Data Portability Based on Standard Data Formats &ndash;</strong> Standardize outputs including JSON, XML, and CSV, as well as RDF and other Linked Data standards. The goal is to evolve towards standard schemas that developers can use for popular data sets, based on real-world examples and collaboration between data publishers</li>
<li><strong>Application Portability Based on Open Data API Standards &ndash; </strong>Standardize the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) used to programmatically access open data, using established paradigms and protocols such as REST, HTTP, and Structured Query Language (SQL)</li>
</ol>

<p>Socrata&rsquo;s move to open source their technology is in line with their mission:</p>
<blockquote><em>Socrata&rsquo;s mission is to help government organizations everywhere reap massive economic benefits from data liberation by promoting unfettered access, shareability, consumability and reuse of public data.</em></blockquote>
<p>And I share a similar vision with Socrata&rsquo;s CEO Kevin Merritt:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Socrata is constantly inventing new products that help people visualize and contextualize data in consumer-friendly web and mobile experiences, and as machine- and developer-ready APIs. We are part of a broader ecosystem that is creating massive downstream benefits and economic incentives for government to open the data floodgates,&rdquo; adds Kevin Merritt. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not enough to reduce friction in the supply of data, we also need to hardwire interoperability and data portability into the open data experience, to keep everybody honest and create a financially-sustainable business model for the entire ecosystem to thrive."</em></blockquote>
<p>We need all city, county, state and federal goverment to have APIs.  Let&rsquo;s not stand in the way.  The same can be said about the private sector--which is why I have been a <a href="/2012/06/11/where-is-the-open-source-api-platform/">proponent of more open source offerings in the API industry</a>.</p>
<p>The Socrata Open Data Server will be released in the first quarter of 2013, as freely downloadable open source software, but will also come fully integrated with other components of the company&rsquo;s commercial software products.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited by the opportunities for opening up government data with Socrata&rsquo;s approach, but we all have a lot of work to do.  We can&rsquo;t expect government to do it all alone.  Everyone needs to step up and help educated our local government about the potential of open data and APIs, and get involved and contribute to what Socrata has set into motion.</p>

<p>BandPage Connect provides a solid approach for the music industry to provide access to valuable band assets, but also provides a centralized way to control presence.  Ryan Kavontrka, Digital Manager for Maroon 5, Sara Bareilles, Gavin DeGraw, and Eve 6, says, "There are a lot of platforms out there that have our bio, photos, and videos, but the info they have about us is out of date and we don't have a way to change it. This makes it so that any member of a band or their manager/label can update the content, not just the guy who knows HTML. If you're connected with BandPage, you know your entire online presence is up-to-date."</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.bandpage.com/home"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/bandpage/BandPage-Developer-Portal.png" alt="" width="525" /></a></p>
<p>All a band has to do, is manage their presence via BandPage, and they can use BandPage Everywhere to allow any fan or partner to easily embed content on sites and social networks, as well as allowing developers to build custom experiences--all while maintaining control over every aspect of a bands presence.</p>
<p>After diving into BandPage Connect they&rsquo;ve done a great job launching the API, providing valuable endpoints, and all the <a href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">essential API building blocks so developers can be successful</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;building apps on the platform.  I think the BandPage approach to their embeddable and API strategy, is a model for other industries that showcase artists, to follow--giving them the highest level of control over their presence, while achieving the large distribution and presence possible in an API driven online and mobile world.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you saw the big news last week, but <a title="software publisher Axway announced intent to acquire API service provider Vordel" href="http://www.vordel.com/company/axway_acquires_vordel.html">software publisher Axway announced intent to acquire API service provider Vordel</a>.  I&rsquo;m not a big fan of covering funding, acquisition or launch press releases, unless there a significant business story there.  But the acquisition of Vordel is another important sign for the API industry in 2012.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deal haven&rsquo;t been disclosed, but the acquisition shows the API industry is maturing and producing desirable companies with proven API products, that larger software companies can use as a competitive advantage.  While Vordel's API management, SOA governance and identity management will help Axway&rsquo;s customers, I think Vordel&rsquo;s customers is probably the type of new client large software companies will want be also seeking out through acquisitions.</p>

<p>I always joke with John and Adam at <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> about, &ldquo;Is this the year of the API&rdquo;? They have been at it longer than I have, and are very hesitant to dub any particular year, the year of the API.  But, with the growth we&rsquo;ve seen in 2012, two open source API management platforms deployed and now a major acquisition in the space--I confidently would say 2012 is the year APIs came of age.</p>
<p>I predict in 2013-2015 we are going to see more of these types of acquisitions occuring.  Large software companies are going to need a robust set of API tools to bring legacy systems into the modern, API driven economy.  Companies that have invested in API management service providers like <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a> and <a title="Mashape" href="http://mashape.com">Mashape</a> will see the return they are looking for, as the space continues to grow in the next five years.</p>

<p>When you operate an API, you need to make sure and communicate with your developer community about what your plans are for the future, so developers can plan their own roadmap, and keep in sync with the coming changes to the API.</p>
<p>In addition to <a title="API issue management with Github" href="/2012/11/08/api-issue-management-using-github/">issue management using Github</a>, API providers can use Github to manage their roadmap using the milestones features of the social coding platform.  Milestones can be directly related to issues or can be larger goals around where you intend to take your API.</p>
<p>Milestones give developers insight into what the plans are the future of an API, using just a title, description and target date.  Milestones are one of the simplest aspects of an API, but can go a long way in creating goodwill with your developers.</p>
<p>API providers have to balance transparency versus giving away information to competitors, something that will take regular consideration.  A transparent roadmap for your API will let developers prepare properly, while also letting them know what features are coming in the future--eliminating the possibility of competing with your own ecosystem.</p>
<p>Consider what you can include in your Github roadmap, and using Github for issue management.</p>

<p>CloudMine is delivering on the BaaS promise and providing all the tools developers need to rapidly develop and scale their mobile applications, by providing a complete backend solution for developers including user management, object storage, push notifications, syncing and other essential tools developers need to be successful.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/53044170?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0" width="500" height="281"></iframe></p>

<p>Social is the logical next step in the BaaS evolution.  Social authentication, data, friends, followers are also essential for any developer building an app these days, so the partnership being CloudMine and Singly makes sense.  Instead of CloudMine aggregating these essential social tools, they can rely on Singly to bring this to the table for CloudMine developers--allowing CloudMine to stick with what they do best.</p>

<p>Mobile app development is at the center of API deployment in 2012.  Much of the interest in designing, developing and deploying APIs is so that you can successfully launch one, or multiple mobile applications.</p>
<p>I get a lot of questions from companies looking to deploy APIs, where they can find development talent that will help them with their API driven mobile initiatives.  Up until now I didn&rsquo;t have much to offer them, any mobile developer I know that is good, is already snatched up, and without direct experience deploying projects with a development shop, I didn&rsquo;t have one to recommend.</p>
<p>Now that has changed, I&rsquo;ve been working with a rock star web and mobile dev shop called <a href="http://concentricsky.com/">Concentric Sky</a>. And over the last couple years I have really gotten to know their team of developers and management--and I&rsquo;ve been blown away by some of the projects they are producing:</p>

        <p><a href="http://defragcon.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/defrag-2012/Defrag-2012-Conference.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was trying to explain the experience of being at the <a href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag Conference</a>, to a friend&nbsp;the other day.  We are both gearing up for the event, next week (November 14th &amp; 15th), in Broomfield Colorado, and he had never been to one so I wanted to share a little about what the experience is like.</p>
<p>The Defrag event is organized by Eric Norlin, who also organizes Gluecon and Blur conferences, all at the Omni Interlocken resort in Broomfield.  Each of Eric&rsquo;s events have evolved each year, but currently reflect the following focus:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://gluecon.com/2012/">Gluecon</a></strong> - Cloud, Mobile, APIs, Big Data for developers</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag</a></strong> - What's coming next  in technology</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.blurcon.com/">Blur</a></strong> - Human Computer Interaction (HCI)</li>
</ul>
<p>Eric has a unique way of bringing together the leaders from the space to discuss relevant technologies in a very intimate space.  The Omni Interlocken resort is a very key element to the events, which makes it unlike other events I attend.</p>
<p>The first of Eric&rsquo;s events I attended was a Gluecon, several years back.  We drove out to the location, and I remember thinking, &ldquo;oh man we are going to be stuck way out here for 4 days&rdquo;.  But as I learned, that is the point.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/defrag-2012/Omni-Interlocken.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p>You are stuck in a very intimate location where you will eat killer grub, including beef sliders and drink some kick-ass craft beers while rubbing elbows and having deep technical and philosophical conversations with the deepest thinkers and leaders in our space.</p>
<p>Defrag and Glue are part of a small group of events I recommend you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span></strong> miss in the space.  I&rsquo;m pretty burnt out on large technology conferences, but the value you walk away with from Defrag can&rsquo;t be found anywhere else--putting Defrag in entireley different category for me.</p>
<p>I hope to see you at Defrag next week. If your there, I&rsquo;ll buy you an IPA, while we talk APIs.</p>

<p>One great use of Github is as an API issue management tool.  The Github issue management system allows you to easily accept issue reports from your API community and apply labels to organize them into appropriate categories, for processing by your development team.</p>
<p>To setup Github Issue Management for your API, just create a new repository, but you won't actually being pushing any code, you will just be using it as a container for running issue management.  Think of it as repository for your API itself.</p>
<p>Once setup, you can link the issue management page directly from your API area, allowing users to actively submit issues, comment and potentially be part of the API product development cycle.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> isn't just for code.  Github can be used for HTML documents and PDF's as well.  This opens up endless possibilities for management of documents you wish to share with your developer ecosystem.</p>
<p>One excellent example of this is publishing presentations from the various talks, hackathons and conferences you present at.  When you are done with a talk and would like to share with your community, you can just expose it as a PDF or HTML document, and push to Github.</p>
<p>You can also use this same approach for how-to guides and training materials you want to make available for your developers.  Allowing them to download and fork, or even follow the changes on Github, for the richest training materials an API provides.</p>
<p>Github provides a powerful way for you to version, evolve and share your essential API resources with the community--keeping them in sync with all other activity around your API.</p>

<p>I've heard Gil talk several times, and I am a big believer in his views on data, and supporter of <a href="http://www.factual.com/">Factual as a platform</a>. I firmly believe we can help companies and government draw proper conclusions, in very real-time ways, using APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/funnel.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>When it comes to measuring the success of an API, we often experience a lack meaningful metrics, with <a title="many companies only tracking the number of new developers and quantity of API calls" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/15/developing-more-meaningful-api-metrics/">many companies only tracking the number of new developers and quantity of API calls</a>.  Going beyond these basic API metrics and identifying true performance indicators (KPI), will be essential if you want to find success with your API.</p>
<p>To speak in a more traditional marketing sense, a pretty standard sales funnel can be used to set the stage, defining the intake of developers as the top of your funnel, paid accounts and production applications the bottom of your APIs funnel--giving you a common framework for hanging KPIs on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when using a sales funnel to frame your API marketing efforts, be careful of being blinded that success will all be all about moving developers from the top, to the bottom of your funnel.  While this is definitely a large part of your efforts, there are plenty of good things that can happen within the funnel that will further drive users into the funnel as well as build trust and evangelism efforts that can be essential to the growth of your API ecosystem.</p>
<p>When planning your API sales funnel, the top is all about bringing in new registrations and the bottom should reflect the business objectives of your API.  But your funnel flow shouldn't always consist of direct flow to the bottom--think about what other beneficial activities can happen within the funnel:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Talent Acquisition</strong> -   Finding new developers who understand your API and market</li>
<li><strong>Social Media Marketing</strong> - Tweets and other social media exhaust for users</li>
<li><strong>Story Building</strong> - New stories you can tell about the value your API delivers</li>
<li><strong>Idea Generation</strong> - Creative ideas around how to use your API</li>
<li><strong>Feedback</strong> - Quality feedback from developers about how to make your API better</li>
<li><strong>Evangelists</strong> - Develop the next generation of developer evangelists and advocates</li>
<li><strong>Brand</strong> - Awareness of your brand and the value it represents</li>
<li><strong>Trust</strong> - The trust of developers who will use your API to solve problems in the future</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these activities can boost the strength of your operations, others can feed the bottom line and meet your funnel objectives, but all of them will work to bring more developers into the top of the funnel--helping you scale.</p>
<p>To properly define your API funnel, you need to begin by profiling developers, as they come in the door, and try to figure out where they fit.  Don&rsquo;t assume all developers will be there to build production ready app and drive revenue for your company.  Developers come in all shapes and sizes.  Get to know your developers, who they are and understand where they fit into the equation.  Don&rsquo;t scare off developers who can benefit the ecosystem with an aggressive sales approach..</p>
<p>When establishing and evolving the key performance indicators for your API, make sure be developer centric in your measurements and decisions--don&rsquo;t make them just about monetization and the bottom line.  If you optimize for developer success, when it comes to web APis you&rsquo;ll often find success in all other areas of your API operations.</p>

<p>I call it being an evangelist, but it has other names, such as advocate or ambassador.  Someone who is good at evangelism, in my opinion, starts with a love of hacking but is also having a love of helping others learn and understand technology.  I can&rsquo;t help being an evangelist, it&rsquo;s just part of my personality.</p>
<p>These days, I get enough requests for evangelists, so I decided to start finding passionate hackers within specific communities to help fill requests.  Some requests for evangelists are full time positions, some part time, while others involve just going to meetups and hackathons in evenings and on weekends as needed.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m on the hunt for some passionate hacker personalities in New York, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Austin, Atlanta and Portland.  If you live in these cities, are passionate about API, mobile, social and the cloud--you should consider a life of evangelism.</p>
<p>Even if you aren&rsquo;t quite sure what an evangelist, advocate or ambassador does, feel free to reach out.  Chances are you are already attending meetups, hackathons and already doing evangelism activities--you just aren&rsquo;t getting paid or receiving incentives to do so.</p>

<p>One very powerful way to use <a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> within your API strategy is for developer profiling.  This approach requires the deployment of another Github solution, API <a title="Developer login using Github" href="/2012/10/29/api-developer-login-using-github/">Developer login using Github</a>.</p>
<p>After you implement authentication for you API using Github, the <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/github">Github API</a> provides a wealth of opportunity for you to learn more about developers.</p>
<p>The types of developers you want for your API are also developers who have an active Github profiles.  Using Github, you can immediately tell if someone is an active developer based upon their presence and usage of the social coding network.</p>
<p>Github provides basic profile details, like where a developer lives and which programming language they use.  You can also see which other tools and code they following and commit to, giving an overall profile of their developer lifestyle.</p>
<p>Using Github you will also be able to tell if a user has downloaded or forked your own API SDK's, giving you insight into how well your SDK"s are being received and used.   There are endless ways you can use Github to stay in tune with your developers, but first you have to employ <a title="Github authentication as part of your API strategy" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/09/05/provide-api-developers-with-github-login-using-singly/">Github authentication as part of your API strategy</a>--then get to work profiling developers, and better understand who they are.</p>

        <p>I spend a lot of time trying to find company logos and a little blurb about what a company does. &nbsp;You'd think in this cloudy API driven world there would a simpler way. &nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/electronic-frontier-foundation/electronic-frontier-foundation-logo.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/no-copyrights-apis-help-us-make-case">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) needs our help</a> to explain to the Federal Circuit Court on why there should <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span></strong> be copyrights on APIs.  As EFF published today:</p>
<blockquote><em>Earlier this year, we applauded District Court Judge Alsup for getting it right and holding that, as a matter of law, one could not copyright APIs. The case, Oracle v. Google, is now on appeal to the Federal Circuit, where a three-judge panel is going to revisit Judge Alsup&rsquo;s ruling.</em></blockquote>
<p>The EFF is soliciting the our assistance in how to help build the case, asking for feedback on two example areas:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Software reimplementing someone else&rsquo;s API, calling someone else&rsquo;s API, or any other uses of third-party APIs for interoperability, competition, or innovation.</li>
<li>Reimplementation of an API, where the resulting software benefitted the original API creator, perhaps by increasing the creator&rsquo;s user base or otherwise benefitted the developer community</li>
</ol>
<p>I think we are in the infancy of API deployment, so it&rsquo;s going to be tough to find many solid examples. &nbsp;But I think the two areas we can demonstrate the importance of no copyright on APIs, is within two business sectors that evolved on the web, using APIs and are critical to business and government today:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Cloud</strong> - As EFF said, Eucalyptus reimplemented the Amazon API to offer a competing cloud storage service.  You also saw the same with <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/09/01/google-storage-for-developers-interoperability/">first implementation of Google Developer Storage</a> and up to &amp; other providers: <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/dunkel">Dunkel Cloud Storage</a>, <a href="http://www.hosteurope.de/produkte/Cloud-Storage">âHost Europe Cloud Storage</a>, <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/greenqloud">GreenQloud Storage Qloud</a>, <a href="http://www.scaleupcloud.com/">ScaleUp Technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.mh.connectria.com/rp/order/cloud_storage_index">âConnectria Cloud Storage</a>, <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/lunacloud">Lunacloud</a>, and <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/dreamobjects">DreamObjects Cloud Storage</a>&nbsp;providing unprecedented interoperability for cloud computing.</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Same as with cloud you have seen competition pop up for both Twitter and Facebook, mimicking their platform and APIs.  Platforms like <a title="App.net" href="https://join.app.net/">App.net</a> have copied Twitter&rsquo;s social network providing competition, and potential value to Twitter users by allowing developers to use App.net for things they can't use Twitter for.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think another clear example of open API design being used to help users is Pinboard&rsquo;s implementation of the Delicious API:</p>
<ol class="mainlist"> 
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="85" align="center" valign="top"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pinboard/pinboard-icon.png" alt="" width="75" /></td>
<td><strong><a title="Pinboard" href="http://pinboard.in/api/">Pinboard</a></strong> - Wherever possible the Pinboard API uses the same syntax and method names as the Delicious V1 API. This implementation allowed users to seamlessly export Delicious bookmarks accumulated over several years to Pinboard when Delicious was sold by Yahoo. &nbsp;If Yahoo had copyrighted their API design, Pinboard could never have done this.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</ol>
<p>A slightly different approach to offering benefit to users via an open API design is surrounding the Instagram API:</p>
<ol class="mainlist"> 
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="85" align="center" valign="top"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/instagram/instagram-icon-250.png" alt="" width="75" /></td>
<td><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/02/08/instagram-launches-api/">Instagram API </a></strong>- In 2010, before Instagram itself launched an API, a passionate developer launched a rogue API for the popular photo sharing platform based upon Instagram's own internal API design they used to drive the popular iPhone application.  The move showed Instagram the demand for an API, and after designing and launching their own asked the rogue API to shut down.  A slightly different scenario, but if API design was copyright this may not have been possible.  We&rsquo;ve seen the same approach with a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/25/lack-of-pinterest-api-is-a-lack-of-api-business-strategy/">rogue Pinterest API</a>, but it hasn&rsquo;t resulted in the same response from Pinterest unfortunately.   But community driven API design has a lot of potential for opening up companies and encouraging API innovation.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</ol>
<p>I strongly believe that APIs have massive potential for innovation across many business sectors.  The copyright of API design would eliminate much of this potential.  Open API design allows for healthy competition, interoperability and innovation as we&rsquo;ve seen with cloud and social.  But open API design can also augment the lack of standards through market leadership, helping grow healthy industries and essential online utilities.  Amazon EC2 and S3 design standards are clear examples of this in the wild.</p>
<p>Cloud and social are fast become essential components in our everyday lives, but open API have the potential to become mission critical with implementations like <a href="http://open311.org/">Open311</a>.  Some API designs are just too important to be proprietary.   I would argue Twitter, Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2 also fall into this category and need to remain open for the greater good.</p>
<p>Open API design reuse represents the future of API communication.  Companies like <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a>, <a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com/">Temboo</a>, <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell</a> and <a title="Zapier" href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> are building API aggregation, automation, and languages that very much rely on flexible API terms of use, as well as API design reuse.  Copyright of API design would prevent companies from openly competing, offering redunancy as well as limit new and more meaningful APIs to be derived from existing API implementations.</p>
<p>Without the ability to copy, mimic, mashup, translate, emulate and re-define API design we won&rsquo;t be able to become more fluent in communicating via web and mobile apps using APIs.  We are just beginning to understand online communication via the power of mobile apps.  As we still grunt and groan while communicating via APIs--let&rsquo;s not stunt our growth and development with allowing API design to be copyrighted.</p>

        <p>Dear API Strategy Attendee,<br /><br />As you know we've been tracking the weather events affecting New York. Up until now we've been hoping to run the event much as planned and working around the logistics issues that have come up.<br /><br />We were hoping for better news this morning but the situation in New York is still very serious with extensive storm damage, mass-transit and airports with uncertain reopening times and in some areas there are still emergency rescue situations on-going. There has already been significant travel disruption and it looks set to get worse (none of the event team has yet been been able to get to New York and a number of speakers are already unable to fly).<br /><br />As a result we've had to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">take the tough decision to postpone the event and not run it this week</span>. It's very dissapointing for everybody we realize (not least the team) and we'd wanted to fight through and make everything work but as of this time:<br /><br />- We don't think we'd be able to run much of the program and hence the event would<br />&nbsp; not reach the great potential it had.<br /><br />- There are safety concerns and for people traveling very possible serious travel chaos.<br /><br />Lastly, people on the ground in the city likely have other things to focus on than the event - staying safe and securing everything.<br /><br />So if you were planning to travel, please do not - the event won't take place unfortunately. However, this is a postponement and the event will definitely take place - we're committed to making it happen and making it happen in New York. We will get back to you with new dates and consultation in the next few days.<br /><br />We will certainly work with speakers and sponsors to make sure the program is just as good and likely even better + we'll aim to do it as proximately as possible given people's logistics.<br /><br />All tickets will remain valid for the new event when it runs, however if dates do not fit for you we will reimburse you. We'll keep you posted on that news.<br /><br />Our apologies from the team that we've had to take this decision but we really see no other option. We'll be back with news as soon as we can on a new date / time / venue and in the meantime we hope everybody stays safe.<br /><br />We thank everybody for the awesome support and advice -<br /><br />Kin, Steve and Vanessa</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/github/github-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />As with most social platforms, <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> provides oAuth for their platform, allowing developers to provide secure credentials and authentication for their users via a Github account.</p>
<p>Service providers like <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a> are providing two click authentication using Github's oAuth.  This allows any website or app to offer their users the ability to login with their Github profile.</p>
<p>Allowing authentication via Github is no brainer for API providers. Why require users to create yet another login, or even use <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a> oAuth?  Allow them to login and retrieve API keys via the one social profile that reflects the programmer side of their online profile.</p>
<p>Github login can be implemented in any programming language, and because it is oAuth, it is something end users will understand.  In addition to providing easy authentication, you will be able to immediately see other important data about a developer that is available via their Github profile.</p>
<p>Consider the potential of using Github authentication as part of your API strategy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><a title="Pearson" href="http://developer.pearson.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/pearson/pearson-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One API I&rsquo;ve been watching grow and evolve from day one is the <a title="Pearson Developer Community" href="http://developer.pearson.com/">Pearson Developer Community</a>.  I first wrote about them when Peasron <a title="announced a new initiative to build an API platform that give developers access to the publisher's content" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/10/pearson-plans-api-platform-to-unlock-content/">announced a new initiative to build an API platform that give developers access to the publisher's content</a> in May of 2011.  Then in <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/08/16/re-inventing-pearson-publishing-using-apis/">August 2011 they launched three APIs</a>:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/longman-dictionary/apimethod/get-entry-0/189/overview">Longman Dictionary</a></strong> - The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English is the flagship Longman dictionary</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/ft-press/apimethod/get-book-block/189/overview">FT Press</a></strong> - FT Press provides essential insights from the best business books and original writings by leading business thinkers</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/eyewitness-guides/apimethod/entries-guide/189/overview">Eyewitness Guides</a> </strong>- The DK Eyewitness Travel Guides show you what others only tell you</li>
</ul>
<p>After Pearson got acquainted with the ins and outs of API evangelism, and supporting the Pearson developer community, they <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/18/launching-apis-one-book-at-a-time/">released two more APIs</a> this year:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/pearson-kitchen-manager/apimethod/courses/190/overview">Pearson Kitchen Manager</a> </strong>- Pearson Kitchen Manager is a valuable resource for food enthusiasts and chefs alike, featuring a vast collection of recipes from bestselling Pearson textbooks of top culinary schools</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/nursing-health-survival-guides-api/apimethod/get-article/189/overview">Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guides API</a> </strong>- The best-selling Pearson Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guide series is the UK's premier quick reference, aide memoire support for health and social care students and professionals while in practice and studying</li>
</ul>
<p>It looks like Pearson is really finding a rhythm with identifying content to make available, as well as the right approach to deploying as APIs. They have 3 more high value publishing APIs available:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/penguin-classics-api/apimethod/get-article-1/189/overview">Penguin Classics API </a></strong>- The Penguin English Library is a collection of 100 of the best novels ever written in the English Language. Classics like Jane Eyre, Dracula and Great Expectations </li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/dkimages-api/apimethod/list-images/189/overview">dkimages API</a> </strong>- The dkimages API is an encyclopaedic collection of 90,000 high-resolution images</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/peachpit-visual-quickstart-guides-api/apimethod/get-article-0/190/overview">Peachpit Visual QuickStart Guides API</a></strong> - With more than 12 million copies in print, Visual QuickStart Guides have been a vital part of the computer book category for years</li>
</ul>
<p>That is a total of 8 APIs endpoints Pearson has made available via their developer center--providing some valuable text and image content that developers can use to build web and mobile apps.</p>
<p>What impresses me with Pearson is that they&rsquo;ve found an efficient way to identify valuable assets within legacy inventory, part them out and expose these valuable parts and pieces as APIs.  Essentially giving them a new life--driving web, mobile and tablet applications.</p>
<p>Pearson has deployed their developer center with all the <a title="essential API building blocks" href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">essential API building blocks</a>, while also executing an efficient API evangelism campaign around their APis, and delivering value to developers.  It&rsquo;s a commendable operation for such a big publisher.</p>
<p>If you are interested in hearing more about what Pearson is up to with their APIs, you can catch them at the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference this week in NYC</a>.  Pearson will be presenting as part of a media API session as well as helping sponsor the event, to make sure we can all get together an have these conversations.</p>

<p>Code samples in a variety of languages are how API owners help developers understand an API in the language that makes the most sense to them.</p>
<p>Not all developers will understand REST, HTTP and other things you might take for granted.  Very simple code samples will help demonstrate an APIs functionality, making the learning process a hands-on experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> provides a very lightweight tool for publishing API code samples, that can be embedded on any website, called <a title="Gist" href="https://gist.github.com/">Gists</a>.  You can easily copy / paste a working code sample into a Gist and Github returns a lightweight, embeddable JavaScript that you can use in documentation, blog posts and any where you will need to share with users.</p>
<p>Github Gists can be a much sexier, and easier to implement alternative to html &lt;code&gt; tags. While also allowing easy management and versioning of API code samples alongside <a title="Github API SDK Management" href="/2012/10/25/sdk-management-for-your-api-with-github/">Github API SDK repositories</a>.</p>

<p>The most common use of <a title="Github" href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> by API providers is to publish API SDK's to the popular social coding platform.  If you look at most of the the top API providers in operation today, you will find they are actively using Github to not just manage and publicize their API SDK's, but actively interact with their developer ecosystem in the process.</p>
<p>Github provides the necessary workflow for initial design, development and publicizing of API SDKs, allowing owners to create separate repositories for web-based SDKs like PHP, Python and Ruby and mobile SDKs for iOS, Android and Windows mobile.</p>
<p>By making API SDK's public repositories on Github you get all the code management benefits of Github, but also make them available for social interaction by your developers.  They will be able to download, fork and potentially commit additions and modifications back to an SDK's repository, allowing owners to harness the creative potential of the developer community.</p>
<p>Active Github repositories for an API are an essential part of any API ecosystem.  If you don't use Github for anything else, make sure you publish your SDK's as a public repository. It will make the development of your client libraries a much more social experience, providing huge benefits for your API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><a title="APIPhany" href="http://www.apiphany.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/APIphany-Logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I get so busy sometimes my stories pile up. Some only seeing the light of day when I get caught up on research, projects, travels and speaking. On story I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write for almost 3 months now is about <a title="APIPhany" href="http://www.apiphany.com/">APIphany</a>, one of the new generation of API providers.  I met the APIphany team in person when I went out to Washington DC in August.</p>
<p>The APIphany team was cool enough to come out and support my <a title="API Craft Washington DC" href="/2012/08/18/api-craft-washington-dc/">API Craft meetup in DC</a>, then the next morning I went out to their offices and met the rest of the team.  APIphany sees the industry very similar to me, and believe in self-service, pay as you go API services that allow for anyone to innovate around APIs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching their progress and they have 3 very cool projects made public so far:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.washingtonpost.com/">Washington Post</a> -</strong> Developer area for Washington Post, providing some endpoints including an Issue Engine API, White House Visitors Log API,  and the Campaign Finance API</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.ridemetro.apiphany.com/">Houston Metro</a> -</strong> Developer portal for the Houston area, providing public transit in the Houston metropolitan area for bus and rail</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.votinginfoproject.org/">The Voting Information Project (VIP)</a> </strong>- Offering APIs and developers tools to provide voters with access to customized election information, helping them navigate the voting process and cast an informed vote</li>
</ul>
<p>When I met the team in August, they described how they were building out so many custom projects for customers that were API driven, they decided to standardize their approach and offer a product.  The APIphany API management solution provides all the standard offerings we are getting used to in the space:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-team.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Administration Portal</li>
<li>Developer Portal</li>
<li>Key Management</li>
<li>Access Control and Security</li>
<li>Subscriptions and Billing</li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
<li>Analytics and Reporting</li>
</ul>
<p>APIphany also gives you the ability to host the API in a variety of cloud providers, and my favorite is they provide you with an API to manage your API.  The team has been building and managing web APIs for government, enterprise, and non-profit customers since 2006--so they get it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apiphany.com/">APIphany</a> is also supporting the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> in New York City, November 1st and 2nd.  If you want to meet the team, you should make sure your there--if not just head over to <a title="apiphany.com" href="http://apiphany.com">apiphany.com</a> to talk with them directly.</p>

<p>While I was <a href="/2012/10/24/my-presentation-to-the-presidential-innovation-fellows/">out in Washington DC this week</a>, one of the Presidential Innovation Fellows in my workshop was from the Department of Energy, and shared one of the best examples of APIs delivering value I&rsquo;ve seen in awhile.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bioenergykdf.net/">US Department of Energy has developed the Bioenergy Knowledge Discovery Framework</a> (KDF), which is a platform for researchers and engineers from national laboratories, academia, and private industries to upload files, customize information online, and exchange knowledge with each other.</p>
<p>The Bioenergy Knowledge Discovery Framework provides acess to a landmark &ldquo;Billion-Ton&rdquo; bioenergy study on fuel resources, providing a wealth of information from a variety of researchers.   The study generated a large volume of interest, and resulted in numerous requests for raw data disclosure from the researchers.</p>
<p>In response the project deployed a web API, providing direct access to raw data, saving the resources necessary to reach out to researchers as well as the researchers valuable time in processing requests and providing data.</p>
<p>The US Department of Energy estimates they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">saved $882,000</span> in operational costs and researchers valuable time by bundling the API with the bioenergy study.</p>
<p>This is why I evangelize APIs.  The US Department of Energy case study demonstrates not just the value of APIs, but how they can actually make government more efficient and save tax payers money.</p>
<p>In addition I strongly advocate that&nbsp;<a title="APIs and raw data access should be default" href="http://kinlane.com/2012/05/15/diving-deeper-into-data-from-research/">APIs and raw data access should be default</a> for all studies and resulting reports, allowing anyone to dive deeper into the research and provide additional insights.</p>

<p>Out of date API documentation is by far the most common mistake API providers make, and also the <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/08/12/web-api-documentation-best-practices/">number one pain point for API developers</a>.  It makes sense that you will want to keep your API documentation in sync with each version of your API, and one way to handle this is to version them both, using Github.</p>
<p>To use Github for your API documentation, all you need to do is create an single public repository, which you can use to manage HTML versions of your API docs.  By putting your API documentation in its own repository you can keep the version of the API code repository in sync with it's corresponding documentation.</p>
<p>With the API documentation in Github, you can then easily publish to your API area or just allow developers to go directly to the Github repository and browse documentation there.</p>
<p>To help you edit your API documentation, you can use tools like <a href="http://prose.io/">prose.io</a>,&nbsp;which will allow even non-developers to assist in maintaining API documentation, with all changes stored neatly in a central Github repository.</p>
<p>Storing API docs in Github will also make them more portable.  Some developers may wish to download a copy for offline work, or just prefer having locally for their own reference.</p>
<p>With the right approach to managing your API docs with Github, you can easily keep them up to date, in sync with your API, while also making them easily accessible by all API consumers--without much of the headache often associated with managing API documentation.</p>

<p>I spent two hours with a handful of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows">Presidential Innovation Fellows</a> in Washington DC yesterday.  They were some super savvy folks from a wide variety of agencies and backgrounds including education, energy and health.</p>
<p>During my two hours with them I walked through several areas of  the API industry, from my perspective, including:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>History of APIs</li>
<li>API Planning &amp; Design</li>
<li>API Development</li>
<li>Business of APIs</li>
<li>API Service Providers</li>

If you&rsquo;d like a custom presentation on it, let me know and I&rsquo;ll see if I can find a slot to do a Google Hangout.</p>
<p>I had a blast talking to the Presidential Fellows, and I hope that I left them with some value that will help them be successful in their various initiatives.  They are already halfway through their sprint, and have a lot of expectations put on them.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/federal-government/government-owners-uncle-sam.jpeg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had a great discussion with a friend who works in federal government yesterday.  We were talking about various ways to &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">successfully</span>&rdquo; deploy APIs within the federal government.  She gets APIs, understands the benefits, but she had some very realistic perspectives on where API deployment within the federal government can fail.</p>
<p>While discussing this with her, we kept coming back to two points:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Garbage Littering the Internet</strong> - With some of the tools, making it easier to deploy APIs, the potential to just post meaningless and worthless data sets grows</li>
<li><strong>Lack of API Ownership </strong>- There are big movements to get APIs deployed, but then very little ownership once its up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding worthless APIs being deployed, I think we can mitigate this by providing some sort of ranking or voting systems for APIs, allowing developers to upvote or downvote and add some critical feedback on what is right, or what is wrong.  This will allow the &ldquo;cream&rdquo; to rise to the top, and everything else just disappear from view.</p>
<p>Next, her perspective on lack of API ownership after an API is launched, is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very big problem</span>.  It is something I see in the public sector all the time.  Everyone gets excited about standing up an API, but once it&rsquo;s in the wild, they lose enthusiasm--leaving the API to whither on the vine.</p>
<p>APIs will not succeed if they do not have an owner.  For technology companies, it might make sense for them to have an API as a product, assemble a team and dedicate resources to the API. &nbsp;Even hire an evangelist or advocate.</p>
<p>When it comes to government, maybe we need a different approach.  A sort of personal API deployment platform like <a title="Socrata API Foundry" href="http://www.socrata.com/api-foundry/">Socrata API Foundry</a>, that will let anyone publish a dataset as API--allowing any individual to achieve "machine readable by default", as <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">directed by President Obama back in May</a>.</p>
<p>By empowering data owners within government to publish themselves, and give them the tools to handle the business of their APIs, and interact directly with consumers, maybe we can ensure APIs have an owner--one that cares about the data and truly understand the value it offers.</p>
<p>Just some quick thoughts, from a great conversation.  I will flush out more ideas on this as soon as I can.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/10/24/a-hackathon-philosophy-from-warren-wilbee-of-microsoft/">A Hackathon Philosophy From Warren Wilbee of Microsoft</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/wwilbee" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/microsoft/warren-wilbee-microsoft.jpeg" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>While doing the weekly hackathon roundup in September, I noticed an uptick in the number of <a title="Windows 8 Hackathons" href="http://whosin.com/pg/whois/20074247/Warren+Wilbee">Windows 8 hackathons</a> that are going on.  I decided to reach out to Microsoft and see if I can get more information on what they are trying to accomplish, and see what their perspective is on hackathons.</p>
<p>After talking to several people I was directed to a gentleman by the name of Warren Wilbee (<a href="https://twitter.com/wwilbee" target="_blank">@wwilbee</a>), Director of ISV Evangelism at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a>.  Wilbee is a passionate evangelist, one that isn't just externally evangelizing, he is actively working to evolve internal culture and options about the value of hackathons at Microsoft.  When I got on the phone with him, he said the reason I was directed to him is because he had recently circulated an internal memo regarding the makeup and value of hackathons.</p>
<p>He feels strong that hackathons are very useful, you get the opportunity to get X number of people into a room, doing exactly what you want--delivering a very direct result. "Hackathons are purpose built", when you put on a hackathon for developers you get to define exactly what you, sending the desired message your company wants developers to receive, says Wilbee. By contrast, sponsoring a hackathon is a very different exercise and value proposition--proceed with caution.  The hackathon organizer gets to define the purpose and drive the outcomes. The sponsor will not have access to this value, potentially excluding you from all the marketing or social "halo" produced at the event.  Sometimes there are opportunities to offer a prize that will be in-line with the organizers purpose, but just flashing your logo will not deliver much value to your company.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.devcamps.ms/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/microsoft/windows-8-hackathons.jpeg" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>When you do put on a hackathon, Wilbee is passionate about it being a "participatory event". Get your people to come and participate, don't just require them to show up, make it part of their responsibility to be involved.  There is a social and community aspect to hackathons, "the shared experience of being in a room at 3am, committed to a common goal is a galvanizing, bonding experience." This is something you get by just showing up for a short period of time or just sponsoring an event.</p>
<p>In Wilbee&rsquo;s opinion APIs and software platforms are here to stay, and hackathons do a great job educating people about the value they deliver.  We will definitely see more organized efforts around these types of events, across many business sectors, in the future.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/10/22/open-source-your-api-with-github/">Open Source Your API With Github</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><a title="Github" href="https://github.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/github/github-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a>&nbsp;is a frequently used service in the toolbox of API owners.  The most common use of Github is for publishing API SDKs in a variety of languages and platforms.  But when it comes to truly being an "open API", some API owners are actually open sourcing their API design using Github.</p>
<p>Open sourcing the design of your API will not be sensible for every provider.  Many companies are looking to ensure developers use their API, maintaining an advantage over competitors.  However in some cases, open sourcing the design of your API is a way to ensure interoperability between partners or among mutliple companies within a certain business sector.</p>
<p>Simple examples of an API design might be for common systems like blogs, news, links, calendars or other API designs that don't deliver any sort of proprietary offerings.  If you are looking to ensure synchronicity between say, the calendar of multiple organizations, developing a single API and open sourcing the design and possibly a version of it in multiple programming languages, might make sense.</p>
<p>With a consistent API design, and code to deploy the API, any organization can download or fork the Github code, deploy the API for themselves--ensuring consistency and interoperability between any deployment. If a single organizations has unique needs, they can extend and commit the code back to Github, allowing the central repository manager to decide if it is a change that should be added to the core offering.</p>
<p>Not all APIs are created equal. &nbsp;Consider the possibility of actually open sourcing your API, the benefits it might bring to others, as well as your organization--they might exceed keeping it closed and proprietary.</p>
<p>This approach to using Github, is by far the truest meaning of the word, "Open API".</p>

<p>When <a href="/2012/10/20/the-right-partnership-for-the-api-strategy--practice-conference/">3Scale and I first decided to do the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> in New York, one of the first people I reached out to about speaking and sponsoring the event, was Laura Merling (<a href="https://twitter.com/magicmerl">@magicmerl</a>), SVP Applications Enablement Platform and Strategy at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/open-api-platform/">Alcatel-Lucent</a>.</p>
<p>As soon as I told her about the event, she said &ldquo;We are in! What do we need to do, to support it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stoked to have Laura kick off the event on Thursday, November 1st with a keynote as well as having <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sponsors.php">Alcatel-Lucent as a gold sponsor.</a></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve never heard Laura speak, I highly recommend making sure you are there.  She always has great insight into the success Alcatel-Lucent is having within emerging markets and the telco space. &nbsp;Also, her talks are always positive, energetic and demonstrate leadership in the space--something I want my daughter Kaia to experience.</p>
<p>During Laura&rsquo;s keynote I&rsquo;m sure we will here more about <a href="/2012/09/06/alcatel-lucent-open-sources-their-api-management-platform/">Alcatel-Lucent's new open source offering, API Grove</a>, as well as their openly licensed <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/16/alcatel-lucent-creates-methodology-for-apis-and-makes-available-under-creative-commons/">API lifecycle and methodology</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure you <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">get registered</a> today, before the event is sold out--there aren&rsquo;t many tickets left. &nbsp;I'll see you there.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> is kicking off in 12 days in New York City.  The event will be keynotes, sessions and panels from over <a title="60 leading individuals across all sectors of the API industry" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">60 leading individuals across all sectors of the API industry</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to have an API industry event that was about ideas, practice and strategy, not just about companies, their products and clients for a while now.  This is something that I could never achieve on my own.  I just don&rsquo;t have the money or all the connections to bring everyone together.</p>
<p>To make API Strategy &amp; Practice happen it took the right partnership.  That partnership is with <a title="API service provider 3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net/">API service provider 3Scale</a>.  The 3Scale team views the industry much like I do, that by openly educating people about the benefits of APIs and discussing the technical, business and political challenges we face in the industry--we can truly make change across all business sectors. &nbsp;Allowing all of us to be succesful in whatever products and services we provide.</p>
<p>Through the regular discussion I have with the 3Scale team, we discovered our shared desire to have such an API industry event.  We discussed what the event would look like, then quickly started figuring out what it would take to make it happen.  We felt we both had resources necessary to pull it off, and even though there is a lot of risk, that it was something that had to happen, for the benefit of the industry.</p>
<p>Here we are, 8 weeks later, and the event is a reality.   I just wanted to say thanks to 3Scale for not just sharing my vision of the API industry, but also partnering with me to make this event a reality.  I hope all my readers can make it to the event and participate in the discussions about APIs, platforms, mobile, and how we can all work to solve the biggest challenges in the space. &nbsp;This discussion will allow all of us to make significant change across all business sectors and at all levels of government using APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/open.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I set out to put on an API industry event in early 2012, I had grand visions of what it would be.  Getting everyone together to discuss the best ideas, approaches the  industry has to offer--while also discussing the critical topics such as open APIs, developer rights, monetization, etc.</p>
<p>Fast forward 10 months, and the event is a reality, and even though it doesn&rsquo;t exactly look like I imagined, it is damn close--with&nbsp;<a title="lots of amazing API discussions" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sessions.php">lots of amazing API discussions</a>.</p>
<p>After I <a title="API event has 60 speakers" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">announced the event has 60 speakers</a>&nbsp;yesterday,  I saw a tweet from Dave Winer (<a title="@DaveWiner" href="https://twitter.com/davewiner">@davewiner</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 35px;">
<p>A conference about APIs with only speakers representing corporate APIs. Not one open API, so no interop. Lost.<a title="http://0ox.r2.ly/" href="http://t.co/VBmfy5nb">0ox.r2.ly</a></p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Now for those of you who don&rsquo;t read entire posts, I&rsquo;m NOT going after Dave.  We&rsquo;ve already tweeted back and forth and discussed, and he is supportive.  This post is about my feelings and thoughts on "open", and how we can all work together to make sure the industry is as open as possible.</p>
<p>First, I don&rsquo;t see things as black and white.  When it comes to politics, life or the API industry.  To ability to snap our fingers and everything becomes open will not happen.  It will be a lot of hard work and be very painful.</p>
<p>Next, I can honestly say there isn&rsquo;t anyone else in the space who is dedicated to open APIs as much as I am.  Sure Dave is much bigger name and has more history on this, but this is ALL I do.  Period.  I don&rsquo;t work on anything else. It is my day and night job.</p>
<p>I have written constantly about the need for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/04/04/open-building-blocks-for-an-api/">open API building blocks</a>, <a title="open API billing and traffic control" href="/2011/05/21/open-source-api-billing-and-traffic-control/">open API billing and traffic control</a>, all while constantly <a title="what open even means" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/05/30/public-api-vs-open-api/">asking what open even means</a>?  My evangelism has helped guide two of the service providers in the space to deliver the first enterprise grade open source API products, from <a title="WSO2" href="http://wso2.com/products/api-manager/">WSO2</a> and <a title="Alcatel-Lucent" href="http://apigrove.net/">Alcatel-Lucent</a>. &nbsp;While these products aren't everything I want, they are a start.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer in constantly discussing what &ldquo;open&rdquo; means.  Is it free access, write capabilities, TOS, open source software under the hood, distributed technology, embracing open standards or is it just using the word, as many people feel comfortable with.  Through these open and honest conversations, I firmly believe we&rsquo;ll educate people and change their opinions one by one.</p>
<p>This is one of my goals at the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a>.  At first glance it is easy to think the event might appear to be a corporate API lovefest, but let&rsquo;s scratch the surface a little bit:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Steve Klabnik</strong> - His keynote title is &ldquo;Why Open?&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Singly</strong> - I don&rsquo;t know anyone who cares more about open access to personal data than Singly&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - Tony and the gang are building amazing open source tools that facilitate API development</li>
<li><strong>Kirsten Jones</strong> - Kirsten&rsquo;s talk on educating owners and devs about HTTP is critical to the standard being used consistently across industry&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Temboo &amp; Webshell </strong>- These guys entire business rely upon open TOS allowing them to aggregate APIs and their existence provides real pressure for API owners to open up&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Hack Education</strong> - I&rsquo;m biased here.  But there is nobody in education working as tirelessly as my girlfriend Audrey Watters to open up data that is locked in education silos</li>
<li><strong>Donors Choose</strong> - An online charity that provides open data and APIs to make classrooms better&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Seabourne</strong> -  Seabourne has a suite of open source and open API products like Cumula that are transforming the government and making it more open and transparent</li>
<li><strong>Digital Strategy</strong> - I will be showcasing all the open tools, data and API initiatives across federal agencies--spearheaded by the GSA</li>
</ul>
<p>That is 10 out of 60 of the session and keynote speakers bringing open discussions to the table. &nbsp;There are also three panels that are purposefully designed to discuss open:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Building Great APIs: Do&rsquo;s and Don&rsquo;ts&nbsp;</li>
<li>API Business Models&nbsp;</li>
<li>APIs Platforms and Business Model Tradeoffs</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see there will be plenty of "open" discussions at API Strategy &amp; Practice--I&rsquo;m sure I could extract more if I had time.&nbsp;I would love to be able to have a perfectly open API industry and perfectly open API event, where everyone agreed on what open was, widely used open standards and came together to truly make the industry the best it can be.  But it doesn&rsquo;t exist.  We have to create it incrementally.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/index.php"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/api-strategy-home-1.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>API Strategy &amp; Practice took corporate sponsorship to make sure everyone has an event to come to.  Then we got to work bringing together the best minds (yes some corporate running closed APIs), to work together and discuss all the issues across a multitude of industries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 100% dedicated to the concept "open".  I don&rsquo;t work for any corporation, I&rsquo;m 100% independent so that I can have the loudest, most unrestrained voice possible. And I am dedicated&nbsp;to making sure the event is about the community, ideas, strategy and real discussions about the toughest challenges we face in the space.</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t there, participating in these discussions, I&rsquo;m afraid we are losing an important voice, and that is a lost opportunity.  So please contact me if you wish to be there.  I will make sure you get in. &nbsp;Otherwise, you will miss your chance to convince some of the folks who might not see open, in the same way you do.</p>

<p>I finished updating the <a title="speaker linup" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">speaker lineup</a> for the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> this weekend.  While we still have a couple of panels to finalize and keynotes to announce, the speaker lineup is almost final.</p>
<p>We have spent almost 8 weeks reaching out to leaders across the API industry, soliciting submissions for keynotes, panels and sessions.  It has been a lot of fun taking all the submissions and crafting the most compelling schedule as possible.</p>
<p>It was really important to me that we didn&rsquo;t just&nbsp;discuss the common areas of the API industry, like service providers, REST, etc.  Not that these aren&rsquo;t relevant--they are!  But I wanted to make sure we discuss some areas that are critical to the space, but do not get much airtime.  Topics like API design and API life-cycle methodologies.</p>
<p>I feel it is also critical to discuss where we are going, by covering topics like API automation, aggregation and building of programming frameworks on top of numerous APIs--trends that will allow us leap forward in how we consume and build apps on top of APIs.</p>
<p>In the next two weeks I will be going through our lineup in detail and talking about the various API session tracks like music, social, payments, government and education to name a few prominent session areas.</p>
<p><a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/api-strategy-home-1.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>While I started getting excited about this event back in August, it is really starting to get real.  I&rsquo;m really psyched about how this event has come together.  There will only be 250-300 people at the event, so it&rsquo;s going to be a very intimate opportunity for network with these API industry leaders.</p>
<p>Make sure and <a title="register for the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">register for the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> ASAP, and I look forward to seeing you there.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/healthy-developers/Jeremia-Kimelman.jpeg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>As part of my research into how to create <a title="Healthy Developer communities" href="http://kinlane.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=HealthyDevs">healthy developer communities</a>, I've been spending time reaching out to organizers of developer meetups in different cities so I can get some insight into what it takes to successfully organize and run a developer meetup.</p>
<p>I recently spoke to Jeremia Kimelman (<a href="https://twitter.com/jeremiak">@jeremiak</a>)&nbsp;of <a title="Tout" href="http://www.tout.com/">Tout</a>, who runs <a title="Mobile Developer Mondays" href="http://www.meetup.com/momolabs/">Mobile Monday Developers</a>. Jeremia took over the Mobile Monday Developers with the idea that he would create a meet up format where tech companies could reach out to developers in a non-spammy way.  Companies could sponsor workshops and come in to deliver on topics like HTML5 or HTML5 vs Native Apps, and do it in a way that would add value to developers worlds.</p>
<p>This is a model that I'm sure many tech companies would drool over, and very often view meetups as a perfect medium for this type of sales pitch.  As I reach out to meet up organizers I get the vibe that many of them already get solicited by companies in this fashion--either because they don't respond at all, or by being somewhat hostile to my questions about their meetup.</p>
<p><a title="Tout" href="http://www.tout.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/healthy-developers/Tout.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Jeremia was able to grow his meet ups from about 40 to 140 members with this model, but when I asked him if this was a model that could be replicated, he replied, "definitely not".  It doesn't create value. It doesn't solve the problems developers face and ultimately will doom your meetup to failure.</p>
<p>As platform and API owners it's easy to drink our own kool-aid and think what we are offering is what developers want.  Jeremia said it's easy to project your business understanding onto developers, and assume they are concerned with things like monetization and in-app payments, when in reality these things might be the furthest thing from their minds.</p>
<p>In an effort to truly deliver value to developers, Jeremia decided to pivot, working to better understand better how to make it a community owned event. By actually solving the problems developers face, making the event truly about learning and growth--not about what we perceive developers will need, and our products.</p>
<p>Not all developers are created equal.  iPhone developers won't see things the same way as Android devs, and Windows mobile developers are going to have way different needs than others.  "Don't try to be everything to everyone", said Jeremia.</p>

<p>To make it about developers and to introduce community into the meetup he is playing around with letting attendees share the problems they personally face as developers, letting the group openly discuss the problem, provide solutions and help each other learn and grow.  This has the potential to bring value and community to the meetup in an organic way, not something that is imposed by him or a company.</p>
<p>As API or platform evangelists I think it's easy to be self-centered, making hackathons and meet ups all about us. &nbsp;When in reality we should be actively working to just support developers as they are. &nbsp;We need to work with them to understand the problems they face, and help them find solutions--even if the solutions are not our products and services.</p>
<p>In the end, if the developers are successful and we helped them get there.  It will go a long way in building trust, something that can't be established when just evangelizing or selling our company to developers at meetups around the country.</p>
