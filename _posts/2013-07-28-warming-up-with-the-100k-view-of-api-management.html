     This is my first blog post, following a very nice week, offline in Maine. I have purposely setup the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network to be a mesh network of API research project nodes</a>, allowing anyone to to start from ground zero and work their way through the different aspects of the API universe. The dirty little secret, is I set this up to benefit me first, as well as you the reader. After I get back to the world from time off, I'm very disoriented and I need a way to start over and work my way back through all of my projects.
</p>
<p>
     Each time I pick my research up, I need an easy way to work my way through it, refresh my memory, and hopefully constantly realign my view of the API universe, not just after vacations, but on a week to week basis. So this morning I started with the 100K view of <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a>.
</p>
<p>
     When I started API Evangelist, I saw that the technology of APIs was being worked out, leavig the business of APIs as something that needed researching. Now in 2013, I'm seeing the same need emerge around the politics of APIs.

<p>
     This venn diagram is a rough, 100K view of what I consider to reflect the healthy building blocks for any API provider. Depending on each companies or organization's goals, they may give more or less attention to each these building blocks.

     If you are coming from the enterprise you will see much of this as SOA governance, which <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/27/what-is-a-better-word-for-governance-when-it-comes-to-apis/">I have spoken about in the past being the legacy inverse of API management</a>, and will continue to articulate in future stories as I find time.
</p>
<p>
     Now that I'm warmed up with the 100K view of the API space, I'm ready to finish work on my API <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>, <a title="API Discovery" href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a> and <a title="API integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a> white papers I was working on before I left, as well as my weekly API monitoring and analysis.
