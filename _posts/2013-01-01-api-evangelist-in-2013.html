<p><em>After looking back at 2012, I wanted a January 1, 2013 blog post for my blogs.  My first blog post of 2012 was my tour schedule for January, 2012.  While it was a pretty busy time for evangelizing and hackathons, I wanted something a little deeper.  I&rsquo;m not sure what, but I will play with the format year to year, until I find what I&rsquo;m looking for.</em>
<p><em>Every year I rewrite my bio, based upon where I am in my life.  I&rsquo;ve been doing this since 2009.   This year I will write inaugural blog posts along with my bio reworking, and post to each of my active blogs.  We&rsquo;ll see if it resonates again in 12 months, and I do it again in 2014.</em>
