{% include JB/setup %}<p>Google has made another step towards a more common API infrastructure in line with their API Discovery Service, API Explorer, and API Console by launching a single terms of service for all Google APIs.Google has rewritten their terms from the ground up with the goal of making them easier to understand for application developers.At the moment it seems as though most of the APIs that use the central terms of service are content and data related APIs, like Google Tasks, Google Moderator,Â Google Charts and Blogger.While more complex APIs like Youtube, Google Analytics, Google Adwords and Google Latitude still use their own terms of service.Over time, more APIs will be migrated to the new, centralized terms of service format.</p>
