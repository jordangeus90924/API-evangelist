        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/08/18/my-api-talk-at-montgomery-county-java-user-group-in-dc/">My API Talk at Montgomery County Java User Group in DC</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/mcjug-rockville-md/mcjug_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>While out in Washington DC last week I was invited to speak at the <a title="Montgomery County Java Users Group" href="http://www.mcjug.org/">Montgomery County Java User Group</a> in Rockville, MD.  Without much of an understanding of who my audience was I chose to talk about the <a title="Building Blocks of a Successful API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/12/the-building-blocks-of-a-successful-api/">Building Blocks of a Successful API</a>.</p>
<p>There was about 25 developers attending from various companies with a heavy health care influence, since the building that hosted the event was home to several health care technology companies.   There were also developers from firms who contracted with federal agencies ranging from Census to the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised to find out how hungry many of these developers were for information about the API movement and what is working in the open, public API space.  As with my experience with other enterprise companies, these developers were well versed in APIs in the context of service oriented architecture, but had little experience with the building blocks used by many of the successful public APIs operating today.</p>
<p>My presentation went for about an hour, then we discussed not just the business of APIs, but the politics of APIs for another hour.  With the health care presence in the room, the conversation quickly focused on the challenges around deploying APIs in an industry that is so heavily regulated, but also dominated by several 1000 pound gorillas who really have no interest in opening up data, something that threatens their control and dominance.</p>
<p>If I had more money, I think I could spend 100% of my time traveling around the country talking to user groups like MCJUG.  There is a hunger for information about the tech, business and politics of APIs by developers, and I will be coming back soon to Rockville, MD to talk more about APIs with MCJUG. For now I will keep publishing as much content as I can to help these developers understand APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2012</span>
        <p>Continuing my API Craft road show, I landed in Washington DC for the second week in August.  As I planned my trip to the nations capital, I planted the seeds for an API Craft DC version.</p>
<p>I chose a popular H Street watering hole, the <a title="Queen Vic" href="http://www.thequeenvicdc.com/">Queen Vic</a> to host the event, and in tune with <a title="API Craft PDX" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/20/definition-of-api-craft/">API Craft PDX</a> and <a title="API Craft SFO" href="/2012/08/18/api-craft-san-francisco/">API Craft SFO</a> about 10-15 people showed up to drink beer and discuss APIs, DC Style.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-craft/API-Craft-DC-August-2012.jpg" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p>I was impressed with not just the energy for APIs in DC, but the startup buzz occurring in a city, many like to associate with slow moving government bureaucracy.  API Craft DC brought out one API Service Provider <a title="APIphany" href="http://apiphany.com/">APIphany</a>, and an assortment of companies that contract for the government and several other private companies including API geeks from <a title="QVC" href="http://www.qvc.com/">QVC</a>.</p>
<p>API Craft DC has triggered requests for three new gatherings that I will be planning, including API Craft NYC, API Craft Philadelphia and API Craft Atlanta.  Dates coming as soon as I can.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2012</span>
        <p>On the heels of the successful <a title="API Craft OSCON Portland, OR" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/20/definition-of-api-craft/">API Craft meetup in Portland during OSCON</a>, I was landing in San Francisco for a few days and at the request of SFO API folk, quickly organized a meetup at the Chieftain Pub, and thanks to <a title="@abraham" href="https://twitter.com/abraham">@abraham</a> it was a great turnout.</p>
<p>10-15 people showing up seems to be about the normal for these events, and this API craft had a good showing of API Service Providers with 3Scale, Apigee, Mashery and Mashape representing.  Then we had API folks from IFTTT, Pearson and SendGrid.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-craft/API-Craft-SFO-July-2012.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p>It was also great to have out fellow evangelist and unicorn herder, @abraham.  The SFO API Craft meetup was another great gathering in a growing trend within the API community, and I plan on having them in every city that I can, I hope you do too!</p>

<p>When I started API Evangelist two years ago, I noticed some common practices by API owners, in how they tailored their API areas, and I started calling these <a title="API Building Blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">API building blocks</a>.  I started a section of the site dedicated to my building block philosphy and showcased what I felt were the most common building blocks across the most successful APIs.</p>
<p>Two years later, and after having viewed just about every API publicly available, I have updated my <a title="building blocks section" href="/buildingblocks/">building blocks section</a>, based upon the practices of 1500 of the most successful APIs.  Along with this update I have also published a white paper called <a title="The Building Blocks of a Successful API" href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">The Building Blocks of a Successful API</a>.</p>
<p><a title="The Building Blocks of a Successful API" href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">The Building Blocks of a Successful API</a> is not meant to provide detail on implementing these building blocks, but shed light on the common ones used by the top APIs.  The white paper is 32 pages long and provides:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>73 Common API Building Blocks, in 18 Categories</li>
<li>30 Top APIs for Review While Planning Your API</li>
<li>Building Block Checklist for Easy Review Before Launch</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this information is freely available on this site, but will require some clicking to gather across pages and blog posts.  If you can&rsquo;t afford the white paper, I want you to be able to learn what you need to be successful. The Building Blocks of a Successful API is meant to be a single PDF, for you to easily read, and find success in planning your own API.</p>
<p><a title="The Building Blocks of a Successful API" href="https://tinypay.me/~DRCho6h/the-building-blocks-of-a-successful-api-by-kin-lane">The Building Blocks of a Successful API</a> is the first in a series of white papers I&rsquo;m producing to provide the resources needed to successfully plan, deploy and manage your APIs while also producing the revenue I need to keep doing the research and writing the drives <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> and <a title="API Voice" href="http://apivoice.com">API Voice</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support, and I good luck with your API!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/08/08/thirty-apis-to-look-at-when-planning-your-api/">Thirty APIs To Look At When Planning Your API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2012</span>
        <p>When planning an API, I always tell people to go look at as many of the top APIs as they can before crafting their own API strategy.  I'm always surprised how many API owners I talk to don't actually use other APIs.  They can usually reference the main ones like Twitter and Facebook, or the usual rockstar Twilio--but very few can cite 10 or more APIs they like.</p>
<p>Recently I spent some time looking through all of <a title="ProgrammableWeb API Directory" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">ProgrammableWeb's APIs</a>, and I made a list of the 30 APIs I like, and would reference when designing an API strategy.  Since I'm more about the <a title="Business of APIs" href="/business_of_apis.php">Business of APIs</a> and not just the finer, technical points, these I feel are unique because of their business approach to delivering their API.</p>
<p>Here are 30 of the best APIs I think you should look at when planning your own API strategy:</p>

<p>Not all of these APIs do it perfectly, but each of them have something we can learn from when planning, deploying and managing our own APIs. &nbsp;All of these APIs have an active presence, so I recommend reaching out to them and ask questions about what made them successful or follow their blog and Twitter accounts.</p>
<p>If there is an API you feeling strong about that is not on this list, please let me know. &nbsp;Or if you feel one of these APIs doesn't do something right, either technical or otherwise, also let me know as well (except if its Twitter). &nbsp;</p>

<p>I maintain an active list of online services I depend on for my business, in Evernote.  Each month I spend an hour or two maintaining this list, to make sure it is complete and actively change my logins when appropriate.  As a recovering IT guy, and maintaining infrastructure for myself, but also <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a>--so I keep good tabs on the various services I use.</p>
<p>While going through this my services list this month, I added a new section to it, and started tracking if I depend on the service for their API.  I have enough automated jobs running on top of APIs I needed to make sure I keep good track of which APIs I depend on. Here are some of the API I depend on to keep my business operational.</p>
<p>First I depend on a couple of key Google APIs:</p>

<p>I depend on these APIs to run <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, <a title="API Voice" href="http://apivoice.com">API Voice</a> and <a title="The API Stack" href="http://theapistack.com">The API Stack</a> as well as support the other research and consulting that I do.  Some of these services I pay for, some of them I use for free.  Usually if a service sticks around in my world for more than 3 or 4 months I pay for some sort of premium account or access.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I depend on a lot of APIs, partly because this is my game, I&rsquo;m an API Evangelist.  But it is also because APIs provide me with the data and resources I need to operate, and as a programmer I&rsquo;m able to quickly put APIs to use for my business.</p>
<p>Tracking on the APIs I depend will be a regular part of my IT strategy, and I&rsquo;m even going to publish this as a public page on my websites--showcasing what APIs have done for my business.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for extremely simple ways API Evangelists can support their developers without rolling out complex tools or platforms.  The latest approach comes from the <a title="Disqus API" href="http://disqus.com/api/docs/">Disqus API</a>, and how they are using Twitter to answer developer questions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 45px;">
<p>Tweet with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23DisqusFAQ">#<strong>DisqusFAQ</strong></a> to get your frequently asked questions answered by <a href="https://twitter.com/disqus">@<strong>disqus</strong></a>!</p>
&mdash; DISQUS (@disqus) <a href="https://twitter.com/disqus/status/227934056820662272">July 25, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Using a #hashtag is a great way to allow developers to ask questions without learning some new system or complex process.  They can simply Tweet out their question in real-time, in a format they are hopefully already familiar with.</p>
<p>As an API owner, you can quickly help solve a developers problem, allowing them to get back to developing.  Because of the Twitter 140 character format it will help keep their questions brief.  Then using the Twitter REST API, you can easily pull, filter and integrate FAQs for your API into your master FAQ list.</p>
<p>Thanks Disqus for keeping developer support so simple.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/07/29/api-driven-twitter-advertising/">API Driven Twitter Advertising</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Jul 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/advertising/Twitter-Ads.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing around with my <a title="Twitter Advertising" href="https://ads.twitter.com">Twitter Advertising</a> account, trying to understand Twitter&rsquo;s path to monetization.  The Twitter Advertising interface is pretty clean and simple, allowing me to promote my account or tweets in four easy steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - I can choose the locations where I want to reach users anywhere in the world, in specific countries only or in specific US cities:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/advertising/Twitter-Advertising-1.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - I can promote my Twitter account prominently in the who to follow section to users that are most likely to be interested in my account--I only pay for new followers that I gain:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/advertising/Twitter-Advertising-2.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - I can promote my Tweets, prominently displaying them to other users with similar interests:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/advertising/Twitter-Advertising-3.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 </strong>- Then plug in my credit cards to pay for the ad spend I setup for my promoted account or tweets:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/advertising/Twitter-Advertising-4.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p>Twitter Advertising is pretty straightforward.  I wouldn&rsquo;t call it anything revolutionary.  But it is implemented simply, making it work for the masses.  I could see businesses adopting it right alongside Google AdWords.</p>
<p>By itself Twitter Advertising makes sense, but when you step back and look at it in context of the rest what&rsquo;s going on with the Twitter ecosystem, I wonder if they are seeing the big picture.</p>
<p>As a Twitter Advertiser will I be able to:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Use the Twitter API to truly understand the space I&rsquo;m advertising in?  Track on patterns, opportunities and be able to get at the data I need to make my advertising successful?   If I have to pay Gnip or DataSift for my business intelligence, it won&rsquo;t work</li>
<li>Have access to an API that gives me full access to the Twitter advertising resource? Allowing me to programmatically tailor my Twitter Advertising campaign</li>
</ul>
<p>It just seems like to me that Twitter is seriously reducing the potential network effect by not including the Twitter API ecosystem in the Twitter Advertising program.   Developers could help deliver innovation beyond just promoted accounts and tweets, extend the reach of advertising if they had more access to data via the Twitter APIs, optimize advertising campaign effectiveness with more API access as well as automate Twitter advertising with an API directly for the advertising platform.</p>

<p>APIs are about to enter a new phase, one where developers can easily program using multiple APIs at once, and non-developers can easily introduce API automation into both their business and personal worlds. &nbsp;A time where APIs are seen as a valuable resource anyone can quickly put use, not just as a technical interface only the geekiest of us understand.</p>
<p>Web APIs have matured out of its earlier service oriented architecture (SOA) roots, often shedding a rigid SOAP approach to a more flexible RESTful implementation, increased efficiency by opting for more lightweight JSON over bloated XML, and becoming more accessible with API explorers and interactive documentation like <a title="Swagger" href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a>, <a title="Mashery I/O Docs" href="http://www.mashery.com/product/io-docs">Mashery I/O Docs</a>, and <a title="Apigee Console" href="https://apigee.com/console">Apigee&rsquo;s Console</a>.</p>
<p>Now with over <a title="6,000 public APIs available" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/05/22/6000-apis-its-business-its-social-and-its-happening-quickly/">6,000 public APIs available</a>, there is a need to get more efficient about how we work with APIs, and evolve to where we can truly program the web. &nbsp;But to get there, we have to add a new platform layer that can help standardize the authentication, interfaces and resource types available--simplifying how not just developers, but average users can take advantage of APIs.</p>
<p>One approach is targeting developers with new languages, or extensions of existing languages that can be used to program against one or many APIs, as with <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/home">Webshell</a> and <a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com/">Temboo</a>:</p>

<p>Both approaches provide a much needed platform to help make APIs more accessible, where one is still targeting the developer community and the other will allow anyone to take advantage of APIs through special automation tools and connectors.&nbsp;Beyond these programmatic and automation approaches there is a third approach to API usage, currently being defined to support mobile application development. &nbsp;Companies like <a title="Cabana" href="http://www.cabanaapp.com/">Cabana</a> and <a title="Tiggzi" href="http://tiggzi.com/home">Tiggzi</a> are changing the way we build API driven mobile apps:</p>

<p>These GUI mobile application builders allow developers and non-developers to rapidly deploy mobile applications built on top of APIs, providing new ways of abstracting away the complexity of API integration we commonly experience today. &nbsp;This approach to&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/03/rise-of-mobile-backend-as-a-service-mbaas-api-stacks/">API bundling is also being put to use by Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers like Kinvey</a>, who are building in API gateways for common APIs that would be needed by mobile developers--a move we&rsquo;ll see mimicked by other MBaaS providers.</p>
<p>Which of these three approaches reflect the future of the ProgrammableWeb? &nbsp;Will it be an API programming language, an API automation platform, mobile back-end as a service or a blend of them all?</p>
<p>Only time will tell, but no matter which approach get us there, I can see we are getting closer to a truly&nbsp;<a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a>.</p>

<p>Embeddable tools like widgets, gadgets and buttons built on top of an API are nothing new. A healthy embeddable strategy was behind the success of popular platforms like Youtube, Google Maps, Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>Even with this success, embeddable tools often get overlooked by many companies when planning their APIs.   I was recently introduced to <a title="BandPage" href="http://www.bandpage.com/">BandPage</a>, formerly known as RootMusic, who made a name for themselves by building a successful band promotion application within the Facebook ecosystem, and have crafted a very interesting embeddable strategy. To recover from a recent Facebook platform change, BandPage employed a robust embeddable strategy to quickly decouple their business from Facebook, enabling bands to not only deploy on Facebook, but manage music, photos, tour dates across the web.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/bandpage/BandPage-Update-Once-Publish-Everwhere.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p>Driving the embeddable band pages is a robust JavaScript API, which isn&rsquo;t publicly available, but at some point it&rsquo;s something they&rsquo;d like to expose.  Calling BandPage&rsquo;s embeddable tools widgets really doesn&rsquo;t do them justice, they have a seriously crack team of developers who&rsquo;ve built a pretty sophisticated platform. &nbsp;Their approach deserves notice, not just for the embeddable strategy, but the way they were able to use it to quickly recover from the changes they encountered in the Facebook ecosystem.</p>
<p>I think a healthy embeddable strategy is something every API owner should craft. &nbsp;The right set of embeddable tools can extend your reach beyond the average developer community, while also allowing your data and resources to exist on any site or platform.   And in the case of <a title="BandPage" href="http://www.bandpage.com/">BandPage</a> it can also free you from having your wagon hitched to any single platform like Facebook, and open up much wider opportunities for success.</p>

<p>The current API development space is very self-ruled, in that web API developers have freed themselves of earlier SOA attempts to rigidly define and ultimately constricted API growth, into a more grassroots, community-owned approach to RESTful API design.</p>
<p>You can see this happen in real-time on the public Google Group called <a title="API Craft" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/api-craft">API Craft</a>.   API Craft was started by <a title="Apigee" href="http://apigee.com/" target="_blank">Apigee</a>, as an open forum for sharing and developing knowledge and skills around APIs, where you can find the latest throughts, from the smartest people in the space. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoy the online version of <a title="API Craft" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/api-craft">API Craft</a>, and just experienced my first offline version of API Craft at OSCON in Portland this week.  Several API folks got together for beers and API Craft discussion at the White Eagle Saloon creating an awesome real-time, face-to-face extension of the online <a title="API Craft" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/api-craft">API Craft</a> group--an experience I intend to initiate whenever I am in new cities around the country, and I encourage you to do the same.</p>

<p>I think Apigee has really started something important and feeling inspired, I wanted to share my thoughts on a definition of API Craft.  Deriving from the dictionary definition of craft:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Skill in doing or making something, as in the arts; proficiency" and "The membership of such an occupation or trade; guild."</em></blockquote>
<p>I suggest the following definitions of API Craft:</p>
<blockquote><em>"An online forum for sharing and achieving proficiency in the skill and art of web API design, development and management" and "A physical gathering for discussion of the skill and art of web API design, development and management while enjoying a craft beer and good food."</em></blockquote>
<p>Apigee has started something that has taken on a life of its own, becoming a powerful, community driven approach to evolving the skill and art of web API design, development and management--both on and offline.</p>
<p>I encourage you do participate, and I&rsquo;d love to hear your definition of API Craft, as well as more information your local API Craft gatherings. &nbsp;I look forward to seeing you online and in-person at the API craft gatherings.</p>

<p>I was playing with <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a>, a unified social API last night. One of the first things I saw, after landing on the home page, were two choices for signing up as a developer--one with Facebook or the other with my Github account.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing Github as an option for API developer registration, more frequently these days. And it makes sense.  Each of my social networks have a place in my life--Facebook is my more personal social network, Twitter my more public persona, Google is my business platform and Github reflects my developer profile.</p>
<p>When registering for APIs and development centric platforms I&rsquo;d much prefer to keep these associated with <a href="https://github.com/kinlane">my Github profile.</a> And for an API owner it makes sense to have developers linked using Github, because of the social effects and interactions possible with code library repositories and documentation.</p>
<p>With two clicks I was signed up for Singly, using my Github, and I dropped into the dashboard where I was given an option to add my first application and begin integrating.</p>
<p>Developer registration using Github should be standard operating procedure for all APIs. Github is the social network I want APIs to interact with me on, and it is definitely where API owners want to connect with their developers, so they can further interact around code, documentation and all the other geeky goodness Github provides.</p>

<p>Web APIs come in all shapes and sizes.   The differences between API authentication, interfaces and data types can be a big challenge when developers work with multiple social networking APIs like Twitter, Facebook and social media APIs like Instagram and Flickr.</p>
<p>Each API tends to run with their own interpretation of what a RESTful API means, leaving developers left with navigating not only the differences between various APIs, but the changes a single API will make from version to version.</p>
<p>Many industry pundits claim this will become unmanageable.  I think its the nature of the web API space, and we should leave API owners to do what they do best, rather than forcing them to agree on standards. &nbsp;Then how will we bridge these difference?  This is an important opportunity for providers to step in and aggregate critical APIs within specific sectors, and provide a unified interface that developers can depend on.  One example of this in action is <a title="Singly" href="https://www.singly.com/" target="_blank">Singly</a>.</p>
<p>Singly aggregates some of the most important social APIs, simplifying authentication, creating consistent patterns for API endpoints and a unified set of data types to work with across all supported APIs.  Singly pays attention to the differences between APIs and versions, so developers can do what they do best--build social applications, using social data from the platforms their users are already on.</p>
<p>Immediately the pundits will ask, how can they keep up with all the changes?  I respond with how can we not move this industry forward without someone paying attention to it for developers.   I see Singly as a necessary component for the API industry to stabilize and move forward.  Developers needing to integrate with a single API can visit the API directly, while developers who need to integrate across multiple APIs can depend on Singly.</p>
<p>I see opportunities for the Singly model to be applied in other niche areas like location based services, video, restaurants and government to just name a few fast growing API business sectors.   It&rsquo;s clear that <a title="RESTafarians" href="http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/whatisarestafarian/">RESTafarians</a> aren&rsquo;t going to come to an agreement on a single stand, and API owners are busy providing the data and resources they specialize in, so a unified approach like Singly appears to be a healthy path forward for standardizing APIs, creating a more stable interfac for developers.</p>

<p>Next generation payment platform <a title="Dwolla" href="/admin/blog/dwolla.com">Dwolla</a> just revamped the home page of their developer center to speak to the widest audience possible.  When you land at <a title="developers.dwolla.com" href="http://developers.dwolla.com">developers.dwolla.com</a> you are given two options:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="I can code" href="http://developers.dwolla.com/dev">I can code</a></strong> - You know the difference between Java and JavaScript and just want to dive into our API documentation</li>
<li><strong><a title="I don't code" href="http://developers.dwolla.com/bd/why">I don't code</a></strong> - You're a non-technical executive, the master of partnerships and products, and want to know why Dwolla is right for you</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an approach I've been long advocating for, and rarely see in API areas. The best case study I always point out is the <a title="LinkedIn developers area" href="https://developer.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn developers area</a>, who provide buttons, widgets and embeddable tools that non-developers can put to use.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://developers.dwolla.com/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/dwolla/Dwolla-Developer-Area.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>Why do this? Well according to Dwolla, "One of the biggest misunderstandings about API portals is that their purpose is only for developers. That&rsquo;s just not true. Integrations start with a spark of curiosity, &ldquo;Would this work for my company?&rdquo; Technical or not, who asks that question is irrelevant at that point; how it&rsquo;s answered is what determines the outcome."</p>
<p>Dwolla's approach reflects the core philosophy of why I started API Evangelist.  I'm not advocating just to developers about the power of APIs, I'm evangelizing to the business leaders and decision makers about the power of APIs.</p>
<p>While actually integrating with your API might be a technical endeavor, much of the business decision around using your API will most likely be made by a non-developer.  Make sure your API speaks more than just geek, and reaches as wide an audience as possible.</p>

<p><a title="Salesforce" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">Salesforce</a>, <a title="ebay" href="/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">eBay</a> and <a title="Amazon" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a> are all three going strong, making money, treating developers as part of the equation and continue to operate legitimate business via APIs for over a decade now.  These three API pioneers set the stage for the API industry during the first &ldquo;dot com bubble&rdquo; in 2000 and Amazon in 2002, and 10 years later still proving you can become an Internet powerhouse with the help of your API developer ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/ebay/ebay-developer-program-history.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>API skeptics always step up and say they are different, that they have core web products, existing business models, etc. Sure, there are differences, but Salesforce, eBay and Amazon have all managed to achieve success with continued investment in their API ecosystem.  None of these platforms have had to restrict or shed their developers to make ends meet, once the utopian API early days are over.</p>
<p>When I read comments, tweets and other noise from people about what fools developers are for depending on an API, I stop and think about these API pioneers.  Developing a large, healthy API ecosystem is not easy--but when you see your API as an essential part of your core platform, and give it the necessary resources, you can strike the harmonious balance necessary to make APIs work.</p>

<p>According to Garling:</p>
<blockquote><em>"A jury has ruled that Google infringed on Oracle&rsquo;s copyrights in building a new version of the Java platform for its Android mobile operating system, but it was unable to reach a decision on whether this infringement was acceptable under the law."</em></blockquote>
<p><a title="Google quickly moved for a mistrial based upon this incomplete decision" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/05/oracle-google-verdict/">Google quickly moved for a mistrial based upon this incomplete decision</a>, and in a statement to <a title="Wired" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/05/judge-oracle-google/">Wired</a>, Google says:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We appreciate the jury's efforts, and know that fair use and infringement are two sides of the same coin,&rdquo; reads a canned statement from Google sent to Wired. "The core issue is whether the APIs here are copyrightable, and that&rsquo;s for the court to decide. We expect to prevail on this issue and Oracle&rsquo;s other claims".</em></blockquote>
<p>The case is now moving into other areas which include patent infringement, but today&rsquo;s portion is what I&rsquo;m most concerned about, dealing with the API copyright vs. fair use, when Google "mimicked" 37 APIs used by the Java platform while building a new Java engine for Android.  While Java APIs</p>
<p>During this case Judge William Alsup defined copyright by saying:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Copyright protects the "expression of ideas" but not a procedures, processes, systems, methods of operation, concepts, principles, or discoveries."</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not 100% sure where I stand on copyright of APIs, I have a lot more education and contemplation to do on the subject.   My gut reaction is concern.  If you can&rsquo;t mimic an API interface, what will this do for innovation and growth in the API space?</p>

To use these tools and libraries, all you do is change the request endpoint (URI) that the tool or library uses so it points to the Google Cloud Storage URI, and your up and running.</p>
<p>This kind of interoperability is critical to growth and innovation in all areas of the API sector.  What if <a title="AVOS Systems" href="http://www.avos.com/">AVOS Systems</a> (owners of Delicious) decided to file for copyright on the Delicioius API, where would this leave Pinboard?  Or what if Amazon copyrighted the web API for EC2 and S3?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.  I only know enough to be concerned at this point.  There aren&rsquo;t many answers right now.  But to quote Jonathan Schwartz, Sun CEO:</p>
<blockquote><em>"We wanted to build the biggest tent and invite as many people as possible,&rdquo; Schwartz said. &ldquo;You have open APIs and compete on implementations."</em></blockquote>

<p>Acquisition of technology startups by companies is a regular part of business today, providing a way for these companies to get the technology, talent, as well as user and market share they need to be successful. These acquisitions play an important part of API ecosystems, with API owners hoping developers build the next killer feature that users will love, something they can invest in, and developers dream API owners will notice their work and purchase their &ldquo;startup&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Looking back at the acquisitions made by a company can function as a sort of &ldquo;tea leaves&rdquo;, allowing us to interpret the companies motivations, possibly telling us where they are headed and who they might acquire next. As part of my&nbsp;<a title="Twitter research" href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">Twitter research</a>&nbsp;I wanted to look at the acquisitions made by Twitter over its six year history:</p>

<p>Twitter&rsquo;s acquisitions are diverse and appear to be very strategic. Twitter has wisely invested in search, security, messaging and data storage, while also taking control over mobile and desktop clients. &nbsp;Twitter has made some smart acquisitions out of the ecosystem, and you have to wonder why acquisitions of companies like Tweetie and TweeDeck caused such a backlash, while acquisitions like Backtype, Julpan and Dasient you don&rsquo;t hear much of anything from the ecosystem.</p>
<p>I would like to understand other players in the Twitter ecosystem like the firehose partners and investors more, before I draw too many conclusions from the acquisitions Twitter has made. &nbsp;Twitter has already made 6 acuisitions this year, the same amount as Twitter acquired in 2011, and we are only halfway through the year. &nbsp;It makes you&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/03/rumor-twitter-to-acquire-sense-networks-to-target-twitter-ads-locally/">wonder who Twitter's next acquisition will be</a>.</p>

<p>When covering the API space, it is easy to talk about the APIs that are doing it wrong.  When <a title="Twitter gets ready to screw over developrs" href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/delivering-consistent-twitter-experience">Twitter gets ready to screw over developers</a>, Facebook breaks something or Google changes their approach--the blogosphere and twittersphere eats it up.</p>
<p>What is harder, is finding the stories about success in the space.

<p>In response, I always step up with <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>.  Twilio is the poster boy of how to do it right.  They just get it.  Ok, we use Twilio a lot, I admit.  After Twilio I tell people to look at <a title="Stripe" href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>.  Another great example of an API centric company, who elegantly solves a problem with a dead simple, but powerful API.</p>
<p><a title="Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/flickr.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>After Twilio and Stripe.  I try to think about some of my favorite APIs from the past, the social pioneers that helped kick things off--APIs like <a title="Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> and <a title="Delicious" href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a>.  Flickr Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake coined the phrase "<a title="Biz Dev 2.0" href="http://apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">Biz Dev 2.0</a>", which was a driving force behind the <a title="Flickr API" href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr API</a> originally.</p>
<p>Ok, Flickr and Delicious are the past, leaving a little to be desired after acquisitions, but another API from the past that really doesn&rsquo;t get much bad API press is <a title="eBay" href="http://developer.ebay.com/common/api/">eBay</a>.  Have you taken a look at the eBay API ecosystem lately?  They have APIs that are there to help make the API ecosystem more efficient.</p>
<p><a title="Amazon Web Services" href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take it one notch further.  One reason I believe in APIs, is my personal experience deploying mission critical infrastructure with <a title="Amazon Web Services" href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS).  Using AWS I deployed web, mail and database services with Amazon EC2 and delivered content ranging from PDF files to streaming video using Amazon S3.  Using AWS I designed and deployed the architecture behind registration and support technology for SAP North America Events and Google events for two years.  AWS plus mission critical events make the perfect opportunity to prove the value of APIs.</p>
<p>My point is, it can be easy bash Twitter, or any other API but let&rsquo;s try and remember that when an API is successful, you probably won&rsquo;t hear much about it, things just work--that is the nature of APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/twitter-access.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Twitter has become a global communication platform, allowing anyone in the world to express anything, from simple everyday thoughts, to ideas that some say have the potential to be the seeds of revolution.  Twitter&rsquo;s success was made possible because of open access to Twitter via the web and mobile phones via either SMS or native apps--with a large portion of this access made possible via an open Twitter API.</p>
<p>While the Twitter API is still showcased as an important part of the platform, access via the API is certainly not what it used to be.</p>
<p>While most every feature on Twitter.com is accessible via the API, overall access has been diminished through what is known as &ldquo;rate limiting&rdquo;.  Rate limits began in 2007, to help limit the load on Twitter servers by reducing the number of calls anyone can make in an hour. But over 6 years these rate limits morphed into not just hourly limits, but to restricted access to Twitter increasingly valuable data stores--something that is not at all related to server stability.</p>
<h2>Restricting Access</h2>
<p>As the importance and value of the Twitter data grows, API access limits have become an vital tool for Twitter to tame the Twitter API ecosystem. Twitter has also slowly establish 100% control over web and mobile clients, while also setting the stage for the commoditization of Tweets, creating a new ecosystem where only sanctioned firehose partners are allowed to provide API access.</p>
<p>While the Twitter firehose began as a way to provide wider access to developers, and not as a monetization strategy, it has become just that--a way for Twitter to monetize each and every Tweet, leaving access to Twitter data looking something like this:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" width="100%">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>As rate limits have evolved from hourly limits into overall data limitations, access has shifted to firehose partners. Most recently it has been handed to the two sanctioned firehose partners, slowly reducing access to Twitter&rsquo;s API, and its value to developers.</p>
<h2>Selling Access</h2>
<p>In the past, even with hourly rate limits, developers were able to navigate through a Twitter search or a user&rsquo;s timeline and go back in history without limitations.  However over the past 2-3 years, history has been moved out of reach, by limiting the total volume of Tweets for a search, user timeline and other endpoints, clearing way for a new way to commoditize Twitter history:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #ccc;"><strong>Provider</strong></td>
<td style="background-color: #ccc;"><strong>Timeframe</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #ccc;"><strong>Twitter REST API</strong></td>

<td style="background-color: #ccc;"><strong>Twitter Streaming API</strong></td>

<td>Back to January 2010</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #ccc;"><strong>Gnip</strong></td>
<td>30 Days with more historical access coming</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Twitter history is now off limits to developers via the Twitter family of APIs, with control relinquished to only two sanctioned partners, who are able to commoditize access to history only for analysis, not for display--leaving the ability to display of Tweets to Twitter. &nbsp;When it comes to history, Twitter has provided access to the Library of Congress, but two years later they are still trying to find the best way to provide access to the archives, without any news of what they have or how they will share this history with the rest of us.</p>
<h2>Marketing "Open"</h2>
<p>Twitter started as a truly open API, openly accessible by the entire ecosystem, and over the last six years Twitter has actively marketed its API as an open ecosystem, encouraging developers to build. This has allowed Twitter to maintain the historical perception that they are an open API platform. In reality, developers who are building actual businesses around Twitter are not just limited, but actively having their access cut-off--leaving Twitter API access to only hobby level projects. &nbsp;If you are looking to build a business on Twitter you need to use one of the Twitter resellers, which means you will have to spend thousands of dollars a month to get data.</p>
<p>Access to Twitter API has been a topic of discussion since they began rate limiting in 2007, but rate limits were not actively used to control what developers could build until 2010, when Twitter began its quest for monetization.  This quest has involved controlling every Twitter endpoint as well as the brand, something that has historically involved developers.</p>
<h2>Control</h2>
<p>As a API owner I understand Twitter&rsquo;s need to maintain control over their brand and platform, but I feel their approach has severely damaged the entire open API movement. Twitter has actively maintained the legacy image of Twitter as an open API platform, encouraging developers to build, while quietly reducing access, stifling innovation around what is the most important global communication and API platforms in the world--a process which doesn't just destroy their ecosystem, but has damaged developer's taste for building with open APIs.</p>
<p>Analyzing the last six years of Twitter's history, it's very clear that Twitter does not have the respect for the ecosystem that has significantly contributed to the company's success. Beginning in 2010 Twitter saw developers as an obstacle to their goals for extracting value from the passionate user base, and monetizing the increasingly valuable stream of Tweets, that we generate on a daily basis, around the globe. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Twitter wraps itself in the rhetoric of free speech, but has done nothing but restrict the voice of the developer and everyone's access to our Tweets.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Jun 2012</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;m on a roll tonight, writing about <a title="tension between API owners and develoeprs" href="/2012/06/24/tension-between-api-owners-and-consumers/">tension between API owners and consumers</a>.  After some driving around California this week, I&rsquo;ve had time to ponder three recent episodes with <a title="Netflix" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/28/putting-the-changes-to-the-netflix-public-api-in-perspective/">Netflix</a>, <a title="LinkedIn" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/28/lack-of-linkedin-communication-about-pealk-leaves-us-thinking-the-worst/">LinkedIn</a> and <a title="Craigslist" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/28/cmon-craiglist-launch-an-api-already/">Craigslist</a>.  This is my last post tonight, and was inspired by a Tweet from James Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/wattersjames">@wattersjames</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>I thought about his Tweet for the last week and he&rsquo;s right.  While it&rsquo;s easy to run and get our pitchforks in these situations and demonize API owners, or bitch about how much API developers suck, this all is just the beginning of something greater--the API economy.</p>
<p>Trade wars are an active part of our global economy, and with the growth in the number of APIs, the tension between API owners and consumers is only going to grow.  We can&rsquo;t see them as black or white, we will have to evaluate them on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>I think my three posts tonight reflect the potential diversity in issues.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Netflix" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/28/putting-the-changes-to-the-netflix-public-api-in-perspective/">Netflix</a></strong> - The movie industry isn&rsquo;t quite ready for public APIs, other change required first, sorry developers</li>
<li><strong><a title="LinkedIn" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/28/lack-of-linkedin-communication-about-pealk-leaves-us-thinking-the-worst/">LinkedIn</a></strong> - A little communication can go a long ways in how we approach terms of service violations</li>
<li><strong><a title="Craigslist" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/28/cmon-craiglist-launch-an-api-already/">Craigslist</a></strong> - Sometimes the market just demands that you need an API, allowing you to tame scrapers</li>
</ul>
<p>James Watters Tweet definitely made me look at this issues in a different light.  And that is what I love about this space, it is constantly changing, forcing me to constantly reevaluate how I see things and tell stories in the space.  And even before I can finish this post John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) has got me thinking about another angle all three of these stories share:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">kinlane</a> all 3 posts hit on one thing: API use has to drive value for the company providing it not just the consumer. Not the case for these</p>

<p>After looking at over 6000 APIs, the most irritating thing for me when reviewing an API, is when I have to work to figure out what an API does. &nbsp;Many APIs just don't communicate what their API does and articulate the value for developers.</p>
<p>Every API should have a quick introductory paragraph at the top of the first page that clearly defines the API in 250 words or less.   Many APIs have a description, but it often reads like this:</p>
<blockquote><em>The [Insert Company Name Here] API delivers programmatic access to all the features available in the [Insert Company Name Here] web application.  Developers can use the API to build web and mobile applications using the functionality it provides.</em></blockquote>
<p>Ok?  You just told me nothing.  I have no idea what your core web application does, or your API.  The second worse offense I see API owners commit, is they get all RESTful on you:</p>
<blockquote><em>The [Insert Company Name Here] API delivers RESTful access to the features available in the [Insert Company Name Here] web application.  Using the API you can construct URLs and GET or POST information to the API and receive either XML or JSON responses.</em></blockquote>
<p>Ok?  You just told me nothing.  You gave me a brief introduction to REST.  Not very helpful.  Often times I have to go to the parent website to figure out what a company does, before I understand the value of an API.</p>
<p>As an API owner, make sure and provide a quick, concise description of your API and the value it delivers.  Don&rsquo;t assume developers are in your head or understand what your company does.  When writing your description, give it to someone who knows nothing about your company and see if they can figure out what it does.</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have to work to understand what your API does.  Describe the value to me, quickly make me understand how it will help me, so I have the motivation to move past your main page, dive into your documentation and begin integrating.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/knight-dragon-standoff.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a couple of new API ecosystem flare ups in the last week.  one from <a title="LinkedIn" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/06/21/linkedin-shuts-down-headhunting-app-how-open-is-open/">LinkedIn</a> and the other from <a title="Netflix" href="http://goodfil.ms/blog/posts/2012/06/18/netflix-quietly-smothers-3rd-party-app-ecosystem/">Netflix</a>.  I&rsquo;m still working on my thoughts about both of these, but in the meantime I can't help but think about the tension between API owners and their consumers.  This tension doesn&rsquo;t exist in all ecosystems, but seems default by nature in others.</p>
<p>In these flare ups, I can&rsquo;t help but empathize with both sides and see each others perspective:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Owners -</strong> This is my company, our resources and our brand.  I may &ldquo;eat our own dog food&rdquo; to show I share your pain, but I really don&rsquo;t understand the developer perspective because I don&rsquo;t use other people&rsquo;s APIs, let alone depend on them for my business livelihood.  I appreciate the work that&rsquo;s going on within the ecosystem, but I also have to keep my bosses happy and maintain relationships with our partners and vendors.</li>
<li><strong>API Consumers -</strong> It&rsquo;s hard when I can&rsquo;t figure out an API or find the right info that will make it easier for me to on-board.  It&rsquo;s even harder when there is nobody to respond to my questions.  It really frustrates me when I can&rsquo;t get the access I need to be successful, even when I&rsquo;m willing to pay. It&rsquo;s even worse when I spend tens or hundreds of hours on a project or startup idea only to see you build it or even worse cut off my access because you feel threatened by me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both sides of the ecosystem can get along, you see it happen with APIs like Twilio, Stripe and even Amazon Web Services. There will be problems within ecosystem, but not all APIs are looking to screw over developers and not all developers are looking to exploit APIs.</p>
<p>I think in the beginning it can be fairly easy to maintain order in an API area, but as it evolves and the community of consumers grows, it can be difficult to find balance and maintain perfect alignment between the owners and consumers goals.  But I think through the right amount of transparency and communication, both sides can find the right balance.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15p;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/wso2/WSO2-API-Manager-Logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>This is a much quicker follow-up to last week&rsquo;s post, <a title="Where Is The Open Source API Platform" href="/2012/06/11/where-is-the-open-source-api-platform/">Where Is The Open Source API Platform</a>, than I anticipated.  I just finished a demo of <a href="http://wso2.com/products/api-manager">WSO2 API Manager</a>, a completely open-source API management platform.</p>
<p>I got quite a few emails and DM&rsquo;s from folks after that post, and while there are other open-source API offerings like <a title="API Axle" href="http://apiaxle.com/">API Axle</a> and <a title="Cumula" href="http://cumula.org/">Cumula</a> (which I will write about separately), I was looking for a full platform tool, and it appears WSO2 is what I was looking for.</p>
<p>WSO2 API Manager is a simple, easy to understand API platform, but has all the hardened enterprise goodness many of you will be looking for when it comes to security, governance, policy enforcement, etc.</p>
<p>The platform is broken into three main buckets:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<p><img style="padding: 15p;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/wso2/WSO2-API-Manager-Screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<li><strong>API Gateway -</strong> To secure, protect, manage, and scale API calls</li>
<li><strong>API Publisher -</strong> Enables API providers to easily publish their APIs, share documentation, provision API keys, and gather feedback on APIs features, quality and usage</li>
<li><strong>API Store - </strong>Provides a space for consumers to discover APIs functionality, test APIs online, subscribe to APIs, evaluate them and interact with API publishers</li>
</ul>
<p>They break the API users into what I think are important target segments:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Creator -</strong> The technical owner of an API</li>
<li><strong>API Publisher -</strong> The business owner of an API</li>
<li><strong>API Consumer -</strong> The developer or consumer of an API</li>
</ul>
<p>I really like this distinction, because it acknowledges that many APIs are not born out of technical departments, and allows for duel ownership of any API from the technical and business disciplines-- which is very important to the success of an API.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15p;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/wso2/WSO2-API-Manager-Screenshot-3.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></p>
<p>WSO2 API Manager meets my vision because its a platform that has the identity, proxy and other essential technical pieces, but provides an extensible platform to deliver the other building blocks for a successful API like documentation, code samples, how-tos, forums, etc.</p>
<p>WSO2 has a target of end of July for the version 1.0 release, as well as an aggressive roadmap for adding other features for billing, etc.  I&rsquo;m going to download the current version and start playing with to get more familiar with, and hopefully be able to provide a more detailed review of the open-source API management platform.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too early to tell, but WSO2 looks to be the necessary open-source counter balance I was looking for, and the fact that it&rsquo;s already in development shows me that the API space is even more healthier than even I anticipated.</p>

<p><a href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=103">Last May, Pearson Publishing began the roll-out of their new API platform</a>, by doing initial tests using their DK&rsquo;s Eyewitness Travel Guide material, before moving on to a wider range of subjects.  By the <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/08/16/re-inventing-pearson-publishing-using-apis/">end of the summer they had rolled out</a> a total of three APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/eyewitness-guides/apimethod/entries-guide/189/overview" target="_blank">Eyewitness Guides</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/ft-press/apimethod/get-book-block/189/overview" target="_blank">FT Press</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/longman-dictionary/apimethod/get-entry-0/189/overview" target="_blank">Longman Dictionary</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A year later, they now have APIs for the <a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/pearson-kitchen-manager/apimethod/courses/190/overview" target="_blank">Pearson Kitchen Manager</a> and most recently the <a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/nursing-health-survival-guides-api/apimethod/get-article/189/overview" target="_blank">Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guides API</a>.</p>
<p>Pearson is obviously being very cautious with their precious business assets. Taking time to do it right when bundling up these resources and making available for developers via a RESTful interface.</p>
<p>The Pearson Developers community has many of the <a title="essential API building blocks" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">essential API building blocks</a> like documentation, blog, forum, and FAQ. <a title="Registration for Pearson APIs" href="http://developer.pearson.com/user">Registration for Pearson APIs</a> is self-service, allowing me to immediately verify my email, login and begin exploring the APIs.</p>
<p>For support, Pearson provides a contact form while also <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/pearsonapi">maintaing an active presence on Twitter</a>, and even provides a "report a bug" feature for each API. &nbsp;The terms of of use for Pearson APIs is pretty liberal, allowing to me use their content in my commercial applications, even if I use advertising.</p>
<p>Pearson has a done well in opening up their content with APIs.  They&rsquo;ve done it wisely, requiring registration so they can track how its used, but keeping registration self-service and providing sensible terms of use, so they are protected, but also giving developers enough freedom so they can get to building apps and innovating around their content.</p>
<p>It makes sense for Pearson to take it slowly and learn with each API implementation, making sure they do it right.  I think Pearson&rsquo;s simplistic approach to opening up their catalog is a great example for other publishers to follow.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Jun 2012</span>
        <p>Its been over six months since I did my <a title="roundup of 11 API service providers on ProgrammableWeb" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/10/19/api-service-provider-roundup/">roundup of 11 API service providers on ProgrammableWeb</a>. &nbsp;I've been seeing enough new entries into the space, I think its time to do another roundup, providing a single list of API service providers for you to explore.</p>
<p>I will start with I called the grandfathers of the space. &nbsp;The ones who were doing it before APIs became all cool.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.soa.com/atmosphere"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/atmosphere-logo-1.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://www.soa.com/atmosphere">Atmosphere</a></strong>&nbsp;- The SOA Software, Atmosphere&trade; provides a secure, robust platform that companies can use to share their APIs with the developer community of their choice.

</blockquote>
<p>After my post in October of 2011, two other providers came out of the woodwork and said, "Hey! what about us? &nbsp;We've been doing this a while too!" &nbsp;So I have to include them this time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/REST-Web-Services-API-Security/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/intel_logo_500.jpg" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/REST-Web-Services-API-Security/">Intel</a></strong>&nbsp;- Intel&reg; Expressway Service Gateway provides an enforcement point for REST web services messages and can delegate authentication and authorization to identity management and PKI systems such as Active Directory and CA* Siteminder.

Vordel offers out-of-the-box integration with all the leading identity management platforms to provide comprehensive API Security.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there are the three major players in API management, that have been dominating the current landscape:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.3scale.net/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="190" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a></strong>&nbsp;- 3scale provides an Out-of-the-Box Cloud API management Platform &amp; Infrastructure for developers, and companies to securely open, control, manage, operate and monetize their API to 3rd parties (e.g. developers, business partners, etc). 3scale API management platform is Plug and Play, configurable, flexible and scalable and brings API providers an unparalleled level of ownership, control and configuration to ensure QoS, SLA and a great user experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://apigee.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/apigee-logo.gif" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://apigee.com/">Apigee</a></strong>&nbsp;- Apigee provides a range of solutions from entry level tools for exploring APIs with a console and navigating OAuth, to enterprise tools for managing OAuth, Keys and platform for driving developer adoption while understanding usage, managing traffic and scaling an API platform.

</blockquote>
<p>I left one provider out of my last service provider round-up, which is ironic, since the post was on <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a>, which is owned by Alcatel-Lucent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/open-api-platform/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/alcatel-lucent-logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/open-api-platform/">Alcatel-Lucent</a></strong>&nbsp;- The Alcatel-Lucent Open API Platform (OAP) is an API Monetization and Optimization software solution, for Service Providers to turn their data and telecommunication infrastructure into a commercial transaction platform.

</blockquote>
<p>Next there are several companies focused on APIs for your data. &nbsp;Last year I included <a title="InfoChimps" href="http://www.infochimps.com/">InfoChimps</a>, which has pivoted since then and is more a big data platform now. &nbsp;I'm going to go ahead and bundle Socrata in with the remaning data API providers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://kasabi.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/Kasabi-Logo.png" alt="" width="130" align="right" /></a><strong><a href="http://kasabi.com/">Kasabi</a></strong>&nbsp;- Kasabi is a marketplace for people publishing and looking for data.

<p>During the last post I had showcased two new players in the space:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That brings a total of API service providers to 20. &nbsp;There are other providers that deliver services API owners can use, but the companies I've included are focusing specifically on providing services to API owners, and a growing focus on delivering services just for developers.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/webshell-logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm in talks with several other new providers as well, who aren't quite ready at the time of this post. &nbsp;One such company is&nbsp;<a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/home">Webshell</a>, who is developing a scripting language designed for fast API consumption and implementation. After a demo I think Webshell could open up new ways for us to consume, not just single APIs, but many APIs mashed up together creating entirely new API interfaces and interactions.</p>
<p>Any way you look at there is serious API innovation going on in 2012, its an exciting area to be part of. &nbsp;If you know of any API service providers I missed, make sure and drop me a line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had some amazing feedback on my post about&nbsp;<a title="the demand for API and developer evangelists" href="/2012/06/11/the-demand-for-api-and-developer-evangelists/">the demand for API and developer evangelists</a>.  One great perspective was from the team over at <a title="Iron.io" href="http://www.iron.io/">Iron.io</a>, who do cloud messaging, event handling, workers, scheduling and provide a key/value data caching.</p>
<p>Ironi.io&rsquo;s has a unique company philosophy that addresses the need hire an API or developer evangelist.  Their approach is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in an API-driven company everybody is an API and developer evangelist</span>.   Iron.io has their entire team monitoring their public chat, which has lead to everyone in the company understanding customer pain points as well as hearing the praise and positive feedback from the community.</p>
<p><a title="Iron.io" href="http://www.iron.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/ironio/banner-scale-robot.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>While it sounds simple, spreading core philosophies like this company-wide can have a transformative power.  Think of <a title="Amazon&rsquo;s success after Jeff Bezos mandated" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">Amazon&rsquo;s success after Jeff Bezos mandated</a> that, "All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces."</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s the little things that can provide huge shifts in how we think.  A cornerstone of my API Evangelism philosophy is internal evangelism within a company about the power of APIs, in addition to public and partner evangelism.  Iron.io&rsquo;s philosophy changes this for me.</p>
<p>I know that not all companies can make the shift to API-driven companies, but if an entire company can adopt an API-centric frame of mind and share the evangelism role across the company, there is no need for a single API or developer evangelist.</p>
<p>Maybe API evangelist is more of a philosophy than an actual role your company needs to fill?</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/building_blocks.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Every couple weeks I get posts that really strike a chord with my audience, like <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">Barack Obama Directs All Federal Agencies to Have an API</a>, which has received 40K+ page views and 1000+ tweets.  When it comes to sustained traffic numbers, two posts seem to really bring in eyeballs each and every week via organic searches:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="Open Building Blocks for an API" href="/2011/04/04/open-building-blocks-for-an-api/">Open Building Blocks for an API</a></li>
<li><a title="Open Source API Billing and Traffic Control" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/open-source-api-billing-and-traffic-control/">Open Source API Billing and Traffic Control</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These posts are successful, not because of searches driven from a couple of hours on the home page of Reddit or Hacker News, these get page views because users are searching for open source API tools on the open Internet.  Seeing these sustained numbers validates for me the need for an fully open-source set of tools for API deployment and management.</p>
<p>While the top <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/">API management service providers</a> like 3Scale, Apigee, Layer7, Mashery and SOA Software are enjoying growth in API adoption, to <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/06/05/reaching-a-million-apis-and-what-to-do-when-we-get-there/">reach a million APIs and a truly healthy API industry</a>, we need a solid open-source API platform that provides:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>RESTful Framework for Deployment and Management</li>
<li>API Analytics and Metering</li>
<li>API Service and Billing Management</li>
<li>Ecosystem Building Blocks Like Documentation, Code Samples, etc.</li>
<li>Discovery</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Console-1.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></p>
<p>I know there are individual tools that deliver in some of these area, and this is what I am working to bring together via the <a title="API Evangelist Tools" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/apitools/">API Evangelist tools</a> section.  But we need a full suite of tools that API owners can deploy from start to finish, and service providers can benefit from as well as contribute to--something in PHP, Python, Ruby and / or Java.</p>
<p>While looking through thousands of APIs I notice that many of them go silent about 6 months after launch, which tells me many of them spent their resources on development, deployment and initial management--not leaving resources for properly handling the business of their APIs, allowing them to evolve, pivot and find success.</p>
<p>To get the API industry where we need it, we need thousands of more companies jumping in.  Many of these companies won&rsquo;t be able to afford the services of Apigee, Layer7, Mashery and SOA, and with 3Scale and Mashape being the only entry level API management platform(there are others emerging), there is a huge need for an entry-level, open source API offering.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m one of the only vendor neutral players in the space, I&rsquo;d love to solicit some partners to help make this happen.  Even if version 1.0 involves bundling of existing open-source tools, I&rsquo;d like to kickstart a truly open-source movement for the API space.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> &nbsp;Shortly after posting this I was introduced to the new <a title="WSO2 Open Source API Management Platform" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/19/the-100-open-source-api-platform-i-was-looking-for/">WSO2 Open Source API Management Platform</a>.</p>

<p>I just got off the phone with a recruiter of a major API management company, looking to recruit me as a developer evangelist, and last week I talked with two companies looking for developer evangelists.</p>
<p>My profile comes up in a lot of searches on Google, LinkedIn , and with the growing number of APIs, the number of companies looking to fill the role, grows as well. It makes sense that I come up in searches and get a regular stream of calls.</p>
<p>Most recruiters I decline, as I&rsquo;m looking to pay attention to the bigger picture, beyond just a single API--and tell them I will put out a signal to my network, about the role.  I do this knowing, there really is nobody to fill the role.</p>
<p>The recruiter today asked an interesting question.  If you're not available, what type of person should I be looking for?  In my mind, an evangelist should be equal parts:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Engineer</li>
<li>Product Development</li>
<li>Business Development</li>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you can find anyone coming from one of those disciplines, but has the technical chops and isn&rsquo;t afraid of programming-I recommend starting with whichever of those skillsets is most important to you.</p>
<p>Ideally you want to find someone who has been programming for years, but recently has been a lead developer or architect, and has upper management experience as well as understands the business and customer end of operations.</p>
<p>If you fit the profile of an API or developer evangelist, or are just curious about the role, drop me a line I&rsquo;d like to talk more, there is potentially a huge demand out there for your skills.</p>

<p>I have a workflow for dealing with the steady stream of ideas that fly out of my arse on a daily basis.  First, I write them all down in Evernote.  If an idea sticks with me and keeps nagging on me in the back of my mind, I usually give it a place on the internal wiki that I use for managing my world.  Then if an idea sits on the wiki for over a year and I haven&rsquo;t finished building it, and successfully deployed or integrated into my platform--I set it free.</p>
<p>The one year expiration date has come for one of my ideas, and I want to publish here so maybe someone else will run with it.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Project Idea:</strong> RESTGit</li>
<li><strong>Summary:</strong> A RESTful interface for any public or private Github repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>I just want a quick way of throwing up a RESTful front, with or without authentication using <a title="3Scale API management" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale API management</a>. RESTGit would deploy any flavor of language I choose: PHP, Python, Ruby, Java or anything else.</p>
<p>This way I could take select code resources I possess, commit them to a Github repository--then point RESTGit at the repository, and it would generate a REST framework and allow me to customize and adjust as needed.</p>
<p>RESTGit would be open source of course.  It could be deployed as an Amazon EC2 instance, letting me rapidly deliver APIs for any resources I posses and scale as needed using AWS.</p>
<p>I wish I had more time to invest in my side projects, but I&rsquo;d rather see it implemented.  Hopefully one of you readers will find the time to develop RESTGit and open source it for everyone to use.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/06/06/brand-control-within-an-api-ecosystem-twitter-edition/">Brand Control Within An API Ecosystem: Twitter Edition</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">06 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/twitter-bird-blue-on-white.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Right after security, controlling your brand is the biggest concern I get from companies interested in deploying APIs.  They are worried about being able to control their brand and overall message portrayed by their potential developer community.</p>
<p>Branding guidelines and a robust image, button and UI gallery is something I encourage API owners to invest in from day one, because it&rsquo;s easier to set the stage early on than trying to take control after the unicorns are running wild.</p>
<p>One example of this is the darling of the API industry, Twitter.  <a title="Twitter has took further control of their brand today, with the release of #Twitterbird" href="http://blog.twitter.com/2010/10/new-twitter-new-look.html">Twitter has took further control of their brand today, with the release of #Twitterbird</a>.  As Twitter states:</p>
<blockquote><em>Starting today you&rsquo;ll begin to notice a simplified Twitter bird. From now on, this bird will be the universally recognizable symbol of Twitter. (Twitter is the bird, the bird is Twitter.) There&rsquo;s no longer a need for text, bubbled typefaces, or a lowercase &ldquo;t&rdquo; to represent Twitter.</em></blockquote>
<p>The <a title="#TwitterBird" href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23TwitterBird">#TwitterBird</a> is the latest addition to the <a href="https://twitter.com/about/logos">Twitter Trademark and Content Display Policy</a>, where Twitter lays down the following branding guidelines for the Twitter ecosystem:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Assortment of Twitter approved images</li>
<li>Dos and Don'ts of using Twitter images</li>
<li>How to use buttons to promote your Twitter account</li>
<li>Use of Twitter brand in advertising and marketing materials</li>
<li>Use of Twitter brand in merchandise and manufactured items</li>
<li>Naming your applications, products and domains</li>
<li>How to visually design your website</li>
<li>What to do when your writing a book or publication about Twitter</li>
<li>How to display Tweets and other Twitter content</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/Twitter-Branding-Old-1.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come a long ways from <a title="2008" href="http://www.twitip.com/181-twitter-buttons-badges-widget-and-counters-to-help-you-find-followers/">2008</a> and <a title="2009" href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/100-remarkably-beautiful-twitter-icons-and-buttons/">2009</a> where logos, buttons, badges and other Twitter branding items were yet another area where Twitter depended on the Twitter ecosystem for support.  The Twitter community created a wild assortment of assets to be used when integrating Twitter into your site or application.</p>
<p>Then <a title="starting in 2010 Twitter started pulling in the reigns and took more control of their brand" href="http://blog.twitter.com/2010/10/new-twitter-new-look.html">starting in 2010 Twitter started pulling in the reigns and took more control of their brand</a> with the release of a set of &ldquo;refreshed...logos, buttons and widgets to bring the improved look and experience of the new Twitter to your website or blog&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Over the next two years Twitter has continued to polish their brand, while also tightening the rules of how you can use Twitter and Tweets in your own sites and applications.   While I totally understand Twitter&rsquo;s need to get more control, my only criticism are:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/Twitter-Branding-Old-2-2.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Four Years Late</strong> - They should have done this a long time ago.  It took four years before they started doing anything in branding.</li>
<li><strong>Developers</strong> - They should have included the ecosystem in more of the planning as well as creating a layer that includes ecosystem apps in the equation</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for me to sit here in the future, telling Twitter what they should have done, when they were the pioneering API company.  But I feel pretty strongly that many of the decisions in the last two years to gain control of their ecosystem, would have been better off started from the beginning, and also suffers from a severe shortage of ecosystem involvement.</p>
<p>While I can&rsquo;t change Twitter&rsquo;s approach to the Business of their APIs, I can help influence the next generation of APIs.  Make sure you consider a healthy and complete branding resource center for your API, and consider how you can protect your brand while also empowering your developer ecosystem.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/iContact/icontact-logo.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I look at a lot of APIs, the first page you land on makes a big impression, and I can always tell when someone cares enough about developers to craft a simple, quality API Area landing page.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about <a title="what it takes to qualify for the API stack" href="/2012/03/15/qualifying-for-the-api-stack/">what it takes to qualify for my API stack</a>, and today&rsquo;s winner for simply and elegantly qualifying for the API stack is <a title="iContact" href="http://developer.icontact.com/">iContact</a>.</p>
<p><a title="iContact Developers Area" href="http://developer.icontact.com/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/iContact/iContact-Developer-Portal.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Upon landing on the iContact Developers Area main page I visually see what I need to get going:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Get Started</li>
<li>Self-Service Registration</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Code Samples</li>
<li>Resources</li>
<li>Blog</li>
</ul>
<p>Then in the footer you can immediately connect with other areas of the company:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Legal</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a title="iContact Developers Area" href="http://developer.icontact.com/">iContact Developers Area</a> landing page is well crafted and as a developer, makes you feel like someone considered you while designing.  You can quickly get at what you need to start integrating and you feel like someone is there to support you as well as keep the API up and running.</p>
<p>What impression does your API area landing page say about your API?</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/06/03/rise-of-mobile-backend-as-a-service-mbaas-api-stacks/">Rise of Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) API Stacks</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">03 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.kinvey.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mobile-backend-as-a-service/kinvey/kinvey-logo-300.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Mobile is fueling a lot of API growth right now.   Or is it APIs fueling a lot of Mobile growth right now?  Either way, APIs and Mobile go together like chocolate and peanut butter (or Nutella as my girlfriend would say).</p>
<p>With this growth in mobile, we are seeing a rise of Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers, delivering a basic stack of storage, messaging, notifications, user management and other essential components for mobile developers.</p>
<p>The goal of MBaaS providers is to make it very easy for developers to setup and operate a backend for any application.  After delivering the essentials like storage, messaging access, push notifications, etc., it makes sense that now developers will need easier integration with the data and resources available in web APIs.</p>
<p>MBaaS provider <a title="Kinvey" href="http://www.kinvey.com/">Kinvey</a> is doing just that.  Using <a title="ql.io" href="http://www.ebaytechblog.com/2011/11/30/announcing-ql-io/">ql.io</a>, a declarative, evented, data-retrieval and aggregation gateway for HTTP APIs, they are bringing web APIs to developers, like GeoPlaces data using Google Places, product data from Ebay&rsquo;s Product API and social data using Twitter.</p>
<p><a href="http://ql.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-tools/qlio-logo-300.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Kinvey is baking in the most popular and valuable web APIs right into the Kinvey SDK, making data from APIs as easy to access, as data in your local Kinvey data store.  Kinvey will deliver an abstracted layer on top of each API, storing data into tables, making them accessible using common queries like SELECT, FROM and WHERE.  They will even let you do JOINS on multiple data sources, allowing you to mashup and improve API data performance.</p>
<p>Kinvey will take on the heavy lifting associated with the differences between APIs and maintain access between different API versions.  I&rsquo;m assuming with the amount of work involved, Kinvey will be only delivering the most valuable of web APIs or at least the most stable.</p>
<p>Sounds like API owners need to start building relationships with Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers, as this might be the doorway to the next round of growth in your API adoption.  Especially if MBaaS providers can truly make APIs a more local, native experience for mobile developers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><a title="Federal Agency API Deployment Tracker" href="/federal_government.php"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/federal-government/Track-Federal-Agency-API.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited about <a title="Barack Obama directing all federal agencies to have an API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">Barack Obama directing all federal agencies to have an API</a>.   The President has given federal agencies 90 days to create a page on its website, located at www.[agency].gov/digitalstrategy, to publicly report progress in meeting the requirements of the Strategy in a machine-readable format, and implement the requirements of the Strategy within 12 months.</p>
<p>As I said in my post, I wanted to setup a <a title="page to monitor this activity" href="/federal_government.php">page to monitor this activity</a>.  I found a <a href="https://explore.data.gov/Federal-Government-Finances-and-Employment/Federal-Executive-Branch-Internet-Domains/k9h8-e98h">dataset of federal executive branch Internet domains</a>, thanks to Anthony Sutardja, one of my readers. In the dataset there are 1467 domains, with 106 distinct agencies running those domains.  The President states "executive department and agencies" in his directive. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t imagine we are going to see digital strategies in 90 days for all 1467 domains?  I&rsquo;m assuming it will occur within the top level agencies first.  But I&rsquo;m very curious see which agency domains follow, so I&rsquo;m going to leave all of them up.</p>
<p>I created a script that will poll www.[agency].gov/digitalstrategy for each agency.  I will run this every night this year.  The script checks the HTTP status code for the page, records it with a time stamp, and the we&rsquo;ll see who returns HTTP status code 200(OK) first.  Quick note:  It&rsquo;s interesting to see which agency doesn&rsquo;t properly use status codes, but that is another issue.</p>
<p>Anyone want to wager on who is first, and how many of the 1467 meet the requirements for posting their strategy and ultimately implementing APIs?  Personally I&rsquo;m hoping for CIA and the NSF.  Think of the mashups you could make!!!</p>
<p>I all seriousness, this is extremely important.  If agencies meet these requirements, we can see a radically different federal government in the coming years.  As one of my readers and friend said on the post yesterday, "It looks like the Jeff Bezos mandate that he did 10 years ago!". If you don&rsquo;t known what I&rsquo;m talking about, read "<a title="The Secret to Amazons Success, APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">The Secret to Amazons Success Internal APIs</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You can visit the <a title="Federal Agency API Deployment Tracker" href="/federal_government.php">Federal Agency API Deployment Tracker</a> page for more detail, I will keep the link prominent in the right hand feature area of this site, for the rest of the year.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/federal-government/Building-a-21st-century-platform-to-better-serve-the-american-people-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I wanted to publish some thoughts, on what Federal Agencies responding to the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-02/pdf/2011-10732.pdf">Executive Order 13571</a> issued on April 27, 2011, and the White House CIO&rsquo;s, "<a title="Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People</a>" strategy should be considering.</p>
<p>These thoughts are in the business and marketing aspects web API deployment, with light thoughts in the technical areas.  My speciality is not with technical deployment of APIs, I recommend agency leaders visit <a title="API-Craft" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/api-craft">API-Craft</a>, an industry forum with some seriously smart API industry leaders discussing the finer, technical points of web API deployment.</p>
<p>Where I would like to share some thoughts is in the business of deploying and managing Federal Agency APIs.  Insights evolved over 20+ years in the technology field, but exclusively spending the last 2 years studying the business of popular APIs like Twitter and Facebook, and larger API providers like Google and Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sharing my thoughts, not to benefit any company, but because I strongly believe in the transformative powers of Web APIs.   Web APIs have the power to change the way our Government operates both internally, and with the public.  Barack Obama&rsquo;s mandate, &ldquo;requiring agencies to establish central online resources for outside developers and to adopt new standards for making applicable Government information open and machine-readable by default&rdquo;, marks an important point in history.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t screw this up!</p>
<p>While much of the discussion around this announcement on <a title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.apievangelist.com%2F2012%2F06%2F01%2Fbarak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api%2F">Twitter</a>, <a title="Reddit" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ughx0/barack_obama_directs_all_federal_agencies_to_have/">Reddit</a> and <a title="Hacker News" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4056310">Hacker News</a> is positive, there is a lot of skepticism around whether the government can succeed.  With this post, I wanted to share some thoughts on the essential building blocks we&rsquo;ll need to make this work.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Building Blocks<br /></strong>I will only speak lightly on essential technical building blocks that need go into Federal Agencies Web APIs, but there are a couple I consider essential:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Access</strong> - Idenitying proper access levels for web APIs, leaving open when possible, requiring keys when needed and implementing oAuth when it makes sense give users control over which applications access their data</li>
<li><strong>REST</strong> - The dominant approach to deploying web APIs, building on top of the existing structure of the World Wide Web.  REST has proven to robust enough for most any web API while keeping it simple and intuitive for access by a  wide audience</li>
<li><strong>JSON</strong> - I&rsquo;m not advocating for getting rid of XML, but JSON is the accepted standard for API communication.  JSON needs to be adopted as the default for federal agency web APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>There are plenty of other technical considerations, but I&rsquo;ll leave that for other experts to deliver on. &nbsp;Next lets get users, onboarded and using each agencies APis.</p>
<p><strong>User Onboarding<br /></strong>There are a lot of challenges for the average web API developer faces when trying to integrate, initial onboarding has to be quick and painless.  There are a couple of essential building blocks that assists in user onboarding:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Landing Page </strong>- A single landing page for everyone to access federal agency APIs, providing single click access to everything you need to get up and running with the API</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service </strong>- API access needs to be self-service, enabling anyone to discover and integrate 24 / 7 without assistance from any agency staff</li>
<li><strong>Account Management - </strong>Allow users to quickly register using common single sign-on using my Twitter, Facebook or Google accounts, and provide users with easy to understand account, key, application and API usage management tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Next for a developer to successfully go from onboarding to, API integration, it will require an essential set of resource building blocks providing everything they need to understand the API interface, and begin using:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Authentication </strong>- Give users a quick introduction to API access including which endpoints are open, keyed or require oAuth for usage.  Also provide links to support technical information about authentication</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Provide simple, complete and up to date documentation for every Web API endpoint. &nbsp;Also consider deploying interactive, smart documention using a technology like Swagger</li>
<li><strong>Code Samples</strong> - Provide sample code for each API endpoint in all the common languages including PHP, Python, Ruby, .NET, Perl, Java, Objective-C, all provided as Github repositories</li>
<li><strong>Starter Kits -</strong> Provide as many ready to code sample applications and starter kits to show developers what is possible, all provided as Github repositories</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - Provide mobile specific code samples, SDKs and other resources supporting mobile specific development</li>
</ul>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve provided the essential technical, onboarding and resource building blocks, you need to make sure your your agencies API area has the necessary communication building blocks, allowing you to effectively communicate with users about your API, but also give your users a voice in API operations:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - A blog is an essential communication tool in API ecosystems.  Make sure the blog is active, and provides an RSS feed</li>
<li><strong>Forum</strong> - A forum will provide a platform for you to communicate back and forth with API users, providing a rich knowledge for future users, and also opening up the possibility of users helping other users</li>
<li><strong>FAQ</strong> - Provide a simple, realistic and complete list of the most frequently asked questions.  Also keep it a living list, truly reflecting which questions get asked every month</li>
<li><strong>Contact</strong> - Establish some way users can directly contact the agency for support</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - An active Twitter account is a required communication tool</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> - A presence on the top business social network is important</li>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> - An active page on Facebook helps with communication</li>
<li><strong>Google+</strong> - Google's social network can help with developer interaction</li>
</ul>
<p>With proper communication building blocks in place, next make sure and address the legal considerations around the web API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Terms of Use </strong>- Clearly let users know what is expected when they access the agencies web APIs</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Establish clear privacy policies for all people and companies involved</li>
<li><strong>Licensing</strong> - Provide data, API interface and code licensing for everyone to see</li>
</ul>
<p>With legal expectations set, make sure and think about branding for the agency.  While these web APIs are the federal government, for them to be successful, the word needs to get out that our government does such a find job making data available.  There are some common API branding building blocks emerging to accomplish this:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Branding Requirements</strong> - Establish a base understanding of how to properly attribute the agency in compliance with overall usage requirements</li>
<li><strong>Logo</strong> - Provide a single place to find a selection of approved graphical logos and HTML or JavaScript code snippets users can use when adhering to branding requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>After baking in some user implemented marketing for the agency, with API branding, make sure and provide some operational building blocks that help API users understand what is going on with the agencies APIs and where they are going:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Roadmap</strong> - Give users a clear roadmap of where the agency is going with it&rsquo;s digital strategy, providing insight as far in the future as possible</li>
<li><strong>Changelog</strong> - Provide a real-time list of changes made to the API and its supporting building blocks</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing real-time communication on your API operations is important to establishing trust with developers.  If you just make it part of your daily operations, it isn't that much more work.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Developers</strong><br />While planning the digital strategy for your agencies web API make sure and consider non-developers.  One reason for the success of web APIs is that it uses REST, which uses the technology driving the existing World Wide Web, making RESTful APIs potentially familiar to non-developers.  With the right building blocks, web APIs become accessible to a wide variety of users:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong> - Buttons, widgets and badges that are provided on top of a web API provide a copy and paste method for non-developers to quicky make use of the data and information available via an API</li>
<li><strong>Media</strong> - Provide a section dedicated to media, helping media on two fronts 1) to understand what an API does in plain english 2)  to put a web API to potential use in their data journalism efforts</li>
<li><strong>Educational</strong> - Provide information and resources that facilitates API usage by any level of academic research and projects</li>
<li><strong>Platforms&nbsp;</strong> - With introduction of Google Docs, Google Big Query and other big data processing solutions, the opportunity for API integration on these platforms is growing.  Provide templates for using agency APIs within these platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything suggested up until now, truly supports a digital approach, to each agencies digital strategy, but in these environments, the need for face to face and human interaction can be critical to building understanding, awareness and ultimatley a community around a web API.</p>
<p><strong>Events</strong><br />Events are a great way to build awareness around an API, there are several common event building blocks that are used in the industry:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Annual Conference</strong> - Establish an annual event where each API stake holder and any user can rub elbows and share their thoughts about web APIs</li>
<li><strong>Road Show -</strong> Develop a road show that goes from city-to-city, providing a town hall format for understanding each agencies digital strategy</li>
<li><strong>Meetups</strong> - Attend existing developer meetups and gathers that are already occuring in cities around the country</li>
<li><strong>Hackathons</strong> - Sponsors, attend and put on hackathons that encourage hacking around federal agency APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that represents my thoughts on the essential API building blocks federal agencies should consider while formulating their digital strategy.  The only other area I would offer more details on, is around API evangelism and developer advocacy.  Who will be in charge of getting the word out about an API?  Will this be a single person or shared responsibility?  An API Evanglism strategy is critical to the success of an API, but I think I will cover that in another post.</p>
<p>Scrolling back up the page, this seems like a lot, and potentially counter to my wishes that we start simple and make sure this is a success.  My goal with these thoughts is to provide a potential business framework that could be adopted across all agency deployments.</p>
<p>These building blocks are derived from reviewing the API operations of hundreds of existing public APIs, including industry heavyweights like Google and Amazon.   While some APIs like Twitter deal with API management at massive scale, Google and Amazon provide models for managing large numbers of web APIs.</p>
<p>Make sure and spend some time and look at how Google or Amazon is organizing their developer community. &nbsp;If any developer could go to any of the over 100 agencies, or the over 1000 domains, and find a consistent experience shared across <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span></strong> agency web API areas, like they do at Google or Amazon APIs, the chances for success of this iniative is much greater.</p>
<p>I hope someone in one of the agencies reads this, and understands the importance of this moment, and that an API is more than just a CSV or XML dump at a web address.  That, with the right business approach to deploying and managing we can truly transform how government interacts both internally, inter-agency and with the public.  Opening up the federal government to a whole new era of democratic participation, government transparency and interoperability.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Jun 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/gnip/gnip-logo.jpg" alt="" width="160" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing some big data work.  Ok it isn&rsquo;t really, but feels like I should use that label.   What I&rsquo;m actually doing is analyzing the Twitter activity of top APIs.</p>
<p>I have the twitter handles of 100 of the popular web APIs.  I have been pulling and analyzing the Tweets from each of these accounts via the Twitter API for some time now.</p>
<p>It is time that I scale this to about 500 API twitter accounts, and also start monitoring mentions of each of these APIs on Twitte, while also performing searches for some keywords associated with each API or a group of APIs.</p>
<p>At this stage of growth, it was clear I was outgrowing the regular Twitter API and since what I&rsquo;m doing is more big data, than twitter client app, I am looking at the two approved Twitter resellers <a title="Gnip" href="http://gnip.com/">Gnip</a> and <a title="Datasift" href="http://datasift.com/">Datasift</a>.</p>
<p>First I went to Gnip,  looked at their product and it looked like what I needed.  I saw at the bottom of the page, &ldquo;Get Started&rdquo;.  I recognize that language, clicked on it and filled out their form and I get a &ldquo;Thank You, Someone Will Be In Touch&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/datasift/datasift-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>Ok...so I move on to Datasift.  I look at their product and it too, looks like what I need.  I see on the page, &ldquo;Get Started&rdquo;.  I recognize that language, clicked on it, logged on with Twitter, added my email and password, and boom--I&rsquo;m dropped into a dashboard.  I am able to build streams from Twitter using different keywords, Twitter users, etc.  I get freemium access, with the ability to put in my credit card and be billed for more.</p>
<p>Next, I got a quick email from a nice fellow at Gnip asking what I was looking to do, and if I had time in the next couple days to talk on the phone. &nbsp;I will definitely talk with them, but by the time I get on the phone with them I will be 2-3 days into developing my solution around Datasift.  Unless Gnip has some secret pricing or some magic features Datasift doesn&rsquo;t have, I probably won&rsquo;t switch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the difference between self service and sales oriented web APIs.  Which one are you?</p>

Many of these APIs are setup to pull data, enabling developers to use it in their applications for free or paid, with the understanding they&rsquo;ll properly attribute the source.</p>
<p>Many of these APIs like Amazon E-Commerce, eBay, Google Places and Foursquare are engineered to publicly extend the central platform, all feeding back back to the &ldquo;mother ship&rdquo;, either through linking or other type of attribution.</p>
<p>As the Internet evolves, and the era of "big data" takes hold, and as the need for processing data and deriving meaning out of the flood of data available to us online grows--so does the demand for API access that isn&rsquo;t marketing centric.</p>
<p>As a big data developer I may be comparing product pricing from Amazon to auctions on eBay, and I may need to use Google Places data to identify best places to sell my products, and Foursquare to identify local demand.  The needs of big data API developers are going to be radically different than maybe your originally intended developer audience.</p>
<p>Hopefully you are already carefully targeting your developers and grouping them by their usage patterns.  Have you identified any users that are actively using your APIs, but not necessarily following regular patterns? &nbsp;Have you reached out to them?</p>
<p>It might be the case that your API won&rsquo;t be of interest to big data developers or quite possibly that this isn&rsquo;t a market you're interested in.  However it is a question every API owner should ask--<span style="text-decoration: underline;">is my API big data ready</span>?</p>

<p>Ok, can I call 2012, the year of the API now?  Of course this announcement makes me extremely excited!  This is something I didn't think I'd see in the next 5 years, but of course I'm super skeptical too.  Is this something that these agencies are capable of?  Is there enough political will to make happen?  I sure hope so.</p>
<p>I've seen some <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/05/open-government-reboot-focuses-on-apis-instead-of-data/">good coverage of this news on popular tech blogs</a>, but we'll have to wait 90 days and see ho many agencies have publicly reported on "progress in meeting the requirements of the Strategy in a machine-readable format", and ultimately how much momentum this actually gets--or if it gets forgotten.</p>
<p>As soon as I can find an API with all government agencies and their websites, I will make a monitoring dashboard showing how many agencies have published anything, and what it contains, and report on my findings in 90 days.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>&nbsp;I added the tracking page I talked about above, I will be checking the availability of a digital strategy at each government agency website on a daily basis, and posting the status on my <a title="Federal Agency API Tracking" href="/federal_government.php">Federal Agency API Tracking</a> Page.</p>

        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/teapot-steaming.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>In my effort to better understand API access, I&rsquo;m studying how API owners control access to their APIs, with most recently being around Rate Limiting. The other day I asked,&nbsp;<a title="why do we limit API access for developers" href="/2012/05/29/why-do-we-limit-api-access-for-developers/">why do we limit API access for developers</a>, and even&nbsp;<a title="explored rewarding developers for heavy usage" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/01/should-we-be-limiting-developers-api-usage/">explored rewarding developers for heavy usage</a>.</p>
<p>As I continue to understand the impact of rate limits on developers it&rsquo;s becoming clearer that for an API to successfully impose rate limits, you should also be offering rate limit release valves in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Increase Request Form</strong>&nbsp;- There should be a formal, self-service way to request rate limits either for valid uses that you hadn&rsquo;t considered bumping up against rate limit ceiling, or quite possibly for non-commercial purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Utility Pricing</strong>&nbsp;- Providing a pay as you go model, where users meet the "courtesy limit", they can put in their credit card and pay for what they use above and beyond the default rate limit.</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="API Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Console-Rate-Limits.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are many points of friction for developers trying to integrate with an API. In my research, one of the ongoing complaints of developers regarding an API is around rate limits. Many of these complaints are directed at APIs who impose rate limits without any clear path beyond the default limits.</p>
<p>Google seems to be offering opportunities for developers to pay for use beyond their "courtesy limits", providing a form of release valve for developers concerns about API rate limits. &nbsp;Google is providing these release valves for API services via their&nbsp;<a title="API Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/">API Console</a>, but only appear to available for a handful of services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m still unsure about API rate limits in general, it seems clear that if you are going to limit, make sure and provide a release valve in some way, so developers understand what the options are when they hit the ceiling, and that there are opportunities to grow.</p>

<p>I talk with a lot of entrepreneurs in my travels to conferences, hackathons and online with my API evangelism. I get a lot of ideas pitched to me, asking me for feedback, and ultimately if I think their startup is viable.</p>
<p>I hear a lot of good ones, and bad ones. Even the good ones face an uphill battle to get noticed in an extremely crowded and noisy landscape. The one piece of advice I leave with all startups about how to get their web or mobile app noticed?</p>
<p><strong>Develop an API!!</strong></p>
<p>The one thing an API can do for your startup is allow your product to become a feature in other platforms. If you deliver only as a mobile or web app, you are leaving out numerous opportunities to become the next killer Facebook or Salesforce feature, or something smaller like a Wordpress add-on, but ultimately something that could make enough of a mark, that your startup could survive.</p>
<p>So when you are planning the feature list for your killer startup, make sure you consider an API, and the potential of becoming the next killer feature in an existing platform.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-affiliate-network.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>In my quest to understand the monetization opportunities via APIs, I&rsquo;m studying the possibilites around tracking, and now monetization of content and URL&rsquo;s served up via APIs.</p>
<p>The other day I considered <a title="wrapping URLs for another layer of metrics in your API" href="/2012/05/26/wrapping-content-urls-for-another-layer-of-metrics-in-your-api/">wrapping URLs for another layer of metrics in your API</a>, and today I&rsquo;m thinking about how to evolve API monetization beyond advertising, defining entirely new API driven conversion events where both API owners and consumers, can realistically make money.</p>
<p>I first talked about an <a title="advertising network dedicated to APIs and developers" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/09/28/advertising-network-dedicated-to-apis-and-developers/">advertising network dedicated to APIs and developers</a> last year, and everytime I come back to it in my Evernote list, I can&rsquo;t help but consider using the <a title="Google Affiliate Network" href="http://www.google.com/ads/affiliatenetwork/">Google Affiliate Network</a> as an engine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any access to Google Affiliate Network (I submitted request), so all of this is speculative.  But after looking through the <a href="https://developers.google.com/affiliate-network/">Google Afffiliate Network API interface</a>, it looks like I can pull both advertisers, publishers and events through the API-- so I&rsquo;m envisioning two scenarios:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Owners</strong> - As an API owner I could use the Google Affiliate network to define &ldquo;events&rdquo; that could occur via my APIs, and setup my API developers as &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>API Consumers</strong> - As an API consumer I could setup various APIs I use as &ldquo;advertisers&rdquo;, creating specific events for these APIs, and setup my own applications or sites as &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-url-shortener.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>In either case, API owners or API consumers could replace any URLs in content or URLs directly served up via APIs with a Google Affiliate Network generated URL with specific conversion events defined, then shortened using <a title="Google URL Shortener API" href="https://developers.google.com/url-shortener/">Google URL Shortener API</a>.</p>
<p>This would create a layer of not just metrics, but conversion events that could be monetized.  API consumers could choose from affiliate opportunities available on the Google Affiliate Network, and API owners could do the same, or define their own conversion events that were meaningful to their business goals.</p>
<p>These are just some original thoughts on API monetization using <a href="https://developers.google.com/affiliate-network/">Google Afffiliate Network API</a> and the <a title="Google URL Shortener API" href="https://developers.google.com/url-shortener/">Google URL Shortener API</a>.  Seems like there is a lot of opportunity monetize the data and resources flowing through API pipes, whether you&rsquo;re an API owner or avid API consumer.</p>

<p>Nice move!  The Fancy is definitely an easier and cleaner looking site than  Pinterest, and with a monetization move, The Fancy could gain even more market share against Pinterest.</p>
<p>Now if The Fancy wanted to seal the deal and put a death nail in Pinterest's coffin, they should launch an API, and make The Fancy a platform.  Don't just open up API access to your content--open up API access to your new commerce layer as well.</p>
<p>Once you have this mapped out, deploy a well crafted suite of embeddable objects, like share and buy buttons, along with essential widgets--all with the commerce layer built in.</p>

<p>I recently stumbled across the <a title="University of Washingtons Web Services Area" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2012/05/29/university-information-access-with-apis/">University of Washington&rsquo;s Web Services area</a>, where they are working to create a single place to learn about, discover and connect with various APIs that are available at the University.</p>
<p>As the home page says:</p>
<blockquote><em>Web Services at the University of Washington is a method of getting important institutional data from and/or into your applications. Web Services are a way for applications or systems to talk to one another and does not usually involve human interaction.</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m always trying to understand where the next wave of API growth might come from, and while the enterprise is definintely sitting on a treasure chest of information and resources, just waiting to be exposed via APIs--I think Universities might be in the same position.</p>
<p>As soon as Universities start realizing how many APIs they have laying around already, and understand the potential of launching new ones, they are going to have a massive API management problem.</p>
<p>I stumbled across UW APIs via a <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> update of 7 web services from the University.  I started looking around further, and discovered there were 29 total APIs available at UW Web Services.  I&rsquo;m not sure why only 7 are listed at PW, but right there you start seeing slippage in the current API directory model.</p>
<p>Quickly invdividual schools are going to face the same <a title="problems Google has faced with its almost 100 APIs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/12/21/business-of-google-apis-2011/">problems Google has faced with its almost 100 APIs</a> and need to standardize their management platform with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Access</strong> - Usage of a healthy balance of keys and OAuth for accessing school and student data&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Discovery</strong> - Establish some sort of WADL or other discovery service that can feed not just a human directory but IDEs and other programmatic discovery.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Explorer</strong> - Provide an API explorer so developers and even non-programmers can make calls against any API without writing code&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Billing</strong> - Establish some sort of billing layer, if only for making high volume users pay for access and pay for infrastructure--but also possibly opening up new revenue streams for universities</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/universities/univeristy-info-systems.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>In addition to these areas, Universities will have to establish a common set of API building blocks that they will use across all departments, creating a consistent API area for developers to use while learning about and integrating with University Web Services.</p>
<p>With some proper planning and a little work, each University could setup a highly functional API strateg and management framework allowing them to efficiently manage not just dozens of APIs, but thousands across all areas of the University.</p>
<p>Think of the opportunities for students to build out much needed mobile and web applications around school information as part of class projects.  The benefits of having self-service interfaces that individual departments can use to get the information they need, as well as for 3rd party vendors who need access to vital school data.</p>
<p>Next, would be to create a state and federal discovery layer on top of each University, allowing better oversight and interaction between government and Universities--but that will have to come later, we have a lot of work to do at each University before we get there.</p>

<p>I am putting a lot of thought into why we limit API access for developers. &nbsp;I understand requiring keys to access APIs, and tracking who has access to your API, so you can understand how they are using it. What I don&rsquo;t understand is why you&rsquo;d want to limit API access.</p>
<p>By limit, I mean...here is an API, you get 100 calls, then no more! No option for paying, begging or pleading for more access. There are some APIs (I will evaluate specific APIs in the future), that have this approach, and it just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.</p>
<p>Last year I touched on this subject with a post in ProgrammableWeb called,&nbsp;<a title="Should We Be Limiting Developers&rsquo; API Usage" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/01/should-we-be-limiting-developers-api-usage/">Should We Be Limiting Developers&rsquo; API Usage</a>? Where I flip this model on its head and showcase two API providers, YellowAPI and ironically enough Qwerly (another story by itself), and how they were actually rewarding developers for more API usage.</p>
<p>I understand that in the early days, limiting access was a way to keep people from using their APIs too much, but I think in the era of cloud computing, that throttling as opposed to limiting is a better option. Let price control a developers API usage, and set that price at a level that is logical for this equation.</p>
<p>If your limiting developers from using your API, why even have one? It seems like you should sit down and re-evaluate your business model. I hope you don&rsquo;t have other products that your customers can access, that at some point you cut them off and say, you can&rsquo;t have anymore.</p>

<p>Last month, <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/pamphlet/2012/04/27/the-new-harvard-library-open-metadata-policy/">Harvard openly licensed their library meta data</a> and through a partnership with the <a title="Digital Public Library of America" href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/dpla">Digital Public Library of America</a>, made it <a href="http://openmetadata.lib.harvard.edu/content/digital-access-scholarship-harvard-dash-dataset">available via APIs</a>.  But today&rsquo;s story is more about APIs driving the operations side of higher ed at the <a title="University of Washington" href="http://webservices.washington.edu/">University of Washington.</a></p>
<p>Under the Universities of Washingtons web services site, you can learn, discover and connect to 29 separate University APIs:</p>

<p>Its grest to see that the University is trying to create a single directory of all University web services, and even has an API suggestion service where students and faculty can submit and vote on ideas for new, useful campus APIs.</p>
<p><a title="University of Washington" href="http://webservices.washington.edu/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/universities/UW-Web-Service-Registry.png" alt="" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>With the volatility of school funding, online learning and just overall competition in higher ed, Universities need to start noticing of the transformative powers of APIs, and how it can make University operations more transparent, accessible and nimble, and potentially even save money when it comes to empowering the students themselves to build interfaces for accessing vital University information.</p>

<p>Twitter just <a href="http://engineering.twitter.com/2012/05/improving-performance-on-twittercom.html">rolled back their architectural approach for Twitter.com</a> back to a server side implementation.</p>
<p>If you remember back in September of 2010, <a href="/admin/blog/twitter+eats+own+dogfood+api+evangelist">Twitter rebuilt Twitter.com to use a web application architecture</a> that pushed all of the UI rendering and logic to Javascript running in the browser and consumed the Twitter API directly.</p>
<p>Now they are "taking back control" of their front-end performance by moving the rendering back to the server.  They don't say whether they don't use the APIs at all, but I am working under the assumption that they abandoned them.</p>
<p>Twitter felt the API driven web application architecture broke new ground, offered a number of advantages, but it lacked support for various optimization techniques available only on the server.</p>
<p>I was excited to see Twitter go with the API driven approach, along other sites, like <a title="FCC Website" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/04/06/everything-should-be-an-api-says-fcc/">the FCC</a>. &nbsp;I hate to see them abandon it.</p>
<p><em><strong>What does this say about an API oriented architecture?</strong></em></p>
<p>Are we not ready?  Are there are not enough tools for optimization, or the talent to deliver the performance necessary for Internet at scale via API driven architecture? &nbsp;Or maybe there are other business reasons for stopping eating their own dog food and going back to a server side architecture?</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 May 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/url-wrapping-metrics.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m documenting Twitter&rsquo;s process of wrapping the URLs contained within tweets, using a shorter URL like t.co.  I&rsquo;m interested in understanding the opportunities around URL wrapping (aka URL shortening) as an API business strategy.</p>
<p>From an API business perspective, the reasoning for implementing URL wrapping as part of your API would be:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Saving Space </strong>- By shortening URLs you are reducing the length of any string that contains URLs, and in cases like Twitters, every character counts</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - Twitter is actively combating URLs that carry malicious intent</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong> - Each shortened URL provides a mechanism for tracking clicks on URL within content</li>
</ul>
<p>Shold URL wrapping be something API owners adopt for all content served up via an API?  Could every URL within content served up via an API be wrapped, allowing tracking of clicks through that URL--no matter where that content ended up living after it left the API?</p>
<p>Just some initial thoughts, but it seems that a comprehensive linking strategy could be established, bundled with a URL shortening service like <a href="https://bitly.com/">Bit.ly</a>, <a href="http://goo.gl/">Google URL Shortener</a> or a custom service--and provide a new layer of metrics that could be used to tell how your developers and their application users are interacting with the content you serve up via your API.</p>
