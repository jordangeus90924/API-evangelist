{% include JB/setup %}<p>I had the pleasure of being on stage with Tim Herzog (@tgherzog), a Open Data Specialist from the World Bank yesterday at the DC API meetup at NPR.During the QA panel, at the end of the meetup, a question came from the audience, stating that open data from government is often boring, and thus is the reason much of what we see built on government isnt that exciting--alluding that there has to be more high value, exciting data that isnt being released.While I agree that much of the data made available from open government initiatives is boring and stale, and there are probably much better datasets available, I also think this is more of a storytelling problem, than a data problem.After the question was asked, I quickly answered by pointing to my left at Tim Herzog, and said the World Bank does an awesome job at this.If you look through the World Bank data catalog, and spend time looking through their blog, you see a symbiotic relationship between their open data, APIs and the stories they tell on the blog.</p>
